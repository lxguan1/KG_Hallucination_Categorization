RURAL ACCESS: IS VA MEETING ALL VETERANS WHERE THEY LIVE? ---------- THURSDAY, JANUARY 11, 2024 Committee on Veterans' Affairs, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 11:05 a.m., in room 360, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. Mike Bost (chairman of the committee) presiding. Present: Representatives Bost, Radewagen, Bergman, Rosendale, Miller-Meeks, Murphy, Franklin, Van Orden, Luttrell, Ciscomani, Crane, Self, Kiggans, Takano, Brownley, Cherfilus- McCormick, Deluzio, and McGarvey. OPENING STATEMENT OF MIKE BOST, CHAIRMAN The Chairman. I appreciate everyone waiting for us to get through that business meeting but good morning. The committee will come to order. I want to welcome the witnesses here today. We are here today to discuss rural veterans and how VA is ensuring that they have access to health care and benefits they have earned. It is easy to forget that many Americans and many veterans live in flyover country, and that includes me. I am a rural veteran, as many members on this committee are. We understand the needs and challenges, and quite frankly, the frustration of our fellow rural veterans face because they live where they live. Now, my home is 30 miles from the nearest VA facility, and my constituents in the eastern part of Illinois drive some of them 60 miles or more to get to a VA facility. Veterans in other parts of the United States travel a whole lot further than that. Now, one of the witnesses we will hear from today with the Navajo Nation spans three states. Now, over 14,000 Native American veterans live on 27,000 square miles, and the challenges these men and women in rural America face cannot be overstated. Which is why others and I have fought so hard in 2018 to get the Mission Act enacted. The Mission Act and the Community Care Provider Network have transformed VA's delivery of health care and services, especially in rural and remote parts of the country. Now, 5 years after the bill was signed into law by President Trump, I go home and my veterans are still saying the same thing. I cannot get health care and I cannot get my benefits. Whether it is a limited access to high-speed internet so the veterans cannot make their telehealth appointments, or driving over an hour for routine physical therapy, or the inability to find housing near employment opportunities, or having to travel long distances to attend a disability compensation and pension examination, rural veterans face daunting challenges. VA must meet these men and women's needs where they live. While VA has an entire office dedicated to serving rural and remote veterans, I am concerned that this office has not kept pace with the challenging veteran population. We must ensure that the 311,000,000 we have spent on this office and other rural veteran programs are providing real value and not just lip service. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about how we can pave the way for solutions and bridge the gaps and ensure the best quality of life for our rural veterans. I now recognize the ranking member for his opening statement. OPENING STATEMENT OF MARK TAKANO, RANKING MEMBER Mr. Takano. Thank you, Chairman Bost. Rural veterans and their families have long had to navigate the altogether different healthcare experience than their suburban and urban counterparts. From hours-long drives, to appointments, to housing shortages, to limited access to veteran service officers, to file claims, rural veterans experience a unique series of barriers. These barriers are likely to harden in the coming years as hospital closures and healthcare provider shortages in rural areas persist. When the VA Mission Act was passed in 2018, it sought to address some of the healthcare challenges facing rural veterans by creating the Veterans Community Care Program. Now, the goal was to better enable veterans to access care from community providers when such care was not readily available from VA. While necessary, it has not been the bridge to healthcare access for rural veterans that many had hoped. The healthcare infrastructure in rural America has proven too compromised, and in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, too fragile to meet the needs of civilians and veterans. The need for a robust VA presence in rural America remains. Since 2005, more than 100 rural civilian hospitals have closed according to research conducted by the North Carolina Rural Health Research Program at University of North Carolina (UNC) Chapel Hill. Another 87 rural hospitals have eliminated inpatient services. According to the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, 600 rural hospitals, or about 30 percent of all rural hospitals in the country are at risk of closing in the near future. Over half of those are deemed at immediate risk of closing. Again, we are referring here to non-VA community hospitals. One only need look to the newspaper headlines from across the country to get a sense of how serious the closures are. Veterans cannot always rely on the community to be there but they should be able to rely on VA. We carry out this country's moral obligation to the men and women who have served in uniform in part by ensuring they have a healthcare system able to meet their needs no matter the state or territory they live in. There are some things that we simply cannot rely on the private sector to provide. Our postal service, for example, our national defense, our police and fire departments, these are services private industries simply cannot deliver in every place they are needed, especially as there are no profit opportunities or low profit opportunities. This is becoming increasingly true of healthcare. This was most acutely highlighted during the worst of the pandemic. We saw hundreds of private healthcare systems effectively buckle or shrink under the strain of public health emergencies and natural disasters, workforce shortages, and infrastructure challenges. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) was largely able to avoid this. They delivered the highest quality care to veterans, provided world-class infection control, and delivered humanitarian care to thousands of civilians. They did so with a majority of elderly and rural patient population, and aged infrastructure, and an overworked workforce. That in and of itself was an achievement. They served us further by fulfilling VA's role as the backstop to the American healthcare system, aiding nearly every state and territory and dozens of tribal nations. More than 6,000 VHA employees volunteered to deploy to assist civilian or tribal health systems from March 2020 to July 2022. I am so pleased to have with us here the president of the Navajo Nation, Dr. Buu Nygren, to share with us the reality rural Native veterans are facing. Last September I visited Navajo Nation and discussed with the former president the myriad of ways VA can partner with tribes and the Indian Health Service (IHS) to better serve veterans. I am excited to continue that conversation today. Navajo Nation had extensive interaction with VHA during the worst of the pandemic. Dozens of Navajo citizens were transferred to VA hospitals and dozens of staff, particularly nurses, were deployed to IHS sites, Indian Health Service sites throughout Navajo Nation sometimes for months. This collaboration seems to have largely been successful and has prompted many of us to wonder how we might continue collaborations between VA tribes and the Indian Health Service. As communities continue to lose providers, often VA, tribal health programs, and the Indian Health Service are the only providers left. My staff have heard from several tribes over the years about their eagerness to explore collaboration between the two Federal health systems and tribes. Ideas such as dual-use hospitals for VA and IHS where infrastructure and staff would be shared. In situations where there is a need for care but a workforce shortage, providing care to both Federal patient populations could be the solution. Now, we must continue to provide robust support to VA in order to ensure that its workforce and infrastructure remain strong and truly accessible to veterans who need it. I also urge my colleagues to consider how we could really pursue creative solutions to rural access gaps. I believe there are opportunities before us if we are willing to do the hard work. With that, Mr. Chairman, I thank you, and I yield back. The Chairman. I thank the ranking member. We will now turn to our witnesses' testimony. Testifying before us today we have The Honorable Shereef Elnahal, the Under Secretary for Health at the Department of Veterans Affairs. We also welcome The Honorable Joshua Jacobs, the Under Secretary for Benefits for Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as Mr. John Boerstler, Chief Veterans Experience Office of the Department of Veterans Affairs. From the U.S. Government Accountability Office, Ms. Alyssa Hundrup, Director of Health Care. Dr. Elnahal, you are recognized for 5 minutes for your opening statement. STATEMENT OF SHEREEF ELNAHAL Mr. Elnahal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Ranking Member Takano, and members of the committee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the Department of Veterans Affairs efforts to provide health care and benefits to veterans in rural areas. VA is committed to reaching to reaching veterans where they are. Lori Karvonen, a proud mother of a Marine corporal, is helping us do just that through the Veterans Coordination Pilot Program. Lori is proud to serve in her own way as a nurse in the Baraga County Memorial Hospital, a critical access hospital whose patients include many veterans from the local Keweenaw Bay Tribe. Through a partnership with VA, her hospital uses a standardized protocol to screen veterans for medical needs, including social determinants of health. Lori then helps eligible veterans enroll in VA care, schedule appointments, and connect to community services like food assistance, housing, and vocational training. Recently, the caregiver of a veteran identified through screening asked if they could obtain a backup battery for medical equipment as power outages are common in his rural community. Lori's team enrolled the veteran in VA care. Then, through collaboration with the Iron Mountain VA Medical Center and the local Veterans Service Organization (VSO), they obtained the medical equipment needed to manage his chronic lung disease and home blood pressure monitoring for his hypertension. When we spoke with this veteran, he was not only thrilled with his care at VA but asked if we could ``clone Lori'' so that all veterans may have the same experience. Almost a quarter of all veterans, or more than 4,400,000, resident in rural communities like Lori's and face unique challenges that differ widely from their urban counterparts. Geographical isolation creates challenges in accessing VA health care, and through new initiatives in this administration and a commitment to longstanding efforts, VA continues to bridge the gap between rural veterans and the world-class care that they deserve. Bridging that gap first requires enrolling veterans into VA care. Since the signing of the The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, VA has conducted an unprecedented outreach campaign encompassing direct mail, email, radio advertising, and over 2,000 outreach events, including more than 1,000 in rural areas. Through December 2023, VA enrolled more than 500,000 new veterans, over 100,000 of whom through specific PACT Act authorities including 25,000 rural veterans, into VA health care. As part of implementation, VA also developed the Fiscal Year 2023 Rural Recruitment and Hiring Plan to ensure VA has the workforce it needs to meet our obligation. In Fiscal Year 2023, thanks in part to the new authorities in the PACT Act, our healthcare system saw a 7.7 percent growth rate in the total employees onboard in rural facilities, which did exceed our overall growth rate. In addition to strengthening staffing in rural areas, VA meets even more needs for rural veterans with telehealth services, mobile clinics, and transportation services. In Fiscal Year 2023, VA delivered more telehealth services than in any previous fiscal year, including 2,900,000 million episodes of care delivered to more than 770,000 rural veterans. Further, VA launched 25 new mobile clinics to deliver medical services to homeless veterans in particular, many of whom are rural. VA has also made strides specifically in cancer care. Now, with 75 locations serving across the Nation, VA National Teleoncology offers state-of-the-art specialized cancer care across the country. Nearly half of the veterans seen through National Teleoncology reside in rural areas where they otherwise may struggle to have access to an oncologist. VA is also reaching rural veterans through the Close to Me infusion program which has infusion teams travel to clinics across rural areas where the live, reducing travel time and care continuity for veterans in rural areas. Our data has shown that veterans save 536 minutes of their own time on average due to this program and getting their cancer care. Many of the needs of rural veterans also means ensuring American Indian and Alaska Native veterans who are most likely to live in rural areas receive the care and benefits they deserve. In April 2023, VA implemented the Isakson-Rowe Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act, exempting eligible Native American veterans from copayments for their VA health care. That exemption honors our treaties with sovereign nations and addresses healthcare access and disparities for American Indian and Alaska Native veterans. As of December 8, 2023, VA has canceled over $2,100,000 in copayments for over 3,400 eligible American Indian and Alaska Native veterans. VA is also focused in suicide prevention for these veterans with an emphasis on culturally informed interventions. Chairman Bost, Ranking Member Takano, thank you for the opportunity to discuss our efforts to best serve veterans of rural communities. We appreciate your continued partnership as we embrace our collective responsibility to serve those who have served. Thank you.  The Chairman. Thank you, Dr. Elnahal. Mr. Jacobs, you are recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF JOSHUA JACOBS Mr. Jacobs. Thank you, Chairman Bost, Ranking Member Takano, and members of the committee for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss how VA is working to increase access and improve outcomes for veterans living in rural or highly rural areas. VA believes all veterans deserve timely access to world- class health care and earned benefits no matter what they look like, who they love, or where they live. Far too many veterans, and particularly those in rural areas, are unaware of the benefits that they have earned or lack trust in VA to deliver them. To better meet the needs of rural veterans where they are, VA has been engaged in the most aggressive, forward-leaning outreach campaign in the department's history over the past year. In Fiscal Year 2023, the department held over 13,000 outreach events in communities across the country, relying heavily on our VSO state, county, and community partners to encourage every eligible veteran, family member, and survivor to apply for care and benefits that they earned. The results of that outreach can be seen in the historic number of disability claims that were submitted and approved, and in the individual stories of the veterans who have been positively impacted by this outreach, veterans like Rene Kendall, a retired police officer living on a fixed income in the small town of Otto, North Carolina, which is 3-1/2 hours away from VA's regional office in Winston-Salem. In an effort to meet veterans closer to where they live, the Winston-Salem regional office hosted an event in Franklin, North Carolina this June which enabled Rene to speak in person with a VA employee without spending 7 hours in the car. At this VA hosted event, Rene sat down with Misty Allen, a claims examiner from the Winston-Salem Regional Office (RO) to talk about his pending claim. While reviewing his file, Misty discovered there was an incomplete exam form provided by the medical examiner for review at the time of Rene's exam and that he had a recognized presumptive condition related to his service at Camp LeJeune. As a result of this rural outreach event and Misty's attentiveness, VA was able to award Rene retroactive benefits giving him and his wife a little more financial freedom each month on their fixed income. In his own words he said, ``Misty Allen is truly an advocate, and this extra money every month is a godsend. It has made an impact on our lives and helped us get by a little easier every month.'' Though rural communities offer veterans like Rene multiple benefits, the approximately 4,500,000 veterans living in rural communities face unique challenges, like unreliable internet access and long travel distances that limit their awareness of and access to the benefits they have earned through service to this country. Addressing these challenges and others requires a collaborate approach involving Federal, state, and local government agencies, along with VSOs, nonprofit organizations, and local community partners to ensure veterans in rural areas receive the support they need to thrive. In collaboration with our partners, VA is also taking the following actions to better meet the needs of our rural veterans. First, we are keeping our foot on the gas, continuing our data driven, proactive outreach campaign. Second, we have changed the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) curriculum to add VSOs and State Departments of Veterans Affairs to brief transitioning service members at the end of every 1-day VA TAP class, increasing connections to the benefits and services available to them in the communities in which they will reside. Three, we are leveraging technology for more virtual Compensation and Pension (C&P) examinations, increasing utilization of mobile medical units to conduct C&P exams closer to where veterans live, expanding provider networks and the use of other modalities like the Acceptable Clinical Evidence Process, and utilizing automated decision support tools to minimize overdevelopment. Fourth, we have accredited our first two Native American VSOs, the Navajo Nation and the Gila River Indian communities to provide critical outreach and representation to an underserved population. VA is committed to addressing the unique challenges faced by rural veterans but we cannot do it alone. Through a collaborative approach we are working to bridge the geographical gaps that hinder access to health care and other earned benefits for our rural veterans. By utilizing proactive outreach, leveraging technology, expanding resources, and fostering partnerships, we are making significant strides in alleviating burdens faced by rural veterans ensuring every veteran is included in the VA process with a commitment to do more. Thank you for your continued support of veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors. I look forward to answering any questions any members of the committee may have. The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Jacobs. Ms. Hundrup, you are recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF ALYSSA HUNDRUP Ms. Hundrup. Chairman Bost, Ranking Member Takano, and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss our work on the Veterans Health Administration's Office of Rural Health. My testimony today covers findings and recommendations we made in our May 2023 report on the Office of Rural Health. Its mission is to improve the health and well-being of veterans living in rural areas through research, innovation, and the dissemination of best practices. Rural veterans represent a significant portion of our Nation's veterans with about 2,700,000 veterans enrolled to receive VA health care. As has already been noted, rural communities often have fewer resources compared to their urban counterparts which can result in rural residents experiencing challenges in accessing health care. In particular, rural communities often have fewer hospitals, face healthcare staffing shortages, and have limited transportation options as well as inadequate broadband access compared to their urban communities. VA's Office of Rural Health is one of the main offices responsible for taking actions to increase rural veterans' access to care. The office does this by two primary activities. First, it funds initiatives implemented by VA's various program offices. Initiatives expand existing services to medical facilities that serve rural veterans. For example, the office has provided funding to help provide transportation for veterans to VA facilities for medical appointments or ambulance services. Second, the office funds research projects that develop interventions to improve access to healthcare services for rural veterans and then disseminate those interventions more broadly. Research activities are managed by five resource centers which are field-based satellite offices that serve as hubs of rural health research. For example, several projects are looking into new uses for telehealth, such as programs for cardiac or knee rehabilitation. In our May report, we recommended that the resource centers communicate available research funding opportunities across VA. We found that each of the centers only communicated funding informally such as by word of mouth. For example, we heard that some researchers learn about funding opportunities through existing relationships with resource center staff. With only informal communication methods, many researchers may be unaware of funding resulting in missed opportunities for relevant research. By communicating more broadly, the office could reach a larger pool of applicants which in turn would help ensure the research projects the office funds best align with its mission. VA agreed with our recommendation and said that by May 2024, it plans to develop a standard procedure for communicating funding opportunities to researchers across VA. Also in our May 2023 report, we found the Office of Rural Health has taken steps to assess progress in meeting its mission. In particular, we found the office has identified broad outcomes it wants to achieve through strategic goals but it has not defined the specific level of performance that it aims to achieve to accomplish these goals. We recommended that the office develop performance goals that reflect leading practices identified in our prior work such as being objective, measurable, and quantifiable. For example, one of its strategic goals is to reduce rural healthcare workforce disparities. The office collects data on the number of clinicians trained on rural healthcare issues through its initiatives and research projects. In Fiscal Year 2021, for example, it reported that 31,000 clinicians received training through its efforts. However, the office does not have a performance goal identifying how many clinicians it should train each year to help achieve its strategic goal of reducing workforce disparities. By developing performance goals, the Office of Rural Health would be better positioned to measure its performance and ultimately its progress in improving the health and well-being of rural veterans. Setting performance goals would also help inform the office's decision-making about funding for initiatives and research projects and help it determine if there are areas that may need additional focus. VA also agreed with this recommendation and stated that the office is developing a new strategic plan for 2025 through 2029 that will include performance goals with annual growth targets. The office has estimated that it will finalize its strategic plan by this June. In closing, we are encouraged with VA's initial steps to implement our recommendations and will continue to monitor its efforts going forward. This concludes my prepared statement. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have. Thank you.  The Chairman. Thank you, Ms. Hundrup. We will now turn to questions. I will recognize myself for 5 minutes. Dr. Elnahal, last year we discovered that about 9,700,000 of PACT Act money for critical skills incentives was paid to VA senior executives as bonus. Now, that money could make a big difference in attracting providers to rural areas. Has the money been fully recouped? Mr. Elnahal. Mr. Chairman, the money is in the process of being recouped from the executives who received it. The Chairman. Are there safeguards in place to make sure we do not do that again? Mr. Elnahal. Well, one of the first things the secretary did was ask the Office of the Inspector General to do a full lookback on how those decisions were made in error. That is ongoing and we will work closely with the Inspector General on that. The Chairman. Thank you. Mr. Elnahal. That will then, of course, inform our policies to make sure that all of these things are transparent to senior leadership and that we make decisions according to policy and the law. The Chairman. Thank you. Also I need to ask, between 2016 and 2022, the budget for the Office of Rural Health (ORH) grew about 68 percent, and that is about $311,000,000 today mentioned in the opening statement. What meaningful impacts have been made with that $311,000,000 in 2022? Mr. Elnahal. Mr. Chairman, the Office of Rural Health really plays an important role in two main ways--making sure rural veterans benefit from appropriated funds. The first is actually funding research initiatives but also operational initiatives that extend our care to veterans across the country. In multiple ways the Rural Health Office has done that. For example, they have coordinated with our health informatics team and our field leaders to distribute almost 200,000 tablets to veterans across the country to be able to make sure they can have access to telehealth in the convenience of their own home. That also speaks to a partnership we have in the interagency with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). We also have commissioned many studies to figure out what disparities exist as Ms. Hundrup mentioned among rural veterans so that we can bring more resources and more care available. The second main function rural health does is coordinate the actual execution of those funding, of those funds, and make sure that program is benefiting veterans. Everything between our minority veteran coordinators who reach out to American Indian and Alaska Native veterans to our Rural Access Network Growth Enhancement (RANGE) and Enhanced Rural Access Network for Growth enhancement (E-RANGE) programs for mental health are assisted by the Office of Rural Health. The Chairman. I think you have probably in your statement there answered this part of my questions as well but maybe you want to expand on it. What ORH initiatives have the VA adopted across the enterprise as a program model of care or best practices? Mr. Elnahal. Another example, Mr. Chairman, that I have not mentioned yet is the Women's Health Mini Residency Program which has done now over 200 events and trained more than 500 providers refreshing the unique aspects of women healthcare needs and making sure our clinicians are read up on those. In fact, women's health is an increasingly important focus and that is a close collaboration between the Office of Women's Health and the Office of Rural Health. That on top of multiple initiatives to get care as conveniently close to veterans in rural areas as possible really underlies their focus. The Chairman. None of the Offices of Rural Health 35 initiatives placed more providers in the rural areas; is that right? Mr. Elnahal. Well, we have enterprise-wide initiatives that are trying to bring care closer to veterans in rural areas. The Office of Rural Health assists in multiple ways in extending access but we have hired a record number in just one year of providers in rural areas just last year. In fact, the growth rate of rural health--of rural employees rather within our healthcare system exceeded our overall growth rate at 7.7 percent. That is an operational priority that I sent as my first priority last fiscal year, and thankfully, we have seen better staffing in rural areas. The Chairman. I know that a lot of the problems with telehealth is no connectivity. Okay? Would we be better off budgeting and be better spent on facilities and providing like more mobile facilities as well? Mr. Elnahal. Mobile medical units are a very important part of what we do as well. In fact, we just announced in August that we are deploying 25 mobile medical units to assist with homeless veterans including in rural areas. That is just one of many examples. I also mentioned in my opening testimony our Close to Me infusion service and National Teleoncology where we bring providers, you know, over a certain period of frequency to veterans who need chemotherapy in clinics that are closer to them. Normally, chemotherapy infusion services are offered at our larger tertiary centers, our larger medical centers. We know that increasing the convenience and reducing the travel time is just a more reliable way to deliver care for rural veterans. The Chairman. Thank you. My time is expired. Ranking Member, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Takano. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Elnahal, can you talk about some concrete efforts at VA to hire healthcare workers in rural areas, particularly in the area of mental health? What have you been able to achieve? Mr. Elnahal. Yes. Mental health is a major focus of our hiring efforts. We hired thousands of mental health providers and mental health staff last Fiscal Year alone as part of my broader priority of hiring faster and more competitively. We also have programs that are specifically related to veteran outreach and care delivery in rural areas. One of them is RANGE. RANGE is a program that allows for more intensive care coordination for veterans in rural areas who need intensive outpatient mental health services and helps connect them to inpatient services like residential rehabilitation treatment programs when they need it. We recognize that more intensive care coordination could benefit rural veterans and those two programs are just a couple of examples. Mr. Takano. Well, great. Would you agree that Congress has given the department a range of tools, a lot of tools, a lot of authorities to be able to recruit and retain employees? I mean, do we need to give you any more? Mr. Elnahal. Well, I will tell you, the PACT Act authorities, Title IX of the PACT Act helped us significantly in increasing our total employees onboard to the tune of us now having more employees onboard in the healthcare system than at any point in history. More than 410,000 employees in the healthcare system. Everything from recruitment and retention incentives to better loan repayment, to the ability to pay retention incentives up front when people come in has made us that much more competitive. We do have a legislative proposal called the VA Careers Act that would help us be much more competitive with physicians. We were only able to increase physicians onboard by about 2.3 percent last year. That did exceed our previous years because of these enhanced authorities but relieving us of the $400,000 cap, especially for specialty physicians who far exceed on average that amount for many specialties would be extremely helpful. Mr. Takano. We do have a need to increase the specialty physicians. We need to really get serious about that. This hearing is about rural areas. It is especially challenging to get specialty care into rural areas, is it not? Mr. Elnahal. It is, Congressman. In fact, the salaries that folks command in specialty care areas, in rural areas are much, much higher than often we are able to pay. It is why we have had this as our first legislative priority proposal coming out of the administration for veterans for a couple of years now. We know that this will just better enhance access to care for veterans, reduce wait times, and make care better. Mr. Takano. I mentioned in my opening statement, Dr. Elnahal, that rural hospital closures have been accelerating in recent years. How is VA factoring the shrinking footprint of community providers in rural areas into its long-term infrastructure and workforce planning? Mr. Elnahal. Mr. Ranking Member, I completely agree that the degree of closures of critical access hospitals and other healthcare infrastructure in rural areas is highly concerning, especially because of the disproportionate number of rural veterans who need care in our system. In fact, for inpatient care we often rely on these institutions as it stands to be able to meet that care. In response, we have to invest in our direct care system. We are often the only healthcare providers for particular specialties for veterans in rural communities and we absolutely have to hire but also create more infrastructure and be able to get appropriated funds to create that infrastructure especially with this concerning trend of closures. Mr. Takano. Especially with specialty care, being absent even in the private sector, I mean, it is clear to me that care in the community, it does not solve the problem of access to care in these rural communities. I mean, might we have to consider solutions like somehow getting VA's specialty physicians into these areas and possibly sharing them with others in the community that need them? Might we be thinking the other way around instead of thinking, open it up to community. Maybe the communities in these rural areas need VA specialists that can be shared with Medicare and Medicaid and whoever at the Indian Health Service? Mr. Elnahal. Well, the first thing I will say is veterans do disproportionately in rural areas rely on community care, so I do not want to undercut in any way the importance of our Community Care program. These are critical partners for us to deliver timely care for rural veterans. You are right in that there often are not good options in the community for veterans to receive the care that they need. Again, doubling down on our need to build infrastructure. We have a partnership similar to what you are talking about here with the Public Health Service Corps, Admiral Levine recently communicated to us that she intends to have now 200 Public Health Service Corps officers deployed within VA for their healthcare experiences. We will disproportionately deploy them to rural areas. Thinking about other Federal healthcare systems like the Indian Health Service with whom we just renewed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for reimbursement for their services for American Indian and Alaska Native veterans, looking at our partners at Department of Defense (DOD) for enhanced staffing, all of that is on the table for consideration. Mr. Takano. Thank you. I yield back. I am sorry for going over. The Chairman. Representative Van Orden. Mr. Van Orden. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Elnahal, I want to start by thanking you personally. We spoke quite a while ago and I gave you a copy of a letter written by one of my constituents about their brother committing suicide because they could not get an appointment at the VA. I know you have done personal follow up with that widow and that is a standup thing to do. That really speaks to your level of commitment as a public servant. I appreciate that greatly. I live in a very rural district. I mean, this committee hearing is perfect for us. The big complaints that I get from my constituents and it sounds so simple is the removal of a kiosk so that folks could get their travel claims. I guess, Mr. Jacobs, is a travel claim, that payment, is that considered a benefit? Mr. Jacobs. We provide travel reimbursements in instances of C&P exams. If you are talking about reimbursement for medical care that would be handled in the health system. Mr. Van Orden. Okay. Like when I go to the optometrist at the La Crosse VA which is awesome, you are supposed to be able to file for reimbursement for travel. Well, here is the problem. Before you used to be able to just push a couple buttons and it would be your birthday, your Social Security number, and your name, and then it would say, here it is. You would sign it with your finger, direct deposit, done. Now because these kiosks are gone, and it is my understanding that someone forgot to renew the contract during COVID, you have got to do this first. This is a 40-page document about how to do ID.me. You have got to follow all these steps on a computer in order to get an ID.me identification number and then when you are done with that there is this 16-page step-by-step document for people to fill out a travel claim. My concern is this. We have Korean War veterans that have a flip phone that do not understand the technologies involved. We have folks that it has been addressed already that do not have broadband internet. Are you guys taking concrete steps to either get these kiosks back or to radically streamline this process? Mr. Elnahal. Yes, Congressman. I will tell you, I will not mince words on this. We did not do well with this transition with the beneficiary travel online system. We should have codesigned that better with veterans and we should have rolled it out much more carefully. Certainly before decommissioning a process like the kiosks that veterans were used to. It should have been deployed better. I take ownership of that. That has happened over the last several years as you mentioned throughout the pandemic. We will do better. One way that I am ensuring that any veteran has the option if they are not able to use the online system for various reasons they do have the option to file a paper claim to be able to get reimbursed. Mr. Van Orden. I did not bring a copy of that but it is an extensive thing also. My point being this, sir, is that we had something that was incredibly efficient for the veteran. It was perfect. It even could tell you your appointments for the day. We spent so much time deriding a bureaucracy as we should because you were here for the business meeting. You saw that we have an oversight responsibility assigned to us by the Constitution. We had like one thing that really worked and then we got rid of it. That is part of our frustration. Maybe as opposed to redoing this. It is like 70 pages worth of stuff for people that, I mean, I am old, too. He was right. Scott was right. I did not appreciate it but, you know, the truth hurts sometimes. Maybe we could think about reimplementing the system that we absolutely know works. Mr. Jacobs. Well, I commit to you, Congressman, that we will make this better. For the kiosks that do exist, we are not going to be decommissioning them so that at least the veterans who are used to using that process will have that. There are a total of four ways now for veterans to get reimbursed. We just have to do better in redesigning them to making them easier and to be able to do a personal touch with veterans, especially veterans like Korean War vets who are on average less able to use this type of technology. We have to bring a better process to them. That is VA's responsibility and you have my commitment. Mr. Van Orden. Excellent. I would like to continue to follow up with your office because, again, that is like the number one complaint I get from my constituents. I would like to thank you guys for letting me jump ahead. I appreciate it greatly. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. The Chairman. Representative Brownley. Ms. Brownley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. It is nice to see you. It is my understanding that VA estimated that only 8 percent of enrolled rural veterans are women. Why? I mean, that seemed low to me. I am curious to know if there are rationales or reasons for why that is. Mr. Elnahal. I will always start, Congresswoman, by saying that it is VA's responsibility to increase enrollment and increase access to care for veterans no matter where they live or what their gender is. I think the first and most important reason is that we need to do more outreach and we need to reach more veterans in rural communities who are women. We take that very seriously. We have a collaboration between the Office of Rural Health and our Office of Women's Health to be able to do much more outreach. I will pass the baton quickly to Mr. Boerstler to help talk about ways that we are going to reach more rural women veterans. Mr. Boerstler. Thank you, Dr. Elnahal, and thank you, Congresswoman. I absolutely agree. We do have a lot of really great programs to reach more women veterans. As you know, as this committee knows, women veterans are our fastest growing customer population at VA, and we are, especially in the last year and a half, since we have implemented the PACT Act, we have been able to reach more women veterans and increasing their access to benefits and care. In particular, reaching women veterans, and all veterans in rural areas, has become a big focus for us especially as we roll out our VA radio outreach program which has been able to record 60 different public service announcements for different personas like women veterans and Native American veterans and other minority veterans that are in rural areas to be able to reach them if they do not have access to broadband internet or they are not able to go to their nearest facility. We have been able to partner with 150 different syndicates in these rural areas. There is a lot of work being done. We are also proactively text messaging lots of veterans including more women veterans in these areas so that they can have better access to care and benefits. Ms. Brownley. Very good. Mr. Jacobs, you talked about historic outreach. I am just curious to know of the outreach that you did was historic. How many more veterans who are now qualified to receive benefits? Did you capture that number? Mr. Jacobs. In Fiscal Year 2023, we had a 40 percent increase in the total number of claims we received relative to last year which was an all-time high. We also delivered more benefits to more veterans than we ever had in our history. Ms. Brownley. How many more veterans just, you know, who are new to the VA who qualified to receive benefits? Mr. Jacobs. I do not have that number but I will get back to you for the record. Ms. Brownley. Did you have a breakdown at all in terms of men versus women? Mr. Jacobs. I would have to get back to you on that. We do proactively try to conduct outreach targeted to encourage more women veterans to file claims. I do not have those numbers in front of me. Ms. Brownley. If you would provide them I would appreciate it. Mr. Jacobs. Absolutely. Yep. Ms. Brownley. That would be great. Mr. Secretary, you mentioned IHS and the MOU. When was that finalized? Mr. Elnahal. Congresswoman, we announced it at the White House Tribal Nation Summit just last month. Ms. Brownley. Just last month. I am curious because as chair of the Health Committee, a couple years ago we had a couple of hearings on this and I am curious to know, because I know one of the issues was that veterans would use IHS for general health care and then they would use the VA for specialty health care. Then when they went to the VA for specialty health care, the VA repeated a lot of the different tests and assessments that were done with IHS. I am just wondering if the MOU addressed that so that the VA is not doing more tests than they need to do in order to prescribe what a veteran may need in terms of their health care. Mr. Elnahal. Yes. You are describing a frustrating experience, Congresswoman, that I hear all the time for veterans who have to often repeat their histories and where clinicians do not have the information available to them. The MOU was mostly focused on how we will reimburse the Indian Health Service and better coordinate with them to be able to deliver a comprehensive care plan for American Indian and Alaska Native veterans. We have a lot of collaborative work going on to make that process as seamless as possible. Especially in rural areas and for tribal veterans in particular, they often have to go to different systems because of the general lack of healthcare infrastructure. That is why the relationship with IHS is so important. It is why, for example, we opened a couple of more contract-based clinics in the Navajo Nation alone to be able to bring, you know, care closer to the veterans. All of that happened just over the last several months but us working better and more seamlessly with IHS on the ground is extremely important to prevent what you are talking about. Ms. Brownley. Thank you, sir. I yield back. The Chairman. Representative Radewagen. Ms. Radewagen. Thank you, Chairman Bost, and Ranking Member Takano, for holding this hearing. Talofa lava. Thank you to the witnesses for your testimony. This issue is very important to my home district as our veterans must fly thousands of miles to receive anything more than the most basic care. Our veterans in the rural and remote areas deserve the same level of treatment as the rest of the country. Telehealth and other initiatives have come a long way in improving access but there are still gaps to be filled. Dr. Elnahal, Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended that VHA update its guidelines for establishing outpatient intensive mental health care programs. How is VHA planning to revise these guidelines to improve access to mental health services for our rural veterans, particularly those with serious mental illness? Mr. Elnahal. One of the main ways we do that, Congresswoman, is through our RANGE program, which is essentially an intensive case management program that makes sure that rural veterans in particular, including veterans in our territories, are getting the care that they need. You know, an extra hand to be able to coordinate that care, canvass all options including not only VA care but also community care, and making sure the dots are connected for veterans so that the care is both timely and effective is the focus of that program. It is, in fact, focused exactly on what you mentioned, the veterans who need intensive outpatient and in some cases inpatient services for mental health and we are very focused on it. Ms. Radewagen. Thank you. You know, a GAO report from last year indicated that VHA does not analyze mental healthcare data by virality. How does VHA plan to incorporate virality in its data analysis to better understand and address the disparities in mental healthcare utilization between rural and urban veterans? Mr. Elnahal. That effort is more than possible, Congresswoman. The way that we are approaching that is essentially by using this very specific geolocation information for both veterans and our infrastructure to better understand who needs what no matter where they live, including, of course, rural veterans. That report was very helpful to us. It helps us really be able to try to slice the data in the way that is helpful. By the way, helpful not just to folks at headquarters but more importantly, folks who are at the clinics and in the infrastructure in rural areas to better target the veterans they can serve. Ms. Radewagen. Dr. Elnahal, we noticed many of the initiative's Office of Rural Health funds are related to telehealth. How is ORH coordinating with relevant VA offices, such as the Offices of Connected Care, Primary Care, and Specialty Care? Mr. Elnahal. One of the main ways that you see that collaboration is through our clinical resource hubs. Every network in the system, including Veterans Intergrated Service Network (VISN) 21, which serves the Pacific, has a clinical resource hub. Across our system we have about 800 tele-mental health providers in particular that are able to--and in fact, spend all of their time coordinating and providing care to rural veterans via telehealth. That is a collaborative effort between rural health, Connected Care, and the Integrated Veteran Care program. Of course, our operators in the field who execute on that. Ms. Radewagen. What are you doing for veterans that lack broadband internet access or prefer to see providers in person? Mr. Elnahal. We have a collaboration with the Federal Communications Commission that helps us essentially cover the costs vis-a-vis FCC's authority. For much of the broadband and wi-fi services, you know, total bill that veterans need. That number continues to grow for veterans served. Of course, veterans also have to have the devices to be able to use broadband. That really underlies our effort to hand tablets to a vast majority of them are rural veterans, almost 200,000 we have distributed. We calculate that almost 100 percent. About 97 percent of the encounters that we are seeing with telehealth for rural communities is delivered in the convenience of the veteran's home. We will keep trying to expand those programs. We know that rural veterans will continue to meet them. Ms. Radewagen. VA talks about expanding access through telehealth, but 27 percent of veterans do not access the internet at home as you have mentioned and lack of broadband connectivity is still a major issue in much of rural America. Yet, one-third of Office of Rural Health's initiatives are focused on telehealth. What is VA doing to address infrastructure issues? Mr. Elnahal. We have that program with the Federal Communications Commission, Congresswoman, that helps us offer, you know, the ability for veterans to cover the costs of broadband and wi-fi services. Our task is to just make sure every veteran who needs this and who qualifies for it knows about it and that our local teams are letting veterans know about it. We will not know unless we ask the question to veterans when they come in for care, and we just have to do that with every opportunity we have, especially for our facilities in rural areas. Ms. Radewagen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. The Chairman. Representative Cherfilus-McCormick. Ms. Cherfilus-McCormick. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to say thank you to Dr. Elnahal for visiting my office, Under Secretary. Visiting our district, actually, and speaking to the mental health services that are available to our veterans. I wanted to pick up on the question of the tablets that you handed out. One of my first community projects was to actually hand out tablets to connected people to telehealth. One of the things we got back was some people did not know how to use the tablets because they were not digitally savvy. Have you come across that with our veterans who are receiving them? Mr. Elnahal. Yes. I have heard that personally, and we have also had oversight reports, including from the Office of the Inspector General that talked about that and a number of other issues. We are working to change that. We really need to be helping veterans not only, you know, get these tablets but know how to use them and know how to use our applications, like My Healthy Vet and the VA.gov global application. That really needs to be a close, you know, veteran centered education that happens. We are working on that. We are trying to improve the way that we educate veterans on this and provide a helping hand. I view that as VA's responsibility. Ms. Cherfilus-McCormick. How big of a problem is it? Is it a huge problem or a very small problem that you are running into? Mr. Elnahal. Well, the problem varies depending, of course, on the service area and the age of the veteran. We know that rural veterans on average are older. Again, it is really the responsibility of VA in my view to take a full comprehensive approach in helping veterans through that process to learn how to do it. Ms. Cherfilus-McCormick. Now, I have a question about best practices as was mentioned by Ms. Hendrup. What steps are you taking to make sure that best practices are being established especially for our rural veterans. When I go throughout my district I see there is a huge difference with the VA in West Palm Beach, in Miami, and even outside my district. What steps are you guys taking to ensure that they are getting the best services available to them? Mr. Elnahal. Yes. We are addressing the issue of best practices through our Office of Rural Health Promising Practice program. I will just give you one example that was unique to rural veterans. I served in VA. This is my second time serving in VA. My first time I focused on the very topic of spreading best practices. Collaborated with the Office of Rural Health extensively. One of the best practices to get more advanced care directives for rural veterans filed, better to be able to define what they would like to receive in terms of end-of-life care. That should be the veteran's decision and should be a plan well in advance of them needing end-of-life care. They were a really innovative practice where it was essentially group classes and group visits. Rural veterans obviously have more difficulty getting to our brick and mortal infrastructure and so to hold classes like this when we know rural veterans are coming in for care, to educate about advanced directives and on the spot offer the opportunity for rural veterans when they are ready to file their advanced directive. It is one of many best practices that just gets a very needed piece of their care delivered. The Office of Rural Health works with our Innovation team and other members of our team at headquarters to make every corner of our system know what is working for veterans. Ms. Cherfilus-McCormick. Thank you so much. I yield back. The Chairman. Representative Rosendale. Oh, I am sorry. Ms. Kiggans. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you. It has been great to hear about some of the improvements for expanding access to rural health care since I think that is what we are here to discuss. Rural access and VA. Are we meeting veterans where they live? I think there is some room for improvement. We have done good things that you all have mentioned--telehealth, mobile clinics, improving transportation service. That is great but I, as a nurse practitioner, I want to talk about an issue near and dear to my heart, and that is expanding the scope of practice for advanced practice Registered Nurses (APRNs), nurse practitioners, nurse anesthetists. A lot of midwives. There are so many of us that feel such a void for health care, especially for rural health. I know that the VA provided guidance for APRNs in 2016 and you published that report. Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNAs), specifically, were left out of that. Nurse anesthetists were not allowed to practice to the full scope of their potential. I wanted to just note some things from the guidance talked about expanding full practice authority for CRNAs would not harm Team Base Care. That anesthesia care provided by CRNA would not harm team-based care and the anesthesia care provided by CRNAs is equally safe with other physician supervision. This was from that 2016 report. Also in that report the VA believes that a significant shortage of anesthesiologists exist and that this leads to cancellation, delays of surgery in rural settings. I know that after that time the VA partnered with Temple University Beasley School of Law in 2022 for a VA commission duty which concluded, the policy, about the CRNA's, decisions on their standards should be guided by current available data. The data provided in the study shows that removing restrictions on CRNA's had no negative impact on patients. Maybe a cost effective solution to physician shortages and may increase access to care. In the wake of reports on canceled surgeries and acknowledgement that 25 percent of VA facility chiefs of staff reported problems recruiting or hiring anesthesiologists, it is of the utmost importance that the VA reconsider their exclusion of CRNA's from their 2016 rule on the APRNs. Additionally, APRNs, including CRNAs, are typically more accessible to historically underserved populations in geographic areas. For instance, rural facilities which are more heavily reliant on CRNAs for anesthesiology and surgical practices. I guess my question is to Mr. Elnahal. Can you just tell me why? Why are we leaving CRNAs out of the picture? This is a time when we need advanced practice nurses more than ever to fill those voids. They are capable. All of this data, I know I could go on and on about providing that their outcomes are just as good, if sometimes not better than some of the physicians we employ. Why are they left out of the equation? Mr. Elnahal. Well, the first thing I will do, Congresswoman, is identify yourself with your support for advanced practice nurses. More generally, they have been some of my best colleagues in healthcare delivery personally as a physician. I also want to clarify that our current policy is one where advanced practice nurses, and CRNAs in particular, where our medical centers are in states that allow full practice authority for CRNAs. Medical centers do have the authority to extend privileges for full practice authorities in those states. We have many medical centers already doing this consistent with that policy and consistent with state licensing guidelines. The question at hand with the National Standards of Practice is whether or not through our Federal supremacy authority potentially override state licensing restrictions on those professions. That is the question at hand as we look at the national standard for CRNAs. My team tells me that just over the next year or two we are going to see more data that would help in our final decision- making on what that national standard should look like. We want to make sure we have the most up-to-date and important information for us to be able to take that extra step and say VA through its Federal supremacy will grant that authority regardless of what its state licensing regime says. That right now is still deliberative. I have not made a decision on that. My team has not recommended a decision on that yet. Ms. Kiggans. Yes. I do not know how much more information you need to have the outcomes be very obvious that we need these guys. We need them now because we are not providing the care to our veterans especially in those rural health settings again. You know, I come from Virginia, and we recently, only in the past few years allowed for nurse practitioners statewide to have full practice authority. VA led the way. You guys did it first. You were brave. You went out there. You filled that void. I think you can do it in this instance, too. I will be watching as a member of this committee, as a nurse practitioner, and watching and waiting for you all to approve full practice authority for our CRNAs. I know I am running out of time. Actually, I only have 5 seconds. I will yield. Thank you very much. The Chairman. Representative McGarvey. Mr. McGarvey. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for being here today. I appreciate you all's testimony. Dr. Elnahal, thank you for your testimony and for sharing the great work the VA is doing to address the needs of rural veterans and their families. I am thinking particularly of Appalachia and Eastern Kentucky, the state where I am from, where my grandfather is from in that area, and all of the other rural areas that really struggle with access to care and how we better reach them. I am excited to see the telehealth visits are expanding. Two point four veterans have made 11,600,000 million telehealth visits but only 770,000 of the 2,700,000 enrolled, rural veterans, or 29 percent are using telehealth. My colleague, Ms. Radewagen asked a little bit about this, and obviously, we have got to see some more access to broadband, what we can be doing now. Appreciative of the American Rescue Plan and the infrastructure laws that are going into place. I know you guys addressed that a little bit. I am going to talk a little bit about the programs themselves because obviously, we all share the commitment and passion to get health care to our veterans because they have earned it. They have earned it and they deserve it. You have got the at-home screening for colorectal cancer. You have got the remote monitoring for prevention of diabetic amputation. These types of programs. Dr. Elnahal, how does the VA determine how to design these programs, whether a program is working, and how to quickly scale it up? Mr. Elnahal. The best programs, Congressman, in this area have really come organically from our field leaders and field clinicians who understand what veterans need close to the ground as they serve them. You know, a lot of our home monitoring programs for things like congestive heart failure, the diabetes amputation program that you mentioned, started in one or two or more of our medical centers. We are discovering it and lift it up as a best practice and then it becomes supported better and better through our infrastructure. I think that is the best way that we service these really effective programs. Mr. McGarvey. I know you are setting up a new Office of Digital Health as well. Can you tell me about how the VA plans to untether veterans, especially our rural veterans, from just solely relying on the brick and mortar model of care? Mr. Elnahal. The impetus for this office, Congressman, I am glad you mentioned it, is a recognition that digital health will just become more and more of a part of the expectation of patients, not just veterans, but across the country. We have to be leading on this as we have historically with telehealth. The best way to do it in my view is through human center design. That is an office that will have the infrastructure in collaboration with the Veterans Experience Office to be able to work with veterans to understand how technologies can be accessible, how much education are we offering, but how are we designing the programs up front to be able to make it as easy and effective as possible to receive that care. I am happy to pass to Mr. Boerstler for more insights on that. Mr. Boerstler. Well, thank you, Dr. Elnahal. As he pointed out, the human center design or veteran center design in this case is really understanding the pain points, the bright spots, the moments that matter along each customer journey, whether it is a specialty care journey or an outpatient care journey for rural veterans and non-rural veterans alike. We continue to do that in almost every business line. We also consistently monitor on the quantitative side. Through our Veteran Signal or V Signal survey platform we are able to see and monitor the increase in trust in ease, effectiveness, and emotion. I am happy to report there are great scores for veteran access to care for outpatient services in particular which are higher among rural veterans. More rural veterans trust VHA outpatient services than non-rural veterans, as well as emergency medicine, vet centers, and community care. There is a lot of great quantitative data there as well. Mr. McGarvey. Thank you. Just in closing in the time we have left, in you all's opinion, what is the best action we could take now to help veterans get this type of care? Mr. Elnahal. I think, Congressman, ensuring that we have the resources to be able to not only extend the best and most modern technology but also that we have the right workforce in place to be able to lead what is really the digital revolution, especially with the advent of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) would be extremely helpful. We are going to out of our Digital Health Office lift up our AI program to make sure that we are following the trustworthy AI principles that the president outlined in a recent executive order but then put as much potential forward in a safe and secure way to be able to meet veteran needs. Of course that means telehealth. It means as much home monitoring as possible to make things more convenient for rural veterans. Really, everything that we can do to make the daily job, the daily work easier for our clinicians to be able to deliver that care. Mr. McGarvey. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. The Chairman. Representative Rosendale. Mr. Rosendale. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Thank you for holding this hearing. I want to start off this afternoon by thanking publicly Dr. Elnahal. I am known to hold people accountable and raise hell on occasion when things are not being done the way that I would like to see, and I do that publicly. I want to make sure that everyone is aware of the great job that we are seeing right now. Before too long, ineffective leadership oversaw poor hiring procedures and tolerated serious medical malpractice. Veterans suffered as a result, and while there is still work to be done, I am very encouraged with the new leadership at the Montana VA at Fort Harrison. It started to implement changes leading to improve care for our Nation's heroes. I appreciate you and Secretary McDonough for being responsive to my initial letter conducting the preliminary investigation, requiring a comprehensive review, and keeping my office thoroughly informed. Hiring an interim executive director and bringing in the outside help. I made it my mission to fix the Montana VA to ensure veterans receive the best health care possible. I am thankful for your role in this department and these efforts. Again, I want to say that publicly because we have had many conversations over the last several months and the work is bearing fruit. It has really been turning out good. Mr. Elnahal. Thank you, Congressman. Mr. Rosendale. I am passionate about ensuring veterans have easy access to effective healthcare services and believe telehealth is an essential component. In Montana specifically, patients who otherwise would have to spend hours driving to an appointment often having to take time off of work have come to rely on these telehealth services. We saw them expand it dramatically during COVID, obviously, but in Montana it is just a way of life without COVID. Dr. Elnahal, in your testimony you mentioned that for the Fiscal Year 2023, the VA delivered 11,600,000 telehealth episodes to over 2,400,000 veterans. This number was the highest for the VA in any fiscal year. What do you anticipate the demand for telehealth to be for the Fiscal Year 2024? What steps is the VA taking to meet that demand? Mr. Elnahal. Well, Congressman, I appreciate your recognition that we are providing more telehealth than we ever have in history. I can tell you we plan on offering more and more of it because the expectations of veterans in all generations frankly are to receive more and more convenient care. Not only are post-911, Iraq, Afghanistan veterans who are pursuing modern and convenient care, but we have data that also shows that more than 50 percent of rural veterans prefer telehealth as the primary modality. I am going to see if we have modeled what the expected volume should be this fiscal year. I do not have that in front of me right now but we will be sure to get that back to you. I can almost guarantee it will be more telehealth than we have ever done before. Mr. Rosendale. Great. If you could get those numbers to me and then just some kind of summary of how you plan to address that increase, that would be greatly appreciated. As you can imagine, we are challenged with both the broadband and technology issues. In Montana because the state is so rural, some of these areas just are not able to get it, with the travel. That being said, I want to dive into the travel issues. Veterans across Montana have told me about the difficulties with the Beneficiary Travel Self-Service System, especially for some veterans who are not as proficient in technology. This has led some veterans to give up in frustration and not to obtain the reimbursement they have earned. When you are traveling literally hundreds of miles that is a large financial impact. The veterans liked the old kiosk system. I know that you spoke to that a little bit earlier but I was not here. Why is it that we cannot bring back the kiosk system that worked better for veterans? I know that there was fraud and waste involved in it. With the investments that we could make there, we could make improvements for the security of that if that is the problem, and make sure that we still eliminate the waste and fraud while keeping those consumers and veterans happy. Mr. Elnahal. I will just say, Congressman, we have to do a lot better with that system. I will say that up front and admit it to you as I have admitted it to my team. I will tell you that our process for instituting this new system was not done correctly. We did not design it with veterans. That is why we are collaborating more than ever with Mr. Boerstler and his team with the Veterans Experience Office. We are going to keep the kiosks we have but we have to maximize and make the options easier to use for veterans. There are four options now. The VA.gov patient check-in is a new one that we just introduced. We are going to try to educate veterans on that and see if they respond well to it. Similar to my comments before about the Office of Digital Health, we will make sure that we focus on this and make the design much easier to use and better. It is a major focus of ours. Mr. Rosendale. Very good. Thank you so much. I see my time has expired. I would yield back. Thank you. The Chairman. Thank you. Representative Deluzio. Mr. Deluzio. Good morning, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for being here. I want to pick back up on some of the telehealth discussion Mr. Rosendale and you were having, Dr. Elnahal. I recently was at the Beaver County Clinic in my district and saw some technology there for veterans who come in who may not be able, because of internet access or technology, do it from home or do it from where else. I encourage more of that so that veterans can do those appointments perhaps with a specialist. In my case it might be University Drive or Heinz in Pittsburgh, PA. My question though, if VA is unable to offer an appointment that makes someone eligible for fee-for-service care out in the community, they might receive virtual care out in the community. Why should we not consider virtual care as an access standard if VA can provide a virtual appointment? Mr. Elnahal. That is exactly our intention, Congressman. The secretary announced that last year that if we are able to deliver an appointment via telehealth and the veteran agrees and our clinicians think that that is an acceptable modality of care for what they need that that should count toward our ability to fulfill an appointment according to our wait time standards. We are working on that through rulemaking. There will be a number of other elements that help us factor in the importance of telehealth. We strongly believe that again, if the veteran agrees and our clinicians think it is acceptable, we can offer that as satisfactory in meeting the standards. Mr. Deluzio. Thank you. Please proceed as best you can there. I mean, one of my overarching concerns, I mentioned this to Secretary McDonough when he was here last year. It was the ballooning cost for fee for service care side of the ledger relative to what we are seeing at VHA. I am not going to cite you every study but, of course, VA's own systemic review study which I think now is looked at 57 studies itself continually shows the bulk of the findings of the VA is doing as well, if not better than care, a free for service. They are out in the community. I mean, even on wait times in particular that was stark to me how much better VA is doing, what that stark to me how much better VA is doing, what that trend looks like relative to providers out in the community. My great fear is we are not investing in VA's ability to give and relying on a community care fee-for-service network that there are provider shortages that many of us see in our district and communities that we should be strengthening VA. Would love to hear your perspective of, you know, can VA scale up? Should we be? What are your thoughts here? Mr. Elnahal. I agree with your perspective, Congressman. You mentioned the studies. We also participated in Centers for Medicare and Medicaid's (CMS's) overall hospital quality start rating system for the first time just this past fall. When we released our results, 67 percent of our medical centers score either four or five stars on that rating compared to fewer than 50 percent of hospitals in the private sector. Overall, our direct care system provides exception care. These are people who focus squarely and only on veteran care by definition. We have some of the best researchers expanding the pie of knowledge and the services that we can offer, new treatments, effective treatment. We do rely on the community though when we cannot offer timely care to veterans. That is a backstop. That is still important specially for rural veterans. Investing in a direct care system has been among my top priorities to include more than 61,000 people we hired just in Fiscal Year 2023 alone to make sure we have the team in as many areas of the country as possible and growing our healthcare workforce in rural areas by 7.7 percent in just one year. Mr. Deluzio. Well, and I will point to a couple of these findings. I know I do not have a ton of time but one about a study of veterans who live within 20 miles of VHA facility and comparing those sent to private hospitals for emergency treatment. The mortality rate was much worse than the private hospitals. That gives me cause for alarm. I think we should get veterans we should be investing in VA so the veterans are getting that better care. I also point to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) report last year on prescription of opioids. Then the lack of oversight we were seeing in the feel for service community care providers. The ranking member and some of my colleagues and I sent a letter to VA, which we await a response. One, any update on when we will hear that response, and two, I will urge that we have at least scrutiny you are seeing in VA on those prescriptions when it is happening out in the community as well. Mr. Elnahal. It is an extremely important issue, Congressman, and I regret that we have not gotten that response back to you yet. I will ensure that is our top priority and correspondence to get that back to you. What I will say is, you know, we have an oversight responsibility over this. We know that there are some levels of redundancy on this. You know, there are a lot of states and there are to some extent Federal oversight requirements on opioid prescribing. We require folks to look at essentially what is a public data base, patient by patient, on what opioids they have been prescribed historically. The prescription drug monitoring programs that we engage in. Our responsibility is to veterans no matter where they get their care. If they are being too many opioids, VA has to be on first in identifying that and holding our community provider partners accountable. Mr. Deluzio. Mr. Chairman, thank you. I yield back. The Chairman. Dr. Miller-Meeks. Ms. Miller-Meeks. Thank you very much, Chair Bost, and thank you for holding this hearing. Quite honestly, it has been apparent to me so I am both a physician and a veteran, married to a veteran who is also a nurse, and I was a nurse prior to becoming a physician. It is very apparent to me when I talk to veterans in my community and as a physician providing care that the Mission Act is not being fully implemented by the VA. That became readily apparent when we had our Health Statement of Benefits (SOB) on residential mental health and substance use disorder where the VA did not even think that residential mental health and substance use disorder fell into the parameters of the Mission Act. Therefore, getting a patient in within 30 days was not part of that type of care. I am just going to be blunt here. Color me unimpressed. You can take accountability for the fact that you got rid of a kiosk system to me is bureaucrats deciding this would be a great idea. We are going to do this. Guess what? Just like Electronic Health Records (EHRs), we are not going to talk to the people that use these systems. We are not going to talk to veterans to find out what they want, what makes it easier. You have had multiple complaints. You know about the complaints. Veterans complain about it but we have not done anything. Whatever money we thought we were going to save by getting rid of the kiosk, that money is now invested into increasing VA employees to train people how to do stuff instead of, and this is the same for the Office of Rural Health Care, and believe me, I have done this as a physician, we need people who deliver care. Not people who study care. It is great that you are talking about advanced directives. All patients should have advanced directives. Do we have to set up a training program, go out into rural areas to make sure veterans have access to knowledge about advanced directives rather than when they are at the facility it is done? I do not care to increase the bureaucracy of the VA with people who are not delivering care. What I want is for people to receive care. We should not have to do a bill that says if you need residential mental health care and you need substance use disorder treatment that that has to be within 10 days because the VA does not see it within their parameters to deliver that care. Or that you go to another VISN that is 200 to 300 miles away from your home. Or that we are going to call you the day before your appointment to make an appointment which we get under the 30-day timeline because we do not want people going out to the community. Absolutely there should be oversight of care wherever that care is delivered. Fully supportive of that. I am not supportive of people who know what their problems are, know that there are access of care issues because people can get into the VA, but yet do not want them to receive community care in a timely fashion. I think this is both for Dr. Elnahal and for Mr. Jacobs. Has there been a decrease in veterans filing for travel claims? Mr. Elnahal. To my knowledge, Congresswoman, that is not the case. I think we are seeing more travel claims but I have to get that back to you for the record. Ms. Miller-Meeks. Yes. I know veterans who are not filing for travel claims because of the difficulty of doing that. Dr. Elnahal, how is the VA ensuring optimal diabetes management for rural at-risk veterans to prevent foot ulcers and amputations? Mr. Elnahal. Yes. It is a really important program that we have, not only care that we provide in-person for wound care and ultimately diabetes management to prevent the need for amputations. We also have a remote monitoring program and a telehealth program specific to that, again, supported by the Office of Rural Health. We have seen some really promising results that I am happy to send to you and your team, Congresswoman. We want to expand that offering as much as we can. Ms. Miller-Meeks. I certainly think technology can truly help to get access, especially with cameras, our digital ability to do things that we have not had in medicine. I am just going to say, it is one thing to take ownership of problems that you know about but one of the things that very frustrates our veterans and our constituents is that there is never accountability. You still have your job despite developing a program, rolling out a program that has been extraordinarily cumbersome for veterans. Our Rural Health Care Office, it is great to study whether or not veterans can have access to studies, especially if their study is cutting edge on medications to treat disease. What I want to know is are outcomes improved? Do we have less veterans committing suicide? How are we treating Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)? What is our cancer cure rate? What is our amputation rate for our diabetes? I have volunteer organizations in my district, volunteer, receive no money from the VA, are not VA employees, who actually do a job, a better job of reaching out to veterans and taking them down from a suicide risk and treating their PTSD only because they are just there to serve veterans. That should be our goal and our mission. Thank you very much. I yield back my time. The Chairman. Representative Budzinski, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. Budzinski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member, for this opportunity. Good morning everyone. Thank you to all my colleagues and the witnesses for your time today to discuss the urgent issues around rural healthcare access in particular. I represent a very rural district in central and southern Illinois, and I have heard concerns from veterans back home about the need to expand health care. I have especially heard this concern from our women veterans. In September, I hosted my first Women Veterans Roundtable in the district, and among the issues mentioned was a lack of awareness of women specific services provided by the VA in rural areas. I would like to use my time to focus on our women veterans in particular which leads me to my first question for Dr. Elnahal. What are some examples of initiatives and research projects funded by the Office of Rural Health that focus on women veterans living in rural areas and their access to health care? How is that office helping to disseminate information about services and resources to our women veterans in rural areas? Thank you. Mr. Elnahal. Yes. It is a mandate that we take very seriously, Congresswoman, to make sure that we are the ones getting women veterans connected to care, enrolling more women veterans. The fastest growing demographic by far is women veterans. Of course, for women veterans in rural areas to make sure they get the care they need. The first program is the Women's Health Rural Mini- Residency program which really primes our providers in rural areas to understand the unique needs of women veterans. Our Office of Women's Health leads that. We have already trained more than 500 providers using this over 200 events. We continue to grow that offering. We also have the Women's Health Care Rural Coordination Program for essential screening that is gender specific, so breast cancer and cervical cancer screening. We have seen an uptick in screening as a result of that program thankfully and we continue to want to expand that. We also have specific offerings for women veterans in tribal areas. American Indian and Alaska Native veterans through just offering better cultural care. I will ask Mr. Boerstler to help supplement the outreach we are doing for women veterans as well. Mr. Boerstler. Thank you, Dr. Elnahal. Thank you, Congresswoman. I actually wanted to mention this earlier but we did not have enough time. We hosted our first Women Veterans Experience Action Center last fall. It was a national program really focused on increasing access to VA Benefits Care, Appeals, Cemetery Memorial Affairs services is really successful in partnership with all the offices and many of the women veteran service organizations in the country. Another great example is in South Dakota, which is a highly rural state, we have about eight Community Veteran Engagement Boards. It is all run by a one woman veteran, an Army veteran named Jill Baker. She has been hosting listening sessions throughout the state focused on women veterans and outreach and access to VA care and benefits in partnership with representatives from our VA facilities in the state and surrounding areas. There are a lot of best practices out there that we are really anxious to share and continue to increase access for benefits and care for women veterans across the country. Ms. Budzinski. That is really great. I would love to find an opportunity to build something out like that within my own district to help specifically women veterans and maybe we could lean on you and follow up with your office specifically about how we can get tapped into kind of those best practices that you mentioned. I would really appreciate that. My next question is for Ms. Hundrup. I know the GAO has looked into VA health care for rural vets. Do you have any input based on what you have found on how health care for women veterans in rural areas can be improved as well? Ms. Hundrup. I would just underscore what has already been stated. I mean, I think just the first is the recognition and the acknowledgement and having the awareness and really looking at the data first and foremost. We have got to understand and analyze it by rurality, by gender to know, and then recognize the unique needs. For instance, we have talked a lot about hospital closures. I think the VA pays for maternity care. It does not offer those services and we are seeing obstetric units closing as with other hospital closures around the country. Just having that awareness and then being proactive and taking action in terms of outreach and getting those services. Ms. Budzinski. Okay. That is great. Can I just go back to Mr. Elnahal, maybe just giving an opportunity to further elaborate on some of this work? If at all, are women veterans represented as an area of focus within the Office of Rural Health Strategic Plan or its research agenda in particular? I have heard from women veterans and their organizations specifically the research side is sometimes kind of lacking as it relates to specific outcomes related to women veterans. I am just curious if you could speak to that, too. Mr. Elnahal. I would say, Congresswoman, that our Office of Women's Health, which by the way reports directly to the Under Secretary for Health, is taking the lead on research for women's health services. In fact, we have an incredible leader over that area. She has done incredible work over the last many years, Dr. Becky Yano, who really commissions health service researchers across the country, helps fund those studies, and supports them. I had a chance to address our women's health researchers just a few months ago and they continue to develop insights on where we are seeing inequity, where we need to place more services. What I am trying to do is make sure that our operation responds to those findings swiftly and that informs our infrastructure planning, our hiring planning. Women veterans, especially in rural areas deserve that. Ms. Budzinski. Okay. Yes, I would love to follow up with your office and those offices and folks just to hear more about how I can integrate some of those ideas into the work we are doing. Thank you very much. I yield back. The Chairman. Representative Ciscomani. Mr. Ciscomani. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to all our witnesses also for coming before the committee to lend their perspective on the issues facing rural veterans. With over 70,000 veterans in my district, in District 6 of Arizona which encompasses large sections of rural areas, I am constantly looking for ways to identify gaps of discrepancies in access to housing, medical examinations, and care. I have worked hard to address barriers to access to care for our veterans, specifically disability exams for our rural veterans. Through two different pieces of legislation I have aimed to increase the number of exams conducted and ease in which our veterans can access exam providers. My bills tackle these challenges by not only expanding the pool of providers who can conduct exams but also expanding the ability for providers who provide care across state lines. Further, I worked with Chairman Tom Cole to introduce H.R. 4155, the Tribal Department of Housing and Urban Development- Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Act of 2023, which would make permanent the HUD-VASH program, a critical effort that ensures our tribal veterans have access to quality housing as well. Veterans of all walks of life deserve a safe place to call home. Now, ensuring those who sacrifice have the opportunity to receive the care and respect they were promised is one of my top priorities here in Congress. The Federal Government has a solemn duty to ensure our duties have the care and respect they were promised. This is a responsibility I do not take lightly. Now, as my first question here to Dr. Elnahal, to your knowledge are there any steps being taken to specifically reach and inform female veterans in rural communities about relevant VA healthcare services, especially in regard to maternal health? Mr. Elnahal. Yes, Congressman. We take very seriously the need to focus very closely on the care coordination for women veterans. Every medical center in the country to include our rural facilities has a women's health coordinator to be able to guide the care and make sure that we are not seeing lapses in care or unanswered phone calls or missed appointments. These coordinators have a very busy plate. They are some of the best professionals we have. That is just part of our standard work every day. For example, if a woman needs maternity care if she becomes pregnant we have a very intensive care coordination program that helps guide that care in the community because we do not provide direct obstetrical services in our direct care system. Those are just a couple of examples. Mr. Boerstler also mentioned our Community Veteran Engagement Boards. I am not sure if you have further comments on outreach. Mr. Boerstler. Especially in the Veteran Experience Action Centers we have hosted successful engagement in American Samoa, other Pacific Islands, Michigan, Indiana, Montana, other highly rural states, and we would love to do the same in Arizona in the coming months and years, Congressman. These Veteran Experience Action Centers are essentially 3-day enrollment sprints where veterans will have access to the Veterans Benefits Administration, Health Administration, Cemetery Administration, and the Board of Veterans Appeals to solve their issues. In many cases they are talking to multiple administrations about multiple issues they have. The experience scores that we are seeing from these events are in the 90th percentile. We do a specific outreach to women veterans and minority veterans and Native American veterans so that we can increase the enrollment in those events from those populations. Mr. Ciscomani. Well, I definitely want to know more about that. That actually leads into my next question. That is directed to you, Doctor, but either one of you could answer. How does the office of Rural Health measure, you guys measure the impact and the effectiveness of the mobile medical units, as well as mobile vet centers in improving healthcare access and outcomes for rural veterans? Also, if you could mention what steps are taken to adapt these services based on the feedback and needs of our rural veteran communities? Mr. Elnahal. Our mobile medical units, Congressman, just have an incredible infrastructure that can travel around very flexibly. They have areas for being able to draw labs within the vehicle. They often have the ability to beam in, to have any provider through telehealth who might be a specialist to come in and serve veterans, and so just really important assets. We have seen from the GAO, but also other oversight bodies the need for us to better track where these mobile medical units are going, how they are being used, and what the outcomes are. Candidly, that is something we need to work on and better develop in order to meet those recommendations. We have concurred with all of them. We just want to make sure that we are making maximum use of these assets to reach as many, especially rural veterans as possible who could most benefit. Mr. Ciscomani. Well, it is definitely the goal. Also back to your point also, Mr. Boerstler, regarding expanding this to Arizona and those services, I think that is critical. I look forward to working with you on all this. Thank you so much. Chairman, I yield back. The Chairman. Dr. Murphy. Mr. Murphy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for coming. I appreciate what you all are doing on the work on behalf of veterans. I am very blessed to be in a district in eastern North Carolina where about 10 percent of my constituents are veterans. Camp LeJeune is there, Cherry Point, New River Air Station. Multiple other military communities that are there. It is a huge, huge aspect for us. On the other hand, we are also an extremely rural area. When practicing full time, I still practice some, we had a 29 catchment rural area, one major hospital. It is a huge burden, difficult. One of my colleagues mentioned earlier that he thought, he read one study where veterans got worse care at a private institution. I want to read that study and pick it apart because as you guys well know, most of our literature is nonsense. I would love to see what that means because that is just the opposite of the experience I have had. One thing before I want to get into some of my questions. Dr. Elnahal, can you tell me what these executive bonus things we started out the committee meeting was about? I am going to just preface it by saying I am appalled by the hospital administrator bonuses that go on across this Nation when the people who are actually taking care of the patients, doctors and nurses do not get them and all these other things. The administrators getting the money frankly pisses me off. If you will go ahead with that. Mr. Elnahal. Well in short, Congressman, we discovered that bonuses occurred that were outside what we thought was legislative intent and outside of our policy. Upon discovery of that we made the decision to retract those bonuses for headquarters executives. Mr. Murphy. I get the whole thing about competition in this country but it is also, it is something that is played explicitly, well, we are going to lose somebody who is competitive. That is nonsense. Anyway, let me get back to actually the meat of what I would like to ask. I think it is becoming more and more and more apparent to the country that we are experiencing an overall shortage of physicians and it is going to be apocalyptical in the next 3 to 5 years with a shortage of surgeons, especially those who, we are getting Medicare cuts day in and day out. I know that the VA has sometimes a hard job in competing with hospitals who get extra money now because of some of the subsidies they get and everything. I understand the pressures that you guys have in recruiting. I really do, because it is a real world situation and some of the previous administrations, some of the laws put into place make it so much more difficult. If you look at tertiary consequences down the road and what has happened to our physician community, it has turned into, and I will just say it this way, just with so much employment of physicians it has turned into so much of a transitory physician market rather than ones who come down and put their roots in communities. That is even worse I think affected with the VA. I would really love to know, you know, the VA cannot do it all. As you and I talked on the phone the other night, the fact that you thought that the VA efficiency was 60 percent compared to medical centers which compare to private practice is normally about 60 percent. We are really looking at a depletion in efficiency how you are, one, going to fix that, and two, how are you going to use the private community and the private world to assist our veterans? I do not believe that nonsense about getting worse care at a private institution than at the VA. I really want to know your strategy for fixing it. Mr. Elnahal. Well, Congressman, I appreciate you asking that because we are here to provide the best quality but also the most timely access possible to veterans. Access really just means how many veterans we are able to bring through the door in a timely way through our clinics across the country. That is why the first thing I announced as a major priority was to hire enough clinicians to be able to do the job. The more clinicians we have on board, the more timely we will be able to see veterans. The second thing we did was double down on a strategy that we call bookability, which is to really make sure that every provider uses the time that they are booked as clinical, to fill that time by at least 80 percent with veterans scheduled into their clinic. The rest of the time should be for walk-ins, for same day care when needed on an urgent basis, and to take care of some of the important documentation work and other tasks that physicians have to do. That 80 percent standard now we are enforcing across the country. We did see an improvement in clinician productivity overall in Fiscal Year 2023. We are going to continue to double down on that and make sure that we make most use of the direct care system as possible. Your second question on community care, when we are not able to meet timeliness standards or when we have infrastructure that is too far for veterans, we do offer community care as required by us under the Mission Act. That will continue to be a critical piece of what we do. In fact, we are now as of last Fiscal Year nearly a $30,000,000,000 payer for care. Especially in rural communities we will need to be relying on community care for at least a portion of a lot of veterans' care. Mr. Murphy. I appreciate that. I would ask that you look at actually Community Care actually paying people because I took care of veterans for so long and we never got paid in Community Care. It is a difficult job with turnover and I am not asking you guys to be slave drivers because there is competition that goes out there. Asking somebody to do 80 percent of 100 percent of a job with allowing for work-ins is not asking too much. One quick question and I will just maybe follow up with somebody else because I know my time is overdone, is the VA part of the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) system, the drug reporting system? Mr. Elnahal. I am not aware of that, Congressman. Mr. Murphy. The reason why I ask this is because different states, North Carolina, we have a system which some idiot in the State House wrote, that was me, that just looking at drug usage and everything before you prescribe an opioid or anxiolytic you have to query. The thing is it has to be nationwide because some people can jump right across borders. If you are not interfacing with the private community system also there are people that are going to be gaming that system. Mr. Elnahal. Now I am tracking, Congressman. We do have what we call the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program and we participate, the last I checked with at least 49 states' programs to be able to query that. Mr. Murphy. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. The Chairman. Mr. Crane, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Crane. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Jacobs, your testimony stated that VA held 436 claims clinics across the country. What is VA's plan for ensuring that rural veterans, rural community, and Native American tribes are aware of the options to request a claims clinic? Mr. Jacobs. Yes, Congressman, thanks very much for that question. What we have identified at a national level is that we are serving rural veterans at a slightly higher percentage than urban veterans in terms of benefits utilization but that highly rural veterans are being served at a slightly lower percentage. Now, that varies in community by community. As an example, I was talking with our regional office director in Oakland earlier this week, and he shared with me that the rural communities that he serves are having a lower benefits utilization rate--or actually, they have a higher benefits utilization rate than their urban counterparts. If you go to other parts of the country the inverse is true. The way that we are getting at that is we are utilizing a population mapping tool so we can look state by state and county by county to determine where we have penetrated the communities where we are appropriately serving veterans and we can target those areas that are underserved. We are using that tool to drive the decisions about where we go to conduct claims clinics and we are doing that in partnership with the State Department of Veterans Affairs, with county veteran service organizations and officers, with our VSO partners, and increasingly with the tribes. Mr. Crane. On that, Mr. Jacobs, why do you think that is? Why do you think in rural communities our veterans are accessing these facilities more? Mr. Jacobs. I think they are accessing benefits in some cases because they have got incredible local resources. We have incredible partners in the county VSOs who do wonderful work in educating veterans about their earned benefits and helping connect them to those earned benefits through the filing of their disability claims. I think in some cases it is network and word of mouth, and so understanding where there are opportunities and community members and friends helping one another. I also realize that is not true in every part of this country. Mr. Crane. Thank you. I have got to follow up on that real quick, sir. Which program office should Native American tribes contact or request a claims clinic? Can you assure me that their request will be fully considered? Mr. Jacobs. They can contact my office and certainly I would be happy to work with you. One of the things that we have done is we are now for the first time ever accrediting tribal veteran representatives. Mr. Crane. How do they contact your office, Mr. Jacobs? Mr. Jacobs. My email is Joshua.jacobs@va.gov. Send me an email. We also have a veteran service organization liaison that will help, and every single regional office director would be happy to help as well. Through partnership with the local regional offices, through the contact at the national level, through our VSO liaison, we can help identify where there are opportunities to pursue in collaboration with local tribes additional claims clinics. Mr. Crane. How does the VA prioritize these claims clinics from rural and some of the tribal nations? Mr. Jacobs. We are looking at the more broadly. As an example, the three of us were in Nashville late last week for the Student Veterans of America conference. While we were there we had staff who were there to help veterans file and process claims. We had folks from our Medical Disability Examination Office, from our Education Service Office, and we had mobile medical units from our four vendors who conduct the C&P exams on the ground to help with veterans. We were able to help hundreds of veterans on the ground. We identify events like that, large VSO conferences, but we are also identifying using that tool that I mentioned where there is great unmet need. We do it both from a data driven perspective, but also based on the input that we are getting from our partners where they are hearing anecdotally where there may be unmet need. Mr. Crane. Is it geographical distance to a facility? Is that how you guys prioritize? Let us say you have got 10 requests but you only have five resources, who gets priority? That is what I am asking. Mr. Jacobs. It really is case by case. I cannot provide a uniform answer but what we are doing is looking where can we get the most bang for the buck. In some cases we have very low percentage utilization in a small population. We are still going to have to make that decision. I think there is value in going there even if we are not able to serve as many veterans because we have identified an area where there is not enough benefits being utilized. In other cases, we are going to make a different decision and it really just depends on the circumstances. Mr. Crane. Thank you, Mr. Jacobs. Mr. Jacobs. Yes, sir. Mr. Crane. I yield back. The Chairman. Representative Self. Mr. Self. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is for pretty much the entire panel. I continue to be frustrated with the VA solution to everything is more inputs. We never see health outcomes. You all believe that you solve a problem by throwing more money at it, a new organization, a new position. I never hear that we have had a decrease in diabetes. We have had a decrease in heart conditions. We have had certainly suicides. I just ask you, Ms. Hundrup, I would ask you to start measuring that because in your testimony the 300,000,000 that was totally uncontrolled or accounted for formally, I would ask you to start measuring health outcomes because all of this process, all of this infrastructure that we are discussing today, what is the benefit? Not that they use a benefit the way you term it but what is the health outcome benefit to our veterans? I do not see it in any of these testimonies written. I continue to be frustrated with how much better off are our veterans because of VA, as opposed to just throwing another process, another organization and some more money at it. While I am on money, I have already told the VSOs that we need to get a better handle on offsets. The only offset that this committee has is charging veterans additional home financing fees for a new program. We are charging veterans for every new program that we put into the VA. That is not an offset to me. An offset to me is when we say this is a very noble program. We must have this program. It is vital that we have this program. What less noble program are we going to find an offset in? Every program is noble but a less noble program, what are we going to find an offset in? That is the rules of the road here. We find an offset. I do not think the housing finance fee that we charge veterans is an offset because it adds to it. I have got the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is a problem. I understand the scoring issue. Those are two issues that I wanted to highlight. I am not sure which of you is going to answer this but what percentage of claims is actually filed by an outside organization? My rural VSOs tell me that they believe that it is like 90 percent of all claims are not started within VA. They are started by some VSO. Is that true or not? Mr. Jacobs. Yes. I do not have the exact numbers. I will follow up and get them so I am not misstating. We rely very heavily on accredited representatives like VSOs and county VSOs to help veterans. They do that for free. We are increasingly concerned about other actors coming in and trying to charge veterans for something that they have earned through their military service, but we do rely on outside entities to help veterans pull together, explain information. We are available at all of our 56 regional offices. We have got a national contact center. We have got a website, other public outreach events where we go and try to explain it but we rely on and we value very much---- Mr. Self. Okay. I would like that figure if you can get it to me. My rural VSOs also say that when they go onto your website--this may have been covered by one of my colleagues in a different format--they bring up their current claim. One of them showed me his current claim that shows the documents that supposedly have been put in to justify that claim. They are not live linked anymore. They are dead documents. When you copy the PDF and you put it in it goes nowhere. That is concerning to my rural veterans because they cannot get a true picture of the status of their claim. I would just ask you to look at that and I would like a response on that as well. Mr. Jacobs. Yes, Congressman, I would ask if they are rural VSOs that you have been talking to, I would like to meet with them to talk about the issue and I will bring in my team and we will make sure we go through that directly. Mr. Self. Absolutely. We will set it up. Hunt County, Texas. Hunt County, Texas is where you are going. Mr. Jacobs. Love it. Mr. Self. I want to just ask you a general question. I have got 30 seconds so my question is, how do our rural veterans' health care compare to the rural citizens who are not veterans? Do we have a feeling for how they compare? Mr. Elnahal. Well, Congressman, you know, we could do analyses on healthcare outcomes per your previous comment. I can tell you that our medical centers do score very highly whether rural or not on CMS's overall hospital quality star rating. That is actually a pound for pound comparison between VA Medical Centers and private sector medical centers. More than two-thirds of our medical centers score at the top two ratings compared to only about 42 percent of the private sector. Many of our four and five star medical centers are in rural areas. Mr. Self. Okay. Very good. Thank you, Chairman. The Chairman. General Bergman, you are recognized. Mr. Bergman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Elnahal, I saw that you called a few days ago. I am sorry I was not able to take your call. I was driving so I was not doing anything illegal or would get me a ticket. Mr. Elnahal. No problem, Congressman. Mr. Bergman. The point is I understand you were talking about one of my constituents when Secretary McDonough and I were up in Baraga. Mr. Elnahal. Thank you for correcting me. Mr. Bergman. Just think of, we have a lot of black bear in the area. It is a wonderful part of our environment. Just think of coming into that little town and seeing a bear looking you in the eye. It is Baraga. Mr. Elnahal. I will not get that wrong again. Mr. Bergman. I had the same conversation with Secretary McDonough when he had the same challenge and we laughed about it. They are good folks up there. Let me ask you a quick question here. You know, in your testimony you describe how it is consistently more difficult to recruit physicians in rural areas, probably other healthcare providers as well. It is my understanding that the VA allows for independent certified registered nurse anesthetists--that is a tough one for me. Maybe Baraga for you but anesthetist for me--practice in about 40 VA facilities typically in more rural areas. Does the VA see a difference in either outcomes or patient satisfaction at those facilities compared to others where you are, you know, not so rural or not so remote? Mr. Elnahal. That is exactly the question, General Bergman, that our team is deeply analyzing now with our own data, to understand whether there are differences in outcomes. I have not seen data that has shown worse outcomes, whether it is rural or urban areas. The question we are trying to answer with the National Standards of Practice is whether we override state licensing restrictions on CRNAs. As you mentioned, we do authorize CRNAs independent practice in states that allow that under their licensing system. Mr. Bergman. Okay. To discuss one specific program, last month GAO found that VA was not reliably collecting or reporting performance data on its MMUs, Mobile Medical Units, which provide a wide variety of care to veterans that literally cannot--they do not have internet. They cannot get out of their house to get to a provider. How does the Office of Rural Health measure the impact and effectiveness of mobile medical units for rural veterans? What steps are being taken to adapt these services based on the feedback, so the loop? Service provided, feedback loop, modifications. Any comments on that? Mr. Elnahal. Well, the first thing I will say, General, is that we concurred strongly I would say with GAO's insights on our need to better track what mobile medical units are doing. The outcome that we track should be quite simple. It should be access to care. It should be wait times for care. If we are not making access more convenient for veterans with mobile medical units, then we are not sending them to the right places. We have what we call our North Star metrics for access, which is simply the wait time for direct care, the time it takes to schedule community care, and what veterans are telling us through surveys on access. Mobile medical units have to be improving all three of those for us to know that it is working. Mr. Bergman. The reason I ask is not necessarily to be answered now but again, in our neck of the woods, literally, not all of our folks who live there are going to be veterans and be eligible for the mobile units. If there is something going on outside of veterans health care with other entities, I would very much like to hear where there is a sharing of information because care is care in the rural and remote areas. I have 45 seconds left. Ms. Hundrup, you have been sitting there very quiet for a very, very, very long time. Any thoughts that you would like to share with the committee here on GAO's perspective? Ms. Hundrup. Thank you. I will try to make this quick. I could say a lot but let me be brief with regard to mobile medical units. I think we found in our work that they absolutely do have the potential to fill a lot of gaps but the information that is out there now, it suggests they are underperforming. I think just to underscore Dr. Elnahal, we really need better information so that we have a complete picture which will give us a better sense of where they can be more strategically used and fill a critical gap in care. I think just to very briefly say, I think really focusing on the information by rurality to understand what is happening and then take action to develop guidance to really just look at, we have talked a lot about women-specific issues, the needs of rural areas, tailoring that to the guidance to get that out to the field so that they can then take action. I could go on but I am going to stop there. Thank you. Mr. Bergman. No, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me an extra 30 seconds. The Chairman. All right. Before I dismiss the panel I have two really quick questions for Dr. Elnahal. Doctor, it is the committee's priority to ensure that VA provides the care our veterans deserve. Do you think the work environment at Loma Linda Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) is conducive to our veterans receiving the care that they deserve? Mr. Elnahal. Well, I heard concerns, Chairman, about the work environment at Loma Linda, which is why I visited myself. It was eye opening to hear directly from employees, labor leaders and, you know, the difficult experience that many of the employees had there and the behavior that we have seen from certain leaders in the past was not excusable. I will say that I think things, the culture there is beginning to improve. I intend to get an update soon from the director at Loma Linda but what I want to make sure that the whistleblowers know at Loma Linda and at every corner of our system is that we are here to listen to you and we take those concerns very seriously. I going to be personally tracking progress at Loma Linda. I was there with Representative Takano as well. The Chairman. Thank you. Also, in November 2023, the Secretary committed to providing the committee with a list of possible health conditions that could quality for VA's health exceptions for abortions. It has been 69 days since this commitment was given to me to get this communication. Will you give me the commitment? Will you provide that information as promised by January 19? Mr. Elnahal. Mr. Chairman, my commitment is to make sure you get that as soon as we possibly can. We took the questions very seriously in your latest letter and we want to make sure we provide the most precise and accurate response as possible for the record. The Chairman. All right. Well, thank you for being here, Doctor, and also Mr. Jacobs, Mr. Boerstler, and Ms. Handrup for testifying today. You are now excused. Thank you for being here. We want to try to get the second panel up and seated as quickly as possible. The second panel is seated. Welcome. I would like to welcome Ms. Marisa Schultz and Dr. Buu Nygren and Mr. John Lovald. Finally, Mark Holmes. Thank you for being here. We had another witnessed scheduled, Mr. Mikelson, John Mikelson, but in a vivid reminder of the challenges rural veterans face, his appearance here was stopped by a snowstorm. I would like to recognize myself if I may to introduce our first witness who I am proud to say is from my home district, Illinois 12. Ms. Marisa Schultz is a veteran who understands the issues on how to navigate the VA and is a tireless advocate for veterans. Marisa served in the Illinois National Guard and deployed to Iraq in 2005. When she got home she enrolled in classes at Eastern Illinois University and eventually took a job with the Salvation Army Supportive Services Veterans Families program where she is a healthcare navigator. It is my pleasure to have Marisa here today to bring her vitally important perspective to the table. Ms. Schultz, you are recognized for 5 minutes for your opening statement. STATEMENT OF MARISA SCHULTZ Ms. Schultz. Thank you, Chairman Bost, Ranking Member Takano, and members of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs for this opportunity. My name is Marisa Schultz. I am a disabled combat veteran and a healthcare advocate. I commend your dedication to our veterans and I am honored to represent the rural veteran community. I served in the Illinois National Guard, being deployed in 2004 through 2005. I have personal and professional experience utilizing health care in rural areas through the VA. Professionally, I serve veterans in rural communities identifying their needs and helping them access healthcare systems, community care, and other outside providers. As we convene today, I implore you to consider a group of heroes who often face an unnoticed battle, the veterans residing in rural America. As stewards of their well-being, it is imperative that we acknowledge the stark disparities between urban and rural healthcare access for our veterans. We owe it to them to level the playing field. Imagine being a veteran eagerly awaiting a VA arranged ride to a medical appointment, excited to get help dealing with chronic pain from a helicopter crash during employment. For one such veteran I served, lengthy wait times and repeated failures in VA transportation options led to desperation ending in a call to 988. This veteran suffered from emotional and physical distress and feeling like the system had failed him. This is not an isolated scenario. It is the reality for many of our rural veterans. Transportation, or rather lack thereof, emerges as a top barrier for our healthcare access. Financial constraints and employment vulnerabilities further compound this dilemma, forcing veterans to make agonizing choices between their health and their livelihoods. Moving on, to provide model health care to our veterans, we must acknowledge and address another critical issue, a need for gender-specific health care within the VA. Rural female veterans who served our country with equal valor encounter unique challenges in accessing specialized health care tailored to their needs. In my case, securing a female provider for a compensation and benefits examination necessitated a 2-hour commute. This challenge of meeting this basic, yet serious request reflects limited availability of practitioners in rural locations. A third critical issue is the advancement of telehealth which has a potential to break geographical barriers and provide unparalleled health care for our veterans. Telehealth offers a lifeline to veterans residing in remote areas often struggling with limited access to traditional healthcare facilities. It presents the opportunity to help ensure timely care reaches these underserved communities. While the flexibility of telehealth has significantly expanded accessibility, it has also brought some notable challenges. Elderly and aging populations encounter challenges with digital literacy hindering the seamless use of telehealth system. Limited phone minutes and need for internet access also present hurdles. Overall, significant progress has occurred in the past few years and we hope to see further improvements to telehealth options. We have explored some challenges our rural veterans face in accessing health care such as transportation options, access to gender-specific providers, and digital literacy for telehealth. One way to help rural veterans access care and meet them where they are can be done through the strategic deployment of mobile medical units which can be designed to provide primary care and other essential services. These could be deployed to areas lacking traditional healthcare access, effectively addressing the insufficient healthcare access for rural veterans. Additionally, emphasizing the pivotal role of technology, specifically telehealth, by expanding or creating digital education can help bridge this gap. To conclude, I urge this committee to consider critical issues faced by rural veterans, specifically transportation options, access to gender-specific providers, and digital literacy for telehealth. Let us work together to ensure that health care for our veterans it not determined by their geographical location. Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to positive outcomes that benefit our rural veterans.  The Chairman. Thank you very much for your testimony. For our next witness I yield to Mr. Crane to introduce the witness. Mr. Crane. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding today's hearing on an important topic and for your concern for rural and tribal veterans. I am glad your staff was able to experience firsthand the incredible Navajo veteran community in Tuba City this past August. I want to take a minute to welcome President Buu Nygren to the committee today. I visited President Nygren in Window Rock following his inauguration last year shortly after I kicked off my time here in Congress and appreciated learning more from him about the unique challenges Navajo veterans face in obtaining health care and other critical services. We met with former Navajo Nation chairman and code talker Peter MacDonald and I was grateful to hear his experience. I also joined President Nygren in welcoming VA Secretary McDonough to Tuba City last July. We appreciate the Secretary coming out to my district and meeting with our veterans. For those of you who do not know, I am proud to represent over half the tribes in Arizona including the Navajo Nation. My district spans 20,200 square miles of Arizona land. That is larger than nine U.S. states, and the rural and tribal areas I represent do not have reliable access to VA services. Native Americans historically have the highest record of military service per capital and Navajo veterans specifically have a rich history of service to our Nation. Navajo patriots serving as code talkers during World War II used traditional tribal languages to send secret messages in battle, a contribution that along with their warrior mentality was essential to our victory. Unfortunately, despite their remarkable impact on our military history and culture, Navajo veterans face many barriers to VA service and care. The VA hospitals in Phoenix and Albuquerque are the only full-service medical centers within driving distance to the Navajo Nation and veterans still face a 3-to 5-hour drive to get to those locations. I, myself, have made the drive from Tuba City to Phoenix, almost 4 hours of driving and that is just not feasible for a veteran needing frequent and reliable access to medical care. While several VA outpatient clinics have been established within Navajo Nation lands, these clinics often focus on primary care or less severe mental health issues. This means that many do not have the resources to address severe PTSD and they may also lack the ability to provide specialty care for chronic pain or diabetes. Two of the most common diagnoses among Navajo veterans. If they cannot reach a VA facility that is capable of providing the type of care they need, Navajo veterans suffer. This is unacceptable, and I hope that in this hearing today we can discuss ways to address this to ensure our tribal veterans can receive the care they need and deserve. I am looking forward to hearing President Nygren's perspective as he represents the voice of our Navajo veterans who have played an integral role in our military victories and continue to serve honorably today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Crane. Dr. Nygren, you are recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF BUU NYGREN Mr. Nygren. Yaateeh, Chairman Bost, Ranking Member Takano, and members of the committee, and our representative Eli Crane, thank you so much. My name is Dr. Buu Nygren. I serve as the president of the Navajo Nation. I come before you today to discuss critical and ongoing issues of access to care and benefits for our veterans all across the Navajo Nation, who have a proud history of military service. As many of you know, Native Americans have a profound and honored legacy with the United States military. Our warriors have served with distinction in every major conflict since World War I. During World War II, the Navajo Code Talkers created an unbreakable code from our Dine language that was instrumental in securing the victory for the Allies in the Pacific theater. Their valor and courage exemplify a patriotism and sacrifices that is a hallmark of our Navajo people. Despite this rich history, Navajo veterans face significant barriers in accessing the care and benefits they have earned. The closest VA Medical Center as mentioned earlier is in Phoenix, Arizona; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and Salt Lake City, Utah. The distances present a formidable obstacle often requiring veterans to travel many, many hours at great personal expense across remote areas just to receive basic services. This burden is compounded by social determinants of health that disproportionately affects our community such as high rates of poverty, unemployment, and limited access to transportation. Telehealth services, which is beneficial, are not a cure all for our veterans. The digital divide is a stark reality on the Navajo Nation where many of our veterans lack adequate internet access or the technology needed to utilize telehealth effectively. The limitation is not just a matter of convenience but a barrier to essential health care, mental health services, and benefit assistance. The VA's Beneficiary Travel program is critical, yet it does not fully offset the high costs of the logistical challenges associated with traveling many, many hours to the VA facilities. Furthermore, grant and per diem rates for homelessness of veterans do not reflect the higher cost of living in remote areas which further disadvantage our veterans in need. Access to healthcare providers is another significant challenge. There is a scarcity of medical professionals in our region and their shortage means that even basic care can be very hard to come by. Compensation and pension exams which are crucial for veterans seeking disabilities and benefits are often delayed or inaccessible due to this lack. The issues I have outlined today represent a larger problem. The lack of adequate VA care on the Navajo Nation is not reflective of the continuous contributions the Navajo people have provided this country. Our veterans have earned the right to accessible, quality care, and benefits through their service and sacrifice. It is for these reasons I ask Congress to work with my administration to bring a full-service VA Medical Center into the Navajo Nation. This center would provide quality care not only for our Navajo veterans but most of the rural southwestern part of the United States. I am also asking Congress to appropriate funds to build a VA benefit center on the in New Mexico side of the Nation to help educate our veterans on the benefits that they have earned together through their service. In closing, I urge the committee and Congress to take a decisive action to address these critical issues facing our Navajo veterans. We need increased funding aimed specifically at improving infrastructure and services in rural areas tailored to the unique challenges of our Nation and the region. We must bridge the digital divide to ensure telehealth is a viable option for our veterans. It is essential to address grant and per diem rates that reflect the true cost of living in remote areas and to expand the beneficial travel program to alleviate the significant financial burdens our veterans undertake. Our Navajo veterans have honored their commitments to our Nation. We must continue to honor them by bringing services closer to them. Thank you for your time and consideration. Thank you.  The Chairman. Thank you, Doctor. Next we have Mr. Jon Lovald, Chief Operations Officer for the Minnesota Assistant Council for Veterans. Mr. Lovald, you are recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF JON LOVALD Mr. Lovald. Thank you, Chairman Bost, Ranking Member Takano, committee members. My name is Jon Lovald and I am the Chief Operating Officer for the Minnesota Assistance Council for Veterans. I grew up in rural Minnesota, and before joining MACV I served for 25 years in the Army retiring as a lieutenant colonel. MACV is a 501(c)(3) statewide nonprofit with the mission to end veteran homelessness in Minnesota. MACV served more than 2,000 veterans and their families last year with roughly half of those veterans residing in rural and other nonurban areas across Minnesota. I thank you for this opportunity to share the observations and experiences our organization has gleaned from decades spent serving thousands of veterans in greater Minnesota. The challenges and opportunities facing rural veterans can vary considerably depending on where they reside. Combined with their individual backgrounds and needs, the most effective way to serve these veterans might look different than what is available to the urban veteran. Some of rural veterans' most consistent barriers include lack of affordable housing, few jobs which pay a living wage, transportation limitations, scarcity of support of services, and many rural communities simply have no emergency shelter. MACV's team regularly encounters these challenges while serving rural veterans as finding housing, employment, transportation, and short-term shelter are all interconnected and determine their stability. For example, we have Ryan, a 66-year-old Coast Guard veteran from Winona, Minnesota, with an honorable discharge. Served 4 years on the Coast Guard cutter Steadfast. Last year's housing stability was challenged after he lost his wife and he was struggling to care for himself while he was grieving. He was hospitalized with a life-threatening infection that needed a partial amputation of his foot. During those months he was in the hospital he fell several months behind on rent, and additionally during that time a family member who was staying in his house was arrested triggering the landlord to evict Ryan leaving him homeless upon his discharge from the hospital. Luckily, the small town of Winona has a shelter and staff there realized Ryan was a veteran and they connected him with MACV services. Due to his medical situation, it was untenable for him to stay in the shelter, but MACV was able to place him into a hotel room using a state-funded emergency shelter program. MACV was able to then help him search for his sustainable housing solution to fit his needs. Through our landlord partnerships, we were able to find Ryan accessible housing designed for veterans. Thankfully, this location has an accessible transportation program as well since he does not drive. This all sounds like a great assist. However, all these resources required him to move miles away from his hometown of Winona to Rochester. While he is currently housed, he would prefer to live where he still has family and a support system but there are no options for a veteran with his limitations in a smaller town. Jerome, a 27-year-old Army veteran living in Olivia, Minnesota, was staying with family after his discharge from the military. He had a fallout with family forcing him to leave. Due to the fact that there is not emergency shelter in his community, he started living out of his car in a campground. He could afford to pay for the camp fees because he was employed and he stayed there to be able to take showers and maintain his outward appearance to ensure he could keep his job. However, with winter looming, the campground would be closed for the season. Thankfully, in Minnesota, every county in the state is required to have either a county veteran service officer (CVSO) or a tribal veteran service officer. His CVSO connected Jerome to MACV and we were able to supply him a cell phone through the VA's Homeless Smartphone Initiative. That helped us stay in contact with him even though he was homeless and miles from our closest office. Through that connection we were able to work with him to find housing near his job in Redwood Falls, then using Supportive Services for Veterans Families (SSVF) funds to help him with his deposit and first month's rent. I mentioned that the VA's Smartphone Initiative ended in 2023. This was a program that greatly helped rural veterans with limited access to the internet. In every case where we end a veteran's homelessness is done through a network of collaborative efforts involving Federal VA, state, local, and nonprofit agencies working together to find the best outcome possible. There are many resources for veterans but most of them tend to be in larger towns or metropolitan areas with limited affordable housing options due to their desired locations. Rural housing, while it can be affordable, rarely has access to homeless resources, jobs with livable wages, and no access to public transportation for rural veterans to reach critical resources. I am pleased to report to you today that Minnesota has achieved a functional end to veteran homelessness in 8 of our 10 continuums of care, including all of our COCs in rural Minnesota through our partnerships. Thank you for the chance today to speak on serving rural veterans.  The Chairman. Thank you for your testimony. Next we have Dr. Mark Holmes. He is a director of the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Science Research and North Carolina Rural Health Research Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Dr. Holmes, you are recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF MARK HOLMES Mr. Holmes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon. My name is Mark Holmes. I am the director of the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research and the North Carolina Rural Health Research Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am an economist whose expertise is in rural health policy. For today's hearing, I will provide context on challenges facing the non-VHA rural healthcare system. Rural veterans may receive some or much of their health care from community providers, so it is important to recognize the fragility of the overall rural healthcare system as part of their healthcare portfolio. I am unable to cover all the salient topics in rural health today so I will focus my comments on three main points relevant to today's topic. The first is that rural healthcare infrastructures continue to erode and this threatens the health and well-being of the 60,000,000 Americans, including the 5,000,000 veterans who live in rural areas. Two, Congress should consider some effective rural health workforce policies. Third is that many rural communities have also shown remarkable ability to innovate and use their strength and local assets to overcome challenge. Since 2005, nearly 200 rural communities have seen their hospital close or close its inpatient service. Those hospitals that do survive have steadily gotten smaller. Rural hospitals have cut services like maternity care and home health services and inpatient care in rural hospitals has fallen by 13 to 20 percent in the last decade alone with most of the decreases driven by rural residents being increasingly likely to receive inpatient care at urban hospitals. Access to specialty care is also affected. Approximately 20 percent of Americans live more than 60 minutes from oncology services and rural residents who have to drive an hour each way for 5 weeks in a row to get their radiation treatment are facing fatigue of long car travel while fighting cancer. Meanwhile, many specialty services including maternity, surgical, and other key specialties are eroding in rural areas. Given evidence that female veterans may be more dependent on non-VHA providers to receive certain gender specific services like obstetric and gynecologic care, the erosion of these services in rural communities is especially worrisome for this population. Rural places have long faced workforce shortages. Many proposed policy solutions to address these workforce challenges focus on one profession at one stage in their career and it is critical that we look at solutions that are not siloed in this fashion and support healthcare workers across their entire career trajectory. Decades of research have taught us that one of the most effective ways to boost health workforce in rural and underserved areas is to train them in rural and underserved areas. By growing the number of rural training opportunities and ensuring that resources are available to retain that workforce across their careers, we can ensure that the workforce needed to support rural areas is there for decades to come. Efforts to expand physician training have paid great dividends. For example, Rural Residency Planning and Development program has helped lead to more rural residency slots in the last 5 years than were established during the previous decade. By supporting residency program development, Congress can increase the number of slots in underserved communities which improves access to health care. As you all know, the Choice Act directed and funded the VHA to increase the number of residency slots by 1,500 with many rural VHA facilities receiving priority for additional slots. Additionally, the VA's GME pilot program on Graduate Medical Education residency will allow the VA to fund startup costs for new programs that train VA residents at non-VHA facilities. This is a new approach for the VHA and will help bolster their ability to train residents at facilities where many veterans seek care. Congress could consider whether to expand this model to train additional types of health professions beyond physicians. Veterans would benefit from health professionals who are trained and practice on interprofessional teams both in VHA and non-VHA facilities. Behavioral health is a particularly salient healthcare service for veterans. Veterans experience certain conditions like Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and substance use disorders more often than their civilian counterparts. Although access to behavioral health care remains a crisis throughout the country, compared to urban residents rural residents receive less care from providers with less specialized training, and the care they receive is less likely to be innovative. This creates a particularly acute challenge for rural veterans. There are fewer healthcare providers to treat and manage their more prevalent behavioral health needs. Perhaps because of the more limited resources in rural communities there are many examples where rural healthcare innovations led the way. It is important to continue to recognize that rural healthcare systems are different and not simply small versions of urban and can yield similar outcomes when given the opportunity. One word of caution as we talked a lot about telehealth today and we have heard about one-quarter of rural veterans not having internet in their home, and we cannot have systems that are built on veterans connecting with their providers in the parking lot of a library. Although rural residents and those who visit rural communities face real barriers to achieving their full health potential, history has shown that thoughtful legislation designed to address rural-specific challenges and leverage the assets of rural American has been successful in improving the lives of those who live in our rural communities. Thank you.  The Chairman. Thank you. Now we are going to go to questions. I will recognize myself for 5 minutes. Ms. Schultz, how is it different for a homeless veteran in rural Illinois than it is in Chicago or other major cities? Ms. Schultz. Thank you for your question. In rural communities for homelessness veterans you lack no public transportation. I mean, there is no public transportation. The access to everything is impossible, really. If you do not live in a community where you have access to more jobs, apartments, all the things, even healthcare access, VA care, it is just very different. It is night and day really. The Chairman. As far as the actual homeless veterans, there are a lot more urban programs than for rural homeless veterans to try to find anything? Ms. Schultz. I believe for urban homeless veterans you have more resources. You have clothing banks. You have food pantries. We have those things in rural areas. They are just more widespread and harder to get to. The Chairman. In your opinion, what can VA do to help make sure rural homeless veterans are treated equally to those ones in the urban areas? Ms. Schultz. Just expanding healthcare access programs to support them. I mean, things need to be more readily available. The Chairman. Okay. Mr. Lovald, H.R. 3848 and the Housing Oversight and Mitigating Exploration (HOME) Act that passed the House late last year would include authority for VA to provide similar assistance with rides of appointments for homeless veterans. Would this additional authority alleviate some of the strain on the MACV and the other providers seeking to help the homeless veterans? Mr. Lovald. Chairman Bost, thank you for that question. That absolutely could assist in the process of us connecting with those veterans. I think that one thing I would highlight, in the state of Minnesota, the Disabled American Veterans (DAV), in partnership with the VA, provides numerous rides. Currently those rides very specifically have to be related to VA health care. If there was an expansion on where those vehicles could be used for or another way to access transportation that did not require the veterans to have a vehicle, many of them cannot, many of them are not driving anymore, anything that addresses exactly what was just discussed about getting said veteran to that resource is going to be helpful. The Chairman. Well, first off, I want to say thank you to each one of the panelists because I am going to turn it over to Mr. Takano for his questions. Let me say this. When you come from areas that are rural like I do--I know many of the people on this committee do--any unique ways that you can see to help us help VA to make sure that they can provide those services. You know, when we started talking about telehealth everybody thought how great it is. It is true for the rural area. It handles great for the rural area if you have a connection. Quite often we have watched in the rural areas getting a connection might even be easier than getting potable water, too, but that is a whole different story for the rural areas. It is unique, and I appreciate you being here. I will now turn it over to Ranking Member Takano for questions. Mr. Takano. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Nygren, thank you. Dr. Nygren, thank you so much for being here. I had the pleasure of visiting Window Rock in 2022. In your testimony you advocate for Congress to appropriate funds to build a full-service VA Medical Center in the Navajo Nation. Who do you envision this facility serving? Just veterans or all Navajo Nation citizens? Mr. Nygren. Thank you, Honorable Takano, for coming out last year. I just missed you just by a few months. Hopefully you come back out. Mr. Takano. I would love to. It is a beautiful country. I would love to be the guest of Representative Crane. Mr. Nygren. All right. Well, thank you to both of you. The first thing I think about is I think it is going to serve all veterans in the area. I think that not only it would benefit Navajo veterans. It would benefit Hopi veterans, Ute veterans and non-Native American veterans just because it would be a lot closer to the Four Corners area because we are in such a unique, beautiful area that if that facility was actually built in Chinle, Arizona it would actually bring a lot more people closer to where their travel distances are not as far. I do know that most of our Navajo citizens do use Indian Health Services to the best of their abilities but I do know if this facility is built it would really benefit the 10,000 plus Navajo veterans and probably a lot more that have not really realized some of their benefits that are available. Mr. Takano. Well, have we given thought to a possible joint facility with VA and the IHS so that your people could benefit from the economy of scale to bring out specialists, to make it a real, a much fuller array of services. We could justify that by opening it up to both the IHS beneficiaries as well as VA beneficiaries. Is that an idea you are open to? Mr. Nygren. I think, Mr. Takano, I think that would be a great idea. I know that one of the things that currently we are going to reopen a small contract agreement with the Chinle IHS, but most of the concerns of the veterans is they want to be treated more tailored as if they showed up at a VA center instead of being just treated like a normal Native American going to that facility. That was one of the things that I have been told is let us make sure they treat us like veterans instead of them not even asking us if we are a veteran or not. Mr. Takano. I think that is a very valid concern. I think just knowing that it is primarily a VA facility but there has historically been this connection between the IHS and VA. I hope to talk to Representative Crane more about this idea because I believe as far as directing resources to a major facility, this is one way to maybe get it done. I was impressed by the fact that you have your own college and that you have a nursing program is what I recall. Of course, as Dr. Holmes has mentioned, one of the best ways to get health practitioners into rural areas is to get medical residencies and training opportunities into these areas. I have Sherman Indian Institute, which many of your young people come to in Riverside, California. Do you think there might be ways for us to work together to create pipelines of training opportunities for students to come to Sherman, students that go to your own schools and to your own college to train for these medical professions? Mr. Nygren. Honorable Takano, I think that is a great idea. I think that one of the things that we really need within that area is trying to develop that pipeline of nurses that are local so that people are not crisscrossing across the country to take on contracts for a few weeks at a time because what will happen is you will have people that come out for short stints of time but they do not truly understand the culture. They do not understand the people. If we can train up our own people, whether they go to the program at Sherman Indian School--just so you know, my grandma went to Sherman a long time ago. One time I was there and she showed me a picture of where they would pick up dates and stuff and things like that. I know it is a long way from Navajo but it is one of those site topics to where I think that I cannot believe people traveled that far back in the 1940's and the 1950's so far away from home. I am definitely open to what we can do with the Sherman Institute and our own school. I know that Northern Arizona University is working on developing a medical school, and I think that is something that Representative Crane and myself and you, we can talk with Northern Arizona University to figure out is there a program that can be geared toward Navajo nurses and doctors and be a lot closer to Navajo. Mr. Takano. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, if you might permit me to ask just ask one question of Dr. Holmes. Thank you for being here, Dr. Holmes. You know, you talk about other ways that VA and healthcare systems could attract and retain mid-and later-career professionals in rural areas. Can you point to any success stories about how that has already happened or could happen? Mr. Holmes. Thank you for the question. I think one of the themes that I have heard all day and at this panel as well is the notion that rural communities need to design programs that are tailored to the assets that are there. If some communities have really strong broadband then that might be a solution there. Others may have a scope of practice that enables. I am getting to your answer, I promise. All that is to say that healthcare systems are often really innovative at this and they recognize what it is that they need in order to keep their mid-and late-career professionals. Part of that is a career ladder. Particularly in rural areas, you need to be able to see I have progress in my career and I can move forward. Investments in those kinds of models have proven highly effective where a medical assistant can become a nurse and expand their career over time. Mr. Takano. Thank you. We have a tremendous brain trust here and I hope that we can make some movement on rural healthcare. I yield back. The Chairman. Representative Radewagen. Ms. Radewagen. Ms. Schultz, can you describe the specific challenges you face in accessing healthcare services in your rural area such as transportation or distance to the nearest VA facilities? How have these challenges affected your ability to receive timely and adequate health care, especially for any ongoing or specialized medical needs? Ms. Schultz. Okay. Thank you for the question. My closest VA hospital is 2 hours from me but I do have the privilege of having a Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) in my town. If I cannot go to the 2 hours then I can get care locally. When we dive into Community Care, because not everything is available at a CBOC, I still have to travel. I have one Community Care. I still have to travel an hour and 15 minutes to get to a Community Care provider because it is so hard to get into the Community Care system and it is a rural area so not as many providers are available for Community Care. I have had personal difficulty getting referrals to specialists so I use my private insurance to do those things which, again, I am blessed to be able to do. I work with veterans who do not have those same privileges and they miss appointments because of VA options for transportation or there is no options for transportation or they are working. A lot of veterans who I work with have to choose between going to work, and they do not have the kinds of jobs that allow them time off for medical appointments. They do not have Paid Time Off (PTO) so they do not have that access to care readily available. As far as female providers, again, for specialized female care I would have to travel 2 hours to get to the facility for that care. Ms. Radewagen. In your testimony you mentioned mobile medical units. What has your experience been like in regards to receiving health care at mobile medical units? Have they provided you with adequate care and met all your needs? Ms. Schultz. I do not have any personal experience with mobile medical units. I just do not want to bring problems without solutions and I feel like mobile medical units coming into rural areas would be beneficial for our veterans who do not have transportation, or if they have transportation it is only getting them locally, right, to their basic needs, to their job. I did a little research with the mobile medical units that were deployed starting in August 2023 and it appeared to me that they were really in urban areas. Refocusing some of those units or getting additional units into rural areas could really be a gamechanger. Ms. Radewagen. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. Schultz. Thank you. The Chairman. General Bergman. Mr. Bergman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for being here. Mr. Lovald, I am sure you are familiar with Scott County. My dad, a World War II vet's last community service was driving veterans from around Scott County into the VA Medical Center over by the airport. It was one of the proudest moments of his life, especially it was not about so much getting them to the appointment, which was essential but the interaction that he had with them as some old guys who have been around a long time sharing stories toward the end of life, if you will. I thank you for all you do across the state of Minnesota. Dr. Nygren, I greatly appreciate you being here and providing the testimony. Michigan's 1st District which I represent is home to seven federally recognized tribes. All are in rural and remote areas and all with a long history of service to our country in uniform. Some of my most heartwarming, fulfilling interactions over these last 7 years in Congress is to attend the different tribal ceremonies at different times of the year to dance and participate in the ceremonies because we are all thankful for everybody's service over time. One of the recommendations in your testimony is to foster collaboration between Congress, the VA, tribal leaders, and tribal health authorities. I am going to ask one question and just say any steps that you think you would like to take, next steps you would like to take to accomplish this. Is part of this the potential for utilization of excess space in tribal health clinics that are rural and remote that here you have the existing tribal health clinic and you have space, is there an opportunity for us to deliver some of that rural and remote care? Veterans are not driving by the tribal health clinic because they are not a member of the tribe. I would just like to hear your thoughts on that. Mr. Nygren. Thank you, Congressman Bergman. I thank you for the tribes that you represent, the seven tribes, and I am very happy that you are open to being a part of their traditions and cultures as my representative is, too, as well. Thank you so much. I think this question also kind of comes back to Mr. Takano's question as well, too, is what can we do to better utilize? All of us know that any healthcare facility in rural America, if we can find a way to collaborate and bring them together to work with the VA is good for all of us because it is already tough enough to get water, electricity, and sewer. If there is a tribal health facility that is there, my recommendation would be to continue that collaboration so that veterans feel like when they walk in--not only when they walk into that tribal facility, but if a part of it is dedicated to them so that they understand that a veteran is going to be talking to me. They know the challenges that they have gone through and things like that. I believe that if we can continue to foster that spirit of collaboration to figure out how can we combine the VA and the tribal facilities to work together so the veteran does show up, I think that will definitely work a lot easier. It actually would make it a lot more feasible because I know there are times when it is a tremendous task to bring a facility out to any remote rural areas but if you can already tap into the existing infrastructures that are there to kind of build off of I think that will be a great way to start those discussions as well. Mr. Bergman. Well, when you think about it certain things that are done, procedures performed, pharmacies potentially, whatever it happens to be, the idea of shared services, you already have a physical facility. How do we get maximum utilization out of that for all concerned? I just want to thank you all for being here and I will yield back 30 seconds here for the good of the order. Thank you all. The Chairman. Representative Crane, you are recognized. Mr. Crane. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. President Nygren, thank you again for being here today, sir. Thank you for everything you do for the Navajo Nation. It is definitely critical for us to hear your perspective on these issues. As we previously discussed, Navajo veterans face extremely lengthy trips to VA health centers, often driving multiple hours just for one health visit. At some clinical locations they may not even be able to get that type of specialty care. In your opinion, what is the greatest barrier to care for Navajo veterans? Mr. Nygren. Thank you, Representative Crane. The greatest one that I think about is the distances that they travel. If you have ever been to Navajo country it is very--as we are speaking now, there is big weather that is coming through and elders are stuck in communities to where even it is hard to get a grader or a backhoe in some of those communities. It is one of those things where I think about where if we can bring the services a lot closer to them and more accessible that would actually make it a lot easier on them because for them to travel down to Phoenix, they have told us that the mileage reimbursement is enough to just cover the gas but it does not account for the vehicles that they drive because a lot of the vehicles that they drive are 4-by-4 vehicles because of the rural areas that 9 miles a gallon is only going to get you so far when you go down to Phoenix. Those are some of the challenges. The other challenge is that a lot of these veterans are elderly. They are either Vietnam veterans or they are in that age where it is very difficult for them to travel. They are going to have to have people to actually take them down there. To me one of the greatest challenges would be to bring it a lot closer to them. Mr. Crane. Absolutely. Now, we talked about a possible VA hospital, improving telehealth reliability, adjusting per diem rates to relieve costly financial burdens. Is there anything else on that list that we can do to help veterans on the Navajo Nation? Mr. Nygren. Honorable Representative Crane, when it comes to telehealth, as everyone mentioned here, when we talk telehealth for rural communities it all depends on the services that we can actually get to actually get videoconferencing. Our veterans on Navajo, they actually really prefer people to deal with because a lot of them only speak Navajo. They do not quite understand a lot of the challenges that a lot of people can use a telephone. A lot of them do not prefer that. They really prefer in-person discussions, one-on-one discussions and to be able to relate to someone. I think that might be another obstacle really to think about when it comes to telehealth is just there is that generation that would really prefer in- person meetings instead of telehealth. Mr. Crane. Absolutely. If you had to rank those three priorities--the hospital, telehealth, and then adjusting per diem rates, would it go in that order, one, two, and three, just like that? Mr. Nygren. Yep. They would be very close to one another. Mr. Crane. Okay. Thank you, President Nygren, for being here today. One question for Mr. Lavold real quick. Sir, I know your big issue is veteran homelessness. I know there are several reasons that our veterans end up homeless. What is the biggest reason that you tend to see our veterans becoming homeless? Mr. Lovald. Representative Crane, thank you for that question. As it relates to rural veterans specifically or just veterans in general, veterans who are finding their selves homeless have essentially run out of resources. They have maybe burned bridges. They have run out of family. They have run out of places that they can actually go before they are actually homeless. There rarely is somebody waking up and the next day they are homeless. We have seen and witnessed that a lot of mental health issues are what are contributing to decision-making that then lends into difficult situations with their family or friends. Maybe creating incarceration situations as well. The mental health component I think is a very big piece of why an individual becomes homeless and honestly, why some veterans choose to be homeless is because they are not connected to the mental health services that they might need to help them see a solution in front of them that is viable. Mr. Crane. Yes. That is something a lot of people do not understand that some veterans actually do choose that lifestyle at least for a period of time; is that correct? Mr. Lovald. That absolutely is correct. We continue to reach out to these individuals with different solutions hoping that the next opportunity, maybe we built that relationship to offer something new. Mr. Crane. Thank you, Mr. Lavold. I yield back. The Chairman. Thank you. Ranking member, do you have any--first of all, I want to say thank you to the panel here, but do you have any closing remarks? Mr. Takano. No. We have got to go vote. I appreciate the courtesy in letting me ask Dr. Holmes more questions. The Chairman. I want to say thank you to the ranking member. I want to thank all the witnesses for joining us here today, especially the second panel who traveled from all over from rural America to try to get here today and provided access to the best healthcare benefits and veterans. As I asked earlier, if you come up with ideas, please bring them to us, any suggestions you may have. We want to make sure that we do this and we want to make sure that our veterans are provided for no matter where they live and where they choose to live. I appreciate Ranking Member Takano and the members of the Committee for standing shoulder to shoulder with me in a bipartisan manner to do that. I ask unanimous consent that all members shall have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material. Hearing no objection, so ordered. This hearing is now adjourned.  ======================================================================= A P P E N D I X ======================================================================= Prepared Statement of Witnesses ---------- Prepared Statement of Shereef Elnahal Chairman Bost, Ranking Member Takano, and Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the ways VA provides health care and benefits to Veterans in rural or highly rural areas.\1\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ Veterans Health Administration uses the Rural-Urban Commuting Areas system to define rurality. The Rural-Urban Commuting Areas system considers population density as well as how closely a community is linked socio-economically to larger urban centers. We use the term rural to include rural, highly rural, and insular island areas. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Almost a quarter of all Veterans, more than 4.4 million reside in rural communities. Many of these Veterans face unique challenges and obstacles that differ widely from their urban counterparts. Veterans often reside in rural communities to be close to family, friends, and community; to have open spaces for recreation; more privacy; lower cost of living; and less crowded towns and schools. However, the geographical isolation of rural areas can create challenges for rural Veterans in accessing VA resources, including medical care, educational benefits, and employment assistance. Rural Veterans often face unreliable internet access, long travel distances, and less awareness about the benefits and care available to them through VA. Unreliable internet access restricts their ability to connect with online platforms and information, limiting access to essential resources like telehealth services and online application processes. Long travel distances can also pose financial and logistical challenges for rural Veterans, who must travel considerable distances to receive medical care, appointments, or other essential services. Furthermore, historically limited outreach efforts in rural communities may prevent many Veterans from fully utilizing the resources to which they are entitled. VA is committed to working across Government, including with Congress, the White House, and Executive branch, and with Veterans, and external stakeholders to overcome these challenges and provide rural Veterans with the care and benefits they have earned and deserve. The Department is doing so through new efforts under the Biden-Harris Administration and through ongoing efforts across the agency. President Biden's Policies Benefit Rural Veterans The Biden-Harris Administration's general policy framework has provided more care and benefits to Veterans, including rural Veterans. The Administration emphasizes expanding access to quality health care services, including mental health and substance use disorder resources, through initiatives like telehealth and mobile clinics. The framework aims to address long travel distances and limited access to medical facilities experienced by rural Veterans and to increase awareness of benefits and care available to these Veterans through outreach efforts and improved communication channels. By prioritizing rural Veterans' needs and improving their access to care, the President, and VA, aim to improve their quality of life and overall well-being. The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act \2\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \2\ Pub. L. No. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022). The PACT Act marked the largest expansion of Veteran benefits in a generation. From August 2022 to mid-December 2023, VA enrolled more than 500,000 new Veterans, over 100,000 of which were eligible to enroll based on specific new authorities in of the Act itself, and included 25,000 rural Veterans. To date, VA has also screened over five million Veterans enrolled in VA health care for toxic exposures, of which 1.7 million live in rural areas. This marks significant progress toward our goal of screening all Veterans enrolled in VA health care for toxic exposures at least once every five years. Rural Recruitment and Hiring Efforts. Department recruitment efforts for physicians and health care providers in rural regions have been a longstanding challenge. In fiscal year (FY) 2022, turnover rates within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) hit their highest levels in over 20 years, reaching 11 percent for VHA overall and 12.1 percent in rural facilities. In FY 2023, the PACT Act provided VA with unprecedented authority and flexibility to better recruit and retain staff. Leveraging these and other authorities, VHA saw a 7.4 percent overall growth rate and 7.7 percent in rural facilities for health care providers, the highest rate in over 15 years. Despite the fact that rural hiring outpaced the enterprise's overall growth, physicians remain more difficult to recruit in rural areas in particular. In FY 2023, rural areas saw a 2.1 percent growth rate in physicians, compared to 3.6 percent for VHA overall. VA continues to work with Congress to strengthen VA's ability to recruit and retain providers in high-need areas and specialties. As part of PACT Act implementation, VA has also developed the FY 2023 Rural Recruitment and Hiring Plan \3\ to ensure VA has the workforce it needs to meet our obligation to rural Veterans. The plan outlined goals to improve staffing levels at all rural facilities, engage stakeholders to improve recruitment and onboarding, empower leadership across rural facilities to implement comprehensive strategies, increase satisfaction with the recruitment, hiring, and onboarding process, and provide the soonest and best care to Veterans living in rural communities. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \3\ Veterans Health Administration. (2023). Rural Recruitment and Hiring Plan. Workforce Management & Consulting, in partnership with the Office of Rural Health. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Beyond efforts under the PACT Act, the Integrated Clinical Staffing Project contract, announced last year, is designed to address staffing shortages and improve care for Veterans.\4\ It covers various clinical and non-clinical positions, including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, therapists, technicians, social workers, and administrative staff. The contract will support VA's transformation initiatives, including the expansion of telehealth services and the enhancement of community care partnerships. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \4\ Note: The tentative award date for acquisition is January 9, 2024. No awardees have been named to date. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Largest Outreach Campaign in VA's History. With the passage of the PACT Act, VA launched its largest outreach campaign to ensure every Veteran impacted by toxic exposures receives the benefits and care they deserve. This required collaboration with community and national partners to reach Veterans across the country, especially rural Veterans, like never before. To this end, VA pushed an agency-wide enterprise initiative called ``Summer Vet Fest,'' intended to inform Veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors about the PACT Act and encourage them to apply for due benefits and care. Additionally, in the last calendar year, VA led at least two community-level events in every state and Puerto Rico and participated in 14,036 PACT Act-focused events, reaching 1,129,916 people. Of these PACT Act briefings, 5,883 included Congressional representation, and 32,248 included the media. VA also held 436 claims clinics across the country, reaching more than 18,000 attendees and resulting in 13,172 claims filed. Veterans Exposure Team-Health Outcomes Military Exposures (VET- HOME). The VET-HOME program \5\ is a vital initiative aimed at addressing the health concerns of Veterans, with an emphasis on military exposures, such as hazardous chemicals or environmental toxins, to identify and mitigate potential health risks. Launching over the past year, the program offers clinical evaluations on a national scale through a geographically distributed team of providers trained in military environmental exposures. This initiative is particularly important for rural Veterans who may have limited access to health care resources and face challenges in receiving timely and specialized care. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \5\ For more information, see https://www.publichealth.va.gov/VET- HOME/index.asp. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Caregiver Support Caregivers can play a crucial role in the well-being and quality of life of rural Veterans, especially those with physical or mental health challenges. In rural areas with limited health care and support resources, caregivers play a vital role in filling gaps and providing necessary support. They assist with medication management, transportation to appointments, and ensuring treatment plan adherence, leading to better health outcomes. Caregivers also positively impact the mental and emotional well-being of rural Veterans,\6\ providing emotional support, a listening ear, and a safe space for them to express their feelings. They also help alleviate social isolation, providing companionship, engagement in social activities, and connecting Veterans with support networks. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \6\ L'Heureux T, Parmar J, Dobbs B, Charles L, Tian PGJ, Sacrey LA, Anderson S.

See also Talley R., Crews J., Caring for the Most Vulnerable: Framing the Public Health of Caregiving. Am J Public Health. 2007;97:224-228. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In April 2023, President Biden signed an executive order to increase access to high-quality care and supporting caregivers,\7\ enabling families, including Veteran families, to have access to affordable, high-quality care and to have support and resources as caregivers themselves. As of December 19, 2023, 19,200 active caregivers in rural areas are enrolled in the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers, offering services and benefits. This Executive Order called for the expansion of the Veteran Directed Care program to all VA Medical Centers by the end of 2024. VA's Veteran Directed Care Program (VDC) provided personal care services to over 7,200 Veterans in FY 2023, with over 50 percent living in rural areas. VDC is crucial due to limited home health aide agencies and labor market shortages. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \7\ See generally https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/ Presidential-actions/2023/04/18/executive-order-on-increasing-access- to-high-quality-care-and-supporting-caregivers/. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Food Security Another significant health concern for rural Veterans, especially those who are younger, unmarried, unemployed, and have children is food security.\8\ Veterans who are food insecure are more likely to experience physical and mental health problems and have a fourfold higher risk of suicidal ideation. In 2022, VA established the VHA Food Security Office to address food insecurity among Veterans through partnerships, data management, and research. The office provides clinical nutrition care to many rural Veterans through tele-nutrition visits and VA Video Connect. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \8\ See Widome R, Jensen A, Bangerter A, Fu SS. Food insecurity among Veterans of the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Public Health Nutrition. 2015;18(5):844-849. doi:10.1017/S136898001400072X.

Public Health Reports. 2015;130(3):261- 268. doi:10.1177/003335491513000313. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- American Indian and Alaska Native Veteran Initiatives Meeting the needs of rural Veterans also means ensuring American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) Veterans receive the care and benefits they deserve. These Veterans serve in the military at one of the highest rates of all racial and ethnic groups and are the most likely to live in rural communities. These veterans' already significant health care disparities are aggravated by barriers related to access to care, coordination, and care navigation. Thus, VA has worked with its partners to develop programming to address these challenges. Copayment Exemption for American Indian/Alaska Native Veterans. In April 2023, VA implemented the Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020 \9\, exempting eligible Native Veterans from copayments for VA health care. The copayment exemption honors our treaties with sovereign Nations, addresses health care access and disparities, provides more health care options, and continues to build trust in VA. As of December 8, 2023, VA has canceled over 118,000 copayments for over 3,400 eligible AI/AN Veterans, amounting to $2.1 million in canceled and reimbursed copayments. VA continues to receive, review, and process applications for exemption and conduct outreach to ensure qualified Veterans get this exemption. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \9\ Pub. L. No. 116-315, 134 Stat. 4932 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tribal-VHA Collaboration on Suicide Prevention. In 2021, the highest suicide rate within minority populations was found amongst AI/ AN Veterans. VA is focusing on increasing access to care, delivering culturally meaningful treatments, and growing support networks to reduce suicide risk among these Veteran groups through a suicide prevention strategy that is guided by the National Strategy for Preventing Veteran Suicide 2018-2028 and aligns with the President's 2021 National Strategy for Reducing Military and Veteran Suicide. To this end, VA continues to collaborate with Federal, tribal, state, and local governments to advance a public health approach to suicide prevention. These efforts include: Advancing suicide prevention for Rural Native Veterans through Tribal-VHA partnerships; Implementing Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Outreach to Minority Veterans and American Indian and Alaska Native Veterans (P.L. 117-328 Sec. 101); Awarding $52.5 million to 80 community-based organizations through the Staff Sergeant Parker Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention Grant Program; and Expanding collaborative suicide prevention efforts with AI/AN tribal communities in FY 2024 as part of VA and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) Governor's Challenge to Prevent Suicide Among Service Members, Veterans, and their Families. COMPACT Act The Biden-Harris Administration recognizes that reducing suicide cannot be accomplished singularly through reactive policy change; rather, it requires a long-term strategic vision and commitment to implement systemic changes in how we support Service members, Veterans, and their families across the full continuum of risk and wellness. In addition to continuing to build on VA's public health approach to suicide prevention, this year, VA implemented section 201 of the Veterans Comprehensive, Access to Care and Treatment Act of 2020 (COMPACT) \10\ Act. This law enables VA to provide, pay for, or reimburse emergent suicide care for eligible Veterans, determine eligibility for other VA programs and benefits, and make appropriate referrals for care. The ability to be seen at any medical facility for this care without prior authorization can be critical for rural Veterans who may have to travel long distances to their nearest facility. In addition, rural Veterans in crisis now have simpler access to the Veterans Crisis Line. The National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline's new number--988 (then Press 1 for Veterans)--helps make it easier to remember and share the number to access help in times of need, regardless of location. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \10\ Pub. L. No. 116-214, 134 Stat. 1026. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ongoing Efforts to Serve Rural Veterans VA's longstanding efforts continue to help bridge the gap between rural Veterans and the resources available to them. Through outreach efforts, telehealth services, mobile clinics, and partnerships with local community organizations, VA is working diligently to address the specific needs of rural Veterans and improve their overall well-being. Outreach Initiatives VA is committed to reaching rural Veterans where they are, ensuring they can access healthcare services and information about benefits, mental health support, and other available resources. This outreach involves partnering with various agencies, including Veteran Service Organizations (VSO), State Departments of Veterans Affairs, Federal agencies, and non-governmental organizations. VA.gov offers an online platform for Veterans to learn about, apply for, and manage their VA benefits and health care. In rural communities, VA collaborates with Rural Outreach Coordinators, VHA's Office of Rural Health (ORH), Mobile Vet Centers, County Veterans Service Officers, Transition Assistance Advisors, disability and aging network organizations, and community faith-based organizations to coordinate outreach support for events. VA's success in providing updated benefits and service information to rural Veterans is largely due to its collaboration with local VSO Officers. The Rural Veteran Special Emphasis outreach program identifies gaps in benefits delivery to remote locations, ensuring equal access to and knowledge of all benefits. In FY 2023, VA completed over 1,100 Rural Veteran outreach events, connecting with over 300,000 Veterans, Service members, and beneficiaries. Additionally, Regional Offices across the U.S. have outreach plans based on their state's Veteran demographic and population data. For instance, the Winston- Salem Regional Office uses this data to determine the best methods for rural and untethered Veterans. They also collaborate with VA, VSOs, and other Veteran stakeholders to ensure effective outreach. Further, the Homeless Veterans Outreach Program focuses on assisting homeless or at- risk Veterans through outreach events and partnerships with stakeholders. Rural Partners Network to Empower Rural Communities to Access Federal Resources. The Office of Rural Engagement (ORE) is a key partner in the Rural Partners Network (RPN), a whole-of-government initiative led by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. ORE collaborates with various stakeholders, including the RPN, government agencies, and community organizations, to understand and address the unique needs of rural Veterans. The ORE's mission is to leverage the strengths of the Federal Government, the Department of Veteran Affairs, and Veterans themselves to build resilient rural communities and improve the health and well-being of rural Veterans. ORE connects VA programs and policies to the unique needs of rural Veterans, employing a whole-of-government approach to support and engage both Veterans and their communities. It serves as the front door for rural Veterans, improving accessibility to resources specific to their needs. ORE also assesses VA policy implications for rural Veterans, providing relevant information to Congress, the White House, the Interagency, and VA senior leadership. VA conducts outreach to engage rural Veterans and their advocates, aiming to increase participation in earned benefits and develop effective strategies for reaching rural communities. Compensation and Pension (C&P) Examinations and VA's Over-Development Reduction Task Force VA strives to improve service delivery to the rural Veteran population. VA's Medical Disability Examination (MDE) vendors understand the need to expedite C&P examinations in remote geographical locations with limited medical resources. VA uses several methods to ensure rural Veterans are receiving C&P examinations in a timely manner. VA began using the Acceptable Clinical Evidence (ACE) process to streamline and enhance the disability claims evaluation. The ACE process provides C&P examination services for Veterans that reside in rural areas, and those who are elderly and may have difficulty traveling distances, utilizing C&P examiners who assess Veterans using Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs) and existing medical evidence, supplemented by interviews conducted telephonically or via video when deemed appropriate. From FY 2021 to FY 2023, MDE vendors have increased their ACE modality usage by 123.8 percent. Tele-C&P (that is, telehealth) examinations expanded in 2020. The use of telehealth in the C&P disability examination program provides services for Veterans who reside in rural areas, those who are elderly and may have difficulty traveling distances, and those requiring specialty examinations. This allows for flexible exam scheduling and reduces the likelihood a Veteran will miss their examination. Tele-C&P examinations use video technologies for accurate face-to-face assessments, ensuring safety and efficiency. From FY 2021 to FY 2023, MDE vendors have increased their Tele-C&P modality usage by 74.6 percent. VA has also utilized vendors to deploy mobile units throughout the country to augment existing provider networks and provide a full range of exam services which allow Veterans to undergo exams where they live. These units allow providers to conduct examinations in rural areas of every state within the lower 48 states. Mobile units are equipped to complete general medical and most specialty exams, as well as diagnostic testing. The units are handicap accessible, with wheelchair lifts and ramps, and are fully self-contained with power supply and internet connectivity, allowing for secure evidence transmission to VA systems. VA Medical Disability Examinations (MDE) Contract Vendors continue to expand their mobile unit fleets and collectively have 31 operational individual units. VA collaborates internally with other VA benefits and services offices committed to reaching our rural Veterans, such as VA's Office of Outreach, Transition, and Economic Development, Office of Field Operations, Office of Tribal Government Relations, local VHA Outreach Coordinators, as well as VSOs, to support claims clinic events by providing onsite C&P examinations utilizing MDE vendor Mobile Units. MDE vendors have supported events for C&P examinations with the Crow Agency, Cheyenne, Arapahoe, Saginaw-Chippewa, and Apsaalooke Tribes. MDE vendors are beginning to use newly approved innovative measures to complete C&P examinations such as boothless technology for audio exams, newly approved portable visual field-testing units for optometry exams, and wearable home sleep monitoring devices for in-home sleep studies. These technologies reduce the need for Veterans to travel in some geographical areas. In addition to increased examination modalities, MDE vendors use traveling providers and per-diem or rented locations, such as a temporary medical office space in Fulton, Illinois, to assist rural Veteran populations. License portability is utilized by MDE vendors, allowing covered examiners to travel across state lines to supplement the provider network in areas with limited medical provider options. Supporting Rural Veterans' Health ORH also works to improve the health and well-being of rural Veterans by increasing access to care and services. Nine specific programs include: (1) Telemedicine: ORH supports various telemedicine programs, including Clinical Resource Hubs for primary care, mental health and substance use disorder treatment, and specialty care in 18 VISNs, Tele-Critical Care for remote critical care expertise in rural intensive care units, and over a dozen specific telemedicine programs in various specialties. (2) Transportation: ORH collaborates with the Veterans Transportation Program to support two programs that provide transportation options to rural Veterans. The Highly Rural Transportation Grant Program grants to local and tribal programs, while the Veteran Transportation Service offers services like VetRide and ambulances, partnering with VSOs. (3) Broadband: ORH, in collaboration with the Office of Connected Care, is providing VA Video Connect Patient Tablet program equipment, training, and broadband to Veterans without access. (4) Workforce: Rural health care can be disproportionately impacted by both chronic and sudden shortages. ORH is working to leverage the full VA workforce through telemedicine, clinical education and training to rural sites, and disseminating best practices for recruiting and retaining providers in rural areas. (5) Other Specific Rural Clinical Initiatives: ORH has developed a pipeline of innovation and research to enhance care models for rural Veterans, including 36 enterprise-wide initiatives, 9 Rural Promising Practices, and hundreds of small-scale pilots in various fields like primary care, emergency medicine, geriatrics, and more. Caring for Veterans Where They Are Telehealth, mobile clinics, and innovative technologies are also helping bridge health care barriers. Telehealth reduces wait times and travel costs, mobile clinics bring health care directly to rural communities, and wearable devices enable effective home health management. These approaches promote preventive care, early intervention, and reduce emergency treatment costs, improving the quality of life for rural Veterans. Telehealth. In FY 2023, the VA delivered more telehealth services than in any previous fiscal year, while achieving increased Veteran trust and satisfaction. Over 11.6 million telehealth episodes were delivered to over 2.4 million unique Veterans, with over 2.9 million delivered to over 770,000 rural Veterans. Further, 48.6 percent of rural Veterans identified telehealth as their preferred mode of care. Telehealth also allows VA to expand clinical capacity and address health care disparities in rural areas by sharing clinical services across its health care system. The Clinical Resource Hub program delivered over 340,000 telehealth encounters to over 144,000 rural Veterans in FY 2023, a 21 percent increase in the number of encounters delivered to rural Veterans. Additionally, VA Health Connect offers 24/ 7 access to dedicated clinical triage registered nurses, urgent care providers, clinical pharmacy, and pharmacy support. It provides four essential core services: scheduling and administrative services, clinical triage, virtual clinic, and pharmacy. In the last fiscal year alone, VA Health Connect saw an increase of 3 million calls from rural Veterans and a nearly 70 percent increase in Virtual Clinic visits by rural Veterans. Community Care. VA provides care to Veterans through community providers when VA cannot provide the care needed. The department does so through Third-Party Administrators (TPA), who maintain and strengthen the provider network, particularly in rural areas with fewer providers. The reliance on community care in rural areas continues to grow; it remains critical that we maintain a network of providers to ensure Veterans receive needed care. In cases where there are not enough providers in certain areas, VA works with TPAs to adjust reimbursement rates. The rate waiver process allows TPAs to request higher rates to attract providers to the network. The relationship with TPAs is a two-way dialog, with ongoing monthly meetings to address standing and emerging needs. If TPAs are not meeting designated metrics, they must develop a corrective action plan and report regularly on measures they are taking to improve access to care. Beneficiary Travel The beneficiary travel program addresses the financial and logistical challenges of traveling long distances for specialized medical care for rural Veterans. This program reimburses eligible Veterans for travel expenses, such as mileage, lodging, and meals, ensuring they receive the care they need. It not only improves access to necessary medical appointments but also alleviates financial stress, allowing rural Veterans to prioritize their health without worrying about associated costs. VA's commitment to beneficiary travel is an important part of providing comprehensive and inclusive health care services to rural Veterans. Homelessness VA is committed to ending homelessness among Veterans because it is our Nation's duty to ensure all Veterans have a safe place to call home, including Veterans living in rural areas. One of the programs making that possible is the VA Grant-Per-Diem (GPD) program, which provides 365 transitional housing grants, including to rural organizations. These grants provide 10,500 total GPD beds nationwide. The program operates in all 50 states, Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico. GPD grantees establish programs to meet their communities' unique needs. They collaborate with VAMCs to identify resource gaps and determine how their proposed grants may fill them. Grant funding decisions consider factors like geographic dispersion, equity, and responsiveness to community needs. GPD continues to support rural communities and end homelessness among Veterans by providing transitional housing resources. Chairman Bost, Ranking Member Takano, thank you for the opportunity to discuss VA's efforts to best serve Veterans living in rural communities. Through our collaborative efforts, we are proud to have expanded our reach and provided more benefits and more care to more Veterans than ever before. Rural Veterans, and all Veterans, benefit from the strong working relationship between VA and Congress. We appreciate your continued partnership as we embrace our collective responsibility to serve those who have served. ______ Prepared Statement of Alyssa Hundrup  Prepared Statement of Marisa Schultz Introduction I want to begin by thanking Chairman Bost, Ranking Member Takano and Members of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs for this opportunity to speak as a representative of the rural veteran community. I greatly appreciate the Committee's dedication to our Veterans and their families. My name is Marisa Schultz; I am a disabled combat veteran and veteran advocate. I served in the Illinois National Guard, having deployed to Iraq in 2004. I have personal and professional experience utilizing the Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare system in a rural area. I serve professionally, helping veterans in my community identify their needs and helping them access VA healthcare systems, community care, and other outside providers. Today, I come to you as a veteran looking to help my fellow veterans get the best access and care possible at the VA. To make the most substantial difference for rural veterans, the Committee can direct its attention toward enhancing the programs and services below. Telehealth Telehealth has emerged as an invaluable asset in healthcare, notably benefiting me personally. I have been able to secure mental health services through community care with a telehealth provider who resides in another state. This kind of healthcare connection would only exist with telehealth. It's crucial, however, to highlight my access to stable internet and ability to navigate technology and how this supports my positive experience with telehealth. Along with my own experiences, I can also attest to the experiences of veterans challenged by rural geography, low incomes, and homelessness. The flexibility of telehealth has significantly expanded accessibility yet brings some notable challenges. The elderly/aging population encounters challenging barriers due to inexperience with technology, hindering the seamless use of the telehealth system. Furthermore, rural low-income and homeless veterans face complex limitations. Limited phone minutes, a glaring issue among this demographic, challenge the full utilization of telehealth services. Additionally, the dire need for internet access among rural low-income veterans poses an additional financial burden. Despite the availability of iPads equipped for telehealth within the VA system, I have seen that the procurement process proves complex and presents hurdles, thus delaying timely access to care. The CARES Act improved communication between providers and veterans; however, rural areas still lack adequate access. Implementing tailored training programs for our aging and digitally illiterate veterans and enhancing digital literacy can help bridge the gap. Reestablishing the VA Homeless program: The disposable smartphone initiative would be another way to reduce communication barriers and provide better access to telehealth for our rural veterans. Also, those accessing the VA Homeless Disposable Smartphone Initiative can now answer calls regarding VA appointments and have the ability to receive calls about potential jobs. Additionally, staff education on services that could help our rural veterans is necessary. Addressing these challenges and implementing robust solutions, the VA can provide access to quality healthcare regardless of veterans' location or digital literacy. Beneficiary Travel VA beneficiary travel poses considerable challenges for rural veterans. Criteria for VA transportation include individuals who must be at least 30 percent service-connected or have low income. Additionally, specialized transportation is a prerequisite, making accessibility a hurdle. While mileage reimbursement supports those with personal vehicles, reaching a VA facility in rural areas often demands one or two hours of travel. We are speaking of a population whose vehicles cannot be correctly maintained due to low income. Traveling hours at a time, risking the vehicle that gets them to basic needs and work, is challenging for rural veterans. In my own experience, I have witnessed rural veterans struggle with meeting the criteria for VA- provided transportation to appointments. I have observed numerous veterans missing appointments due to a lack of transportation and availability. One specific veteran who has chronic pain from a helicopter crash, while deployed, requested transportation to VA appointments. This particular veteran was authorized travel assistance, but when it came time for them to be picked up, transportation did not show. After being assured this would not happen again, this happened three more times, leading this veteran to call 988 (suicide hotline) due to the stress and frustration of a system they felt failed them. This is often aggravated by appointment cards arriving only days before or after scheduled appointments, leaving inadequate time for transportation arrangements. Seeking reimbursement for beneficiary travel also presents challenges for our aging and digitally illiterate rural veterans. Several veterans I work with require assistance submitting mileage reimbursement claims due to difficulties navigating va.gov and the Beneficiary Travel Self Service System (BTSSS). Improvements for beneficiary travel could involve enhanced VA transportation by expanding coverage and ensuring reliability. This can involve better scheduling systems for more time to arrange transportation. When making appointments, an option to sign up for travel reimbursement as part of the scheduling process could significantly reduce veteran frustration. Rural areas often lack local transportation services or community organizations to provide reliable transportation options for veterans residing in rural areas; forming partnerships with service organizations for ease of use would be beneficial. Increasing the availability and promotion of telehealth with education and access could reduce the need for physical visits. Simplifying the reimbursement process for beneficiary travel, creating a user-friendly system, or providing assistance programs to aid veterans, especially those aging and with digital illiteracy, can assist rural veterans in claiming reimbursements for their travel expenses. Policy changes are needed to address limitations in VA beneficiary travel criteria. This will make it more inclusive for rural veterans who face challenges in meeting the current requirements. As a more significant consideration for rural veterans, the deployment of Mobile Medical Units (MMU), especially in rural areas, could provide essential medical services directly to veterans, reducing the need for extensive travel. In August 2023, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced they were deploying 25 Mobile Medical Units nationwide, with 23 presently active. Although the current MMUs focus on large homeless populations, utilizing MMUs in rural areas could be a game changer. With the ability to ``meet veterans where they are,'' providing sign-up services, primary care, mental health clinics, access to social workers, women's health, audiology, laboratory, and education on telehealth for those who do not have access to VA medical centers due to transportation limitations could significantly increase healthcare access to our rural veterans. Inadequate grant and per diem rates for homeless veterans The VA Grant and Per Diem program aims to assist organizations in offering homeless veterans transitional housing, care, and other supportive services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, several adjustments were made to support homeless veterans in GPD programs. Rates have since decreased and significantly affected the ability to assist effectively in rural areas. If rates were returned to the previous years' rates, rural grant per diem programs could offer competitive wages to retain employees for consistency of care. GPD sites could hire additional staffing for housing navigation and landlord recruitment to facilitate low-barrier entry into housing and better facilitate same- day access/enrollment in GPD programs. For those unable to be housed immediately, there would be funds for emergency hotel stays. Rural GPD programs would also be able to contract transportation for veterans, making access to care more manageable for those in the GPD programs through the VA. Insufficient funding can limit the quality and range of services available to our rural homeless veterans. Emergency funding provided a short-term solution but did not address the long-term financial needs of GPD programming. The need for sustained and adequate support for homeless veterans remains a critical issue. In supporting this vulnerable population, regular assessments and adjustments of grant and per diem rates that align with the actual costs of providing housing and supportive services are a must. Adequate access to healthcare providers Shifting the focus to access to healthcare providers, I find myself fortunate to be a part of a community that houses a Community-Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC). With the privilege of owning a vehicle and a job that supports flexibility for medical visits, coupled with the convenience of digital communication through va.gov and myhealthyvet portal, my access to healthcare stands at a level that eludes many in our rural areas. Recognizing this privilege fuels my passion for aiding rural veterans, especially those grappling with low income or homelessness, to secure equitable access to healthcare. I encounter veterans who lack transportation means, making it nearly impossible for them to reach healthcare providers. It's evident that meeting veterans where they are, particularly in rural areas, is pivotal for their well-being. I've witnessed veterans neglecting their health needs due to financial constraints or employment vulnerabilities. I have worked with a veteran working hard to get out of homelessness, putting their mental health on hold because they want to do better for themselves and their family, and the risk of losing their job prevented them from getting proper care. For many, the fear of losing their jobs due to taking time off for medical appointments further complicates matters. I have seen dental care for our rural veterans be impossible to get, affecting their overall health. A veteran who was injured on deployment has needed extensive dental work, bone grafts, and posts. It has taken three years to get an appointment for an assessment, causing extreme emotional distress to the family and veteran. I have seen veterans who request mental health appointments have to wait months to be seen. One potential solution is expanding health care services such as Mobile Medical Units (MMU) for primary care. These units, strategically deployed to areas where traditional healthcare access is limited, have the potential to bridge that gap. Extending VA hours, including weekend appointments and introducing MMUs, can significantly enhance healthcare accessibility for rural veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs initiative in 2023 to deploy mobile medical units nationwide is promising. However, I have noticed a concentration of these units in major metropolitan areas, often neglecting rural regions where the need for accessible healthcare is equally critical. For real transformation for rural veterans, healthcare access with MMUs must extend its reach beyond urban areas. It's essential to devise a more coordinated approach that considers the geographical disparities and prioritizes areas with limited access to traditional VA medical centers. In addition to the MMUs, enhancing telehealth services, making them more accessible and user-friendly for veterans and rural regions, and providing transportation solutions are all ways to combat limited access to healthcare for our rural veterans. I urge you today to consider ``meeting our veterans where they are.'' Compensation and pension exams Accessing compensation and pension examinations has been a significant challenge, particularly considering the logistical hurdles and emotional strain involved. Drawing from my personal encounters, these examinations are critical for veterans' well-being; however, they are often presented with formidable obstacles. In my case, securing a female provider, a basic yet serious request, necessitated a two-hour commute, reflecting a limited availability of specific practitioners in my rural location. My first-hand experience took me through four different towns for these examinations, each site requiring a considerable travel distance, none closer than an hour away. This exhausting journey was compounded by the emotional toll often accompanying such assessments. Witnessing veterans struggling with transportation barriers has compelled me to assist them in reaching their appointments. One incident stands out vividly: I supported a veteran on a two-hour drive only to face an abrupt cancellation 15 minutes before the scheduled examination. This unforeseen disruption added distress to an already trying experience underlying the emotional preparation veterans invest in these evaluations. Working closely with another veteran, I encountered a stark reality that there would be a three f1/2-hour commute for their compensation and pension exam. This individual struggling with homelessness and lacking personal transportation faced an audacious journey to attend that appointment. Through collaborative efforts with the local veteran support organization, we managed to arrange transportation, be it with the inherent discomfort of relying on an unfamiliar volunteer, adding to the distress and an already emotionally charged examination. While the VA system has made strides in enhancing these examinations utilizing outside organizations, there remains a clear need for further improvements addressing transportation challenges, enhancing proximity to examination facilities, and considering the emotional strain endured by veterans during this process are essential areas for refinement within the system. Improving access to compensation and pension examinations can be addressed by establishing more examination centers in rural or underserved areas to consider reduced travel distances for veterans. These centers could offer a wide range of examinations to minimize the need for extensive travel. Expanding transportation assistance programs specifically tailored for veterans attending examinations can alleviate the burden of long commutes. Recognizing the emotional impact of these examinations and providing support services or counseling to veterans before and after examinations could help alleviate the stress and anxiety associated with the process. The central focus is meeting veterans where they are--in rural communities, so they have the ability to access the healthcare they have earned. Conclusion As you deliberate on these strategies to improve rural access to healthcare for rural veterans, keep these stories in mind. Each narrative underscores the imperative need for actionable solutions. Thank you again for the opportunity to participate in today's hearing on rural healthcare access and how VA can better meet veterans where they live. I and other veterans like me sincerely appreciate your continued support of veterans. ______ Prepared Statement of Buu Nygren My name is Dr. Buu Nygren, and I serve as the President of the Navajo Nation. I come before you today to discuss the critical and ongoing issue of access to care and benefits for our Navajo veterans, who have a proud and storied history of military service. Background The Navajo People hold a special place in American military history, having made extraordinary and unparalleled contributions. During the harrowing years of World War II, a select group of Navajo patriots, known as the Navajo Code Talkers, were pivotal to securing the Allied victory in the Pacific Theater. Harnessing the complexity and beauty of the Dine language, these heroes crafted an unbreakable code that confounded the Japanese military intelligence. In the blood-soaked sands of Iwo Jima, Navajo Code Talkers operated with relentless precision, flawlessly transmitting over 800 messages in the span of the first 48 hours of combat. Their efforts were impeccable, their dedication unwavering, and their impact on the war, immeasurable. Astoundingly, the participation of the Navajo people in World War II was not a mere footnote; over one in ten Navajos answered the call to serve--a testament to their indelible spirit and enduring patriotism. For more than two decades, the Code Talker program was shrouded in secrecy, their vital role in the Allied victory hidden from public accolades. Unbeknownst to many, the threads of Navajo valor continued to be woven through the fabric of American military engagements, from the bitter cold of Korea to the arid landscapes of the Middle East. The legacy of military service within the Navajo Nation is not just a chapter in history; it is a venerated tradition, a badge of honor that reflects the unyielding courage, resourcefulness, and sacrifice that define the Navajo people. The commitment of Native Americans to the United States military tapestry is not limited to the Navajo Nation. Native Americans have enlisted to serve at the highest rate of any ethnic group, demonstrating a profound dedication to the country. This tradition of service stretches back to the earliest days of the nation, from the Oneida warriors who fought alongside the Continental Army to the Cherokee and Choctaw Code Talkers of World War I, who used their languages to secure communications. Remarkably, this level of service was provided at a time when Native Americans were not yet fully recognized as American citizens. Despite this, an estimated 15,000 Native Americans served in World War I, accounting for nearly a quarter of the Native American adult male population of the time. Their valor was undeniable, yet it took until 2008 for the United States to officially acknowledge and honor the contributions of the Native Code Talkers from both World Wars. In a profound expression of reverence for those who have served, the Navajo Nation took a significant step in 2016. The 23rd Navajo Nation Council, in a unanimous decision, enacted Legislation No. 0006- 16, establishing the Navajo Nation Veterans Administration (``NNVA'') as an entity dedicated to the welfare of Navajo veterans. This historic move, spearheaded by President Russell Begaye, was not simply administrative; it was a declaration of the inherent value and dignity of Navajo servicemen and women. This commitment bore fruit on May 2, 2022, when the NNVA was acknowledged by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs as the first tribal organization to be entrusted with assisting Native American veterans in navigating their benefits. This recognition is not just an administrative success; it is a beacon of respect and acknowledgment for the sacrifices and service of all Native American veterans, who have shown time and again that their bravery and . . . who have shown time and again that their bravery and loyalty know no bounds. The story of the Navajo warriors and Native American servicemen and women is one of unheralded sacrifice, of silent valor that echoes through the generations. It is a narrative that deserves its rightful place in the forefront of our nation's consciousness, a narrative that should be taught to our children as an integral piece of the American tapestry. These warriors, from the deserts of Arizona to the forests of the Northeast, have not only defended the United States but have also enriched its character, strengthened its resolve, and honored the very principles upon which it was founded. The Navajo Nation, along with the greater Native American community, has exemplified a commitment to service that transcends the call of duty. Their contributions have been etched into the stone of our nation's history, a permanent reminder of the price of freedom and the enduring strength of the human spirit. As we pay tribute to the Navajo Code Talkers and all Native American veterans, let us not simply remember their deeds as acts of the past. Instead, let them inspire us and guide us toward a future where their dedication to community, country, and valor are the standards to which we all aspire. The legacy of the Navajo Nation's contribution to military service is not just a chapter in history; it is a continuing journey of honor, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to the ideals of liberty and justice for all. Healthcare Through programs like pensions for Revolutionary War veterans and institutions like the Naval Asylum (1811) and the Soldiers' Home (1851), America has always sought to reward veterans for their service and sacrifice. From the first consolidation into the Veterans Bureau in 1921 to the Department of Veterans Affairs today, the VA has striven to continue this mission of caring for those who have sacrificed for America. Today, the VA operates over 1,600 healthcare facilities across the Nation, and nearly 75 percent of service-connected American Indian/ Alaskan Native (''AI/AN'') veterans utilize VA healthcare. Despite the rich history of service, Navajo veterans face significant barriers in accessing the care and benefits afforded them through their patriotism and sacrifices. The closest VA medical centers are hundreds of miles away from the Navajo Nation, in Phoenix, Arizona, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Salt Lake City, Utah. Distance presents a formidable obstacle, and our veterans are often forced to travel long hours, at great personal expense, across remote areas and countless miles to receive basic services such as routine exams. This burden is compounded by social determinants that disproportionately affect our community, such as high rates of poverty, unemployment, and limited access to transportation, internet, and other necessities. To put the distance into perspective, a Navajo veteran living in Shiprock, NM, our largest community with over 8,000 residents, would need to drive 214 miles, roughly 4 hours, one-way to reach the closest full-service VA medical center, in Albuquerque, NM. A Navajo veteran living in Kayenta, AZ with over 5,000 residents located in the northwestern part of the Nation, would need to drive 291 miles, roughly 5 hours one-way, to reach the closest full-service VA medical center in Phoenix, AZ. A Navajo veteran living in Montezuma Creek, our northernmost community in Utah would have to drive a staggering 351 miles, roughly 6 hours without breaks to reach the VA Medical Center in Salt Lake City. These are rural roads that can be unpassable in winter. The distance between AI/AN veterans and centers is a significant factor in their likelihood to delay care, as well as not getting through the phone and not getting timely appointments. Additionally, AI/AN veterans tend to be less likely to get dental care, prescription medications, medical care and glasses than white veterans, despite being more likely to need these services due to the difficulty for them to get full services from the VA. The challenges of not having a full- service VA medical center are exacerbated when veterans need specialty care. There are only three VA clinics on the Navajo Nation (Chinle, Tuba City, and Kayenta) and their focus is on primary care, laboratories, and less severe mental health issues. Considering that AI/AN veterans who use VA mental health services tend to experience Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) at a greater rate than all other veteran groups, the fact that the three VA clinics on the Nation focus on less severe mental health issues is a present concern. Another present concern is that AI/AN veterans are diagnosed with chronic pain and diabetes at a higher rate than any other veteran group, and that AI/AN veteran women are two times more likely to experience pregnancy difficulties due to hypertension or diabetes than white veteran women. None of the clinics can provide specialty care such as cardiology, oncology, or osteology. A veteran should not have to travel several hours each way to see a specialist, especially when those medical conditions may have been the price for their service to the United States. Furthermore, in addition to the difficulty AI/AN veterans have accessing vital health resources to get treatment for medical conditions that might have stemmed from their time in the military, they also share the same negative social determinants of health that other AI/AN citizens have. For the Navajo, whether they are a veteran or not, the average life expectancy is that of 72.3 years, 4.2 years lower than the average U.S. life expectancy, and Navajo have a 31 percent higher mortality rate than the U.S. average. The leading cause of death for the Navajo is unintentional injury, and the second one is heart disease. Another challenge is the cost of travel to the full-service facilities. According to the Department of Veteran Affairs, AI/AN veterans have the lowest personal incomes among veterans of other races/ethnicities. The median income of an AI/AN veteran is $29,920, over $10,000 less annually than white veterans. The median income of Navajo veterans is in line with these disproportionate numbers at $30,682. Considering that a Navajo veteran would likely need to stay at a hotel given the 8-hour or more roundtrip drive to receive specialized care and the high cost of gas, the commute to VA medical centers has a disproportionate economic effect on Navajo veterans. The current mileage reimbursement by the VA is $0.415 per mile approved. The same veteran traveling from Shiprock, NM would travel 428 miles roundtrip and be reimbursed $177.62. With a current national average gas price of $3.088 as of January 05, 2023, it would cost a Navajo veteran $74.11 to fill up a 24-gallon tank, not to mention wear and tear on their vehicle. Given the heavily agricultural economy of the Nation along with the severe winter storms we experience, most Navajo citizens drive larger vehicles which are not fuel efficient. Lower income levels also translate into older vehicles and therefore are even less fuel efficient and subject to more costly/frequent maintenance. The cost of transportation in gas and maintenance can easily exceed the mileage reimbursement. Telehealth services, while beneficial, are not a cure-all for our veterans. The digital divide is a stark reality for the Navajo Nation, where many veterans lack adequate internet access, or the technology needed to utilize telehealth effectively. This limitation is not just a matter of convenience, but a barrier to essential healthcare, mental health services, and benefits assistance. According to the FCC, about 23 percent of households in the Nation do not have access to download/upload internet speeds of at least 25/3 mega-bits per second (mbps). This is the minimum speed a single device needs to have an adequate video call assuming no other devices are connected at the same time. Only 3.54 percent of households in the Navajo Nation have download/upload speeds of at least 100/200 mbps, which is typical of a single to small household. The VA's beneficiary travel program is critical, yet it does not fully offset the high costs and logistical challenges associated with long-distance travel to VA facilities. Furthermore, grant and per diem rates for homeless veterans do not reflect the higher costs of living in remote areas, which further disadvantages our veterans in need. I am respectfully requesting Congress to consider appropriating funds to build a full-service VA medical center ion the NavajoNation. Having this center on the Nation would contribute greatly to providing the quality of care our veterans deserve. It would also have a tremendous and positive economic impact for the Nation. The medical center would not just serve Navajo veterans, but much of rural Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. The tax dollars generated from gas, food, and other items purchased within the Nation would be contributed to providing more services to our Dine people. It would also help keep our limited Navajo tax dollars in the Nation instead of going to our surrounding states. My recommendation on how to meet veterans where they are and provide competent and quality care breaks down into five parts: First, Congress should work with the Department of Veterans Affairs to conduct a comprehensive needs analysis, incorporating key factors such as population demographics, healthcare consumption trends, and the incidence of specific health conditions among Navajo veterans. This data-driven approach will provide an accurate understanding of healthcare needs of Navajo veterans and pave the way for targeted interventions. Second, we should foster collaboration between Congress, the VA, Navajo Nation leaders, and tribal health authorities. This will be instrumental in gaining a nuanced understanding of the existing healthcare infrastructure, identifying synergistic partnership opportunities, and ensuring the proposed VA medical center aligns with the cultural values and healthcare expectations of Navajo veterans. Third, we should commit resources for infrastructure development by allocating sufficient funds and resources for constructing and operationalizing the VA medical center. It is imperative to ensure that the center is appropriately staffed with healthcare professionals who are adept at managing the unique healthcare needs of Navajo veterans. Fourth, we should integrate telehealth services by incorporating and expanding telehealth services to provide remote healthcare access, especially for those veterans residing in distant areas where travel to a VA medical center is difficult. This digital platform can enhance healthcare accessibility while reducing travel-related barriers. Fifth and finally, we should adopt a culturally competent care model. The healthcare services at the VA medical center should be culturally competent, integrating traditional healing practices and respecting the cultural and linguistic diversity of the Navajo Nation. Such an approach will foster a sense of belonging and trust among Navajo veterans, thereby encouraging them to seek and adhere to necessary healthcare services. Other Services Another challenge our Navajo veterans face is inadequate access to information regarding their benefits and entitlements. In 2017, less than half of AI/AN veterans used at least one VA benefit or service. The Navajo Nation Veterans Administration is proposing the construction of a regional Veterans Administration Center / Veterans Benefits Administration Center, a one-of-a-kind community-based outreach center of sorts, that is available to all veterans but focuses services on Native American veterans. The purpose of this facility is to provide much needed services in a geographical area that are not currently being delivered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. This facility would serve as a hub for a variety of services that include non-emergency / non-urgent care services typically found outside of a Veteran Affairs Medical Center (``VAMC''), such as physical or occupational therapy, mental health services, vocational training and education, temporary / transitional housing, and transportation services, as well as serving as an administrative facility for Navajo Nation, state, and federal VA staff to administer program services. The Navajo Nation has already chosen a location for this facility and taken the legal step of ``withdrawing'' the land so that it is preserved for this facility. It is situated on New Mexico's Highway 264, less than two miles from the Arizona state line, and adjacent to the Navajo Nation capital in Window Rock, Arizona. It is located adjacent to the future Navajo Code Talkers Museum site. This site has easy access to public roads with heavy traffic, as well as existing power, water, and sewage. It has been determined through surveys that the site is appropriate for the construction of a project of this magnitude. This facility is also consistent with the master plan for this area's development, which will boost the Navajo Nation's economic development efforts. Congress must provide adequate funding for facility construction. The Navajo Nation also has a very high portion of senior citizen veterans. Over 46 percent of veterans living on the Nation are aged 65 or older. Many of these veterans need quality nursing home care and are severely underserved. There are no VA recognized nursing homes on the Nation, or within a reasonable commute. Our veterans living in the Utah portion of the Nation again have the longest distance with the closest VA contracted nursing home being 327 miles away from Montezuma Creek. The distance makes it difficult for families to visit their loved ones in their retirement and final years. I respectfully ask Congress to work with both the Navajo Veterans Affairs Administration and the US Department of Veteran Affairs to get our nursing homes VA contracted. Conclusion The lack of adequate VA care on the Navajo Nation dishonors the contributions the Navajo people have made to the defense of this country. Our veterans have earned the right to accessible, quality care and benefits through their service and sacrifice. I urge this Committee and Congress to take decisive action to address these critical issues faced by Navajo veterans. We need increased funding aimed specifically at improving infrastructure and services in rural and highly rural areas, tailored to the unique challenges of these regions. We must bridge the digital divide to ensure telehealth is a viable option for all veterans. It is essential to adjust grant and per diem rates to reflect the true cost of living in remote areas, and to expand the beneficiary travel program to alleviate the significant financial burden on our veterans. Our Navajo veterans have honored their commitments to our country. It is time that we honor our commitments to them. Thank you for your time and consideration. Ahehee' (Thank you). ______ Prepared Statement of Jon Lovald Chairman Bost, Ranking Member Takano, and Committee Members, my name is Jon Lovald and I'm the Chief Operations Officer for the Minnesota Assistance Council for Veterans--MACV. We are a 501c3 statewide nonprofit with the mission to end veteran homelessness in Minnesota. I began with MACV in May 2017. Before my time at MACV, I served in the Army and Minnesota National Guard for 25 years, retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel. I am beyond honored to be a part of MACV and our mission, working to incorporate housing for all Minnesota veterans with wrap-around services for stability. MACV has served veterans and families experiencing or facing homelessness since 1990. We do so with a wide-reaching, comprehensive network of over 100 staff, as well as community partners throughout the state. The experience, professionalism and compassion our team shows the veterans we serve speaks to a devotion to mission. MACV's services include housing stability case management, landlord engagement, employment, healthcare navigation, legal services, permanent and transitional housing, financial management and representative payee services launched through the VA's Money Management Intervention pilot. MACV operates statewide through offices in the Twin Cities, Duluth, Saint Cloud, Moorhead, Mankato, Bemidji, and Rochester. The key to success in all our programs is the combination of individualized services each client receives with MACV's singular goal for all veterans to achieve or maintain housing stability. MACV is proud to receive more than $7 million in federal grants each year. Our awards include grants through the U.S. Veterans Administration (Supportive Services for Veteran Families--SSVF, Grant & Per Deim transitional and case management grants - GPD, and Legal Services for Veterans - LSV), the U.S. Department of Labor (Urban and Non-Urban Homeless Veteran Reintegration Program - HVRP), and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (four rural Continuum of Care grants). These federal grants make up the single largest source of funding for MACV and our mission. MACV operates 225 beds of transitional and permanent supportive housing scattered across the state. These units, including 52 in Greater Minnesota, have gradually come online through a combination of federal, state, and philanthropic partnerships. This year, we plan to open at least 11 new housing units in the Twin Cities metro, and an additional 8 in Greater Minnesota. We are excited to offer supportive housing in the Rochester area for the first time in the coming months, providing much-needed options in one of Minnesota's hardest-hit regions for lack of affordable housing. Our staff has witnessed a significant uptick in veterans needing assistance since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. In many rural communities, the scarcity of local support makes MACV's outreach and engagement activities even more crucial. Strategic outreach provides rural communities with a wide array of resources that empower veterans to stay ahead of crises and remain in their communities. We leverage a variety of federal, state, and philanthropic resources to address the needs of veterans affected by homelessness. We are proud to count our partners within the VA, DOL, and HUD among our strongest allies in the fight to end veteran homelessness in Minnesota, including our rural communities. The funds appropriated to MACV by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs are especially important to our mission's success. In 2023, MACV enrolled 937 veterans in comprehensive services in Greater Minnesota to end or prevent an episode of homelessness. This figure represents a 22 percent increase in the number of rural veterans served in 2021. Of those 937 individuals: 66 percent have a documented disability, including 52 percent with a service-related disability. 47 percent are 55 years of age or older 19 percent have minor children 18 percent identify as Veterans of Color 12 percent were female veterans 62 percent had household income below 50 percent Area Median Income 43 percent were below 30 percent Area Median Income 107 veterans were placed into employment Minnesota is determined to become the fourth state in the union to achieve Functional Zero for veteran homelessness statewide by the end of 2025. The United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) has already qualified MACV and our network of statewide partners as functionally ending veteran homelessness in eight of Minnesota's 10 homeless Continuums of Care (CoC) regions, including its seven rural CoCs. While this declaration does not mean there are no veterans experiencing homelessness within these geographies, it does mean that each region has the systems and partnerships in place to ensure that veteran homelessness is rare, brief, and non-recurring. MACV utilizes numerous tools in pursuit of achieving our mission. Resources including Minnesota's Homeless Veteran Registry (HVR) provide a real-time snapshot of veterans experiencing homelessness anywhere in the state. The HVR allows us to keep count of those experiencing homelessness, their most recent location, the amount of time spent in homelessness, as well as other key pieces of information. As of January 5, 2024, there are 262 veterans on the HVR, including 46 veterans in rural CoCs. Program staff for the HVR partner agencies of MACV, the Minnesota Department of Veterans Affairs, and the VA homeless program teams throughout the state, discuss each veteran on the list at bi- weekly meetings. Regular case conferencing allows for the organizations best situated to serve homeless veterans to identify their needs and barriers, as well as ensure that plans for housing stability are in place and being followed. The need for this service coordination is especially high in rural areas, where resources are geographically spread out. While each veteran experiencing homelessness has their own unique set of challenges and goals on the path to housing stability, there are also noted barriers that the rural veteran consistently faces. Some of the barriers include: Lack of affordable rental housing. Struggling to find jobs that pay a livable wage. Limited to no public transportation options. Scarcity of supportive services. Many communities with no emergency shelter. The lack of affordable rental housing in rural areas has become increasingly acute as climbing rents consistently outpace income in recent years. Once-affordable housing has become much more competitive, while the criteria for selecting rental tenants have grown narrower. In addition to having low income, many veterans on the by-name list have other barriers such as poor credit, a history of prior evictions, a need for handicapped-accessible units, or past justice involvement. These barriers lead to many veterans unable to access housing in their communities even if they can locate an affordable unit. In larger rural population hubs, such as Duluth, Rochester, and Mankato, significant student populations and specialized workforces such as professional staff for the Mayo Clinic in Rochester further reduce the number of affordable housing units available to MACV-served veterans. The challenge experienced by veterans in finding living wage employment closely ties to a lack of public transportation in rural communities. One MACV-served veteran walked 30 miles per day to make it to work until the season changed and that was no longer an option. Veterans without reliable transportation are relegated to finding jobs within walking distance from where they are staying or moving to larger population hubs to find work or job training. As nearly half of the veterans MACV serves in rural communities are over 55, finding living wage employment that is not physically demanding is an even greater challenge in rural areas without diverse industries. To have transportation, many veterans take on the added expense of a vehicle. These vehicles are often unreliable based on what the veteran can afford. This creates additional burdens of repairs, insurance, and fuel that veterans in urban centers can avoid by relying on public transportation. High vehicle costs make it even more challenging to afford housing, leading to difficult choices of paying for housing or for their vehicle to maintain work. Far too often, the vehicles become housing themselves. Many nonprofits, healthcare, chemical health, and mental health services are located in urban centers. The inequity in service availability to obtain and then sustain housing stability is a challenge for rural veterans experiencing homelessness. These services help to navigate a complex web of benefits and resources and require a hands-on approach. With many veterans experiencing housing instability in rural areas having inconsistent access or proficiency with technology, make person-to-person connections more critical, and the shortage of providers more destabilizing. In addition to the challenges of obtaining support for long-term stability, most of rural Minnesota does not have emergency shelters available for homeless community members. As a result, veterans without a place to stay must either leave their home communities to find a warm place to sleep, or survive in the Minnesota winters by sleeping in tents, in trailers with no heat or water, in vehicles, or fish houses. With a lack of shelter in the winter, if a friend or family member of a veteran lets them stay, the veteran may then lose eligibility for homeless designated housing programs and services, putting them back at square one once they are no longer able to temporarily double up. Federal programs that benefit veterans experiencing homelessness are an incredible resource. However, many are not available to veteran households in rural areas. HUD-VASH, which provides a Section 8 voucher coupled with VA clinical case management, does not provide vouchers to many Minnesota rural geographies based on distance to VA supportive services. Where HUD-VASH can provide services, vouchers are scarcer than in urban centers. Local VA Medical Centers in Minnesota have done great work in expanding their geography to cover more communities outside of metropolitan hubs, there remains significant geography outside of the catchment for this resource. Of the 276 rural veterans on the Homeless Veteran Registry throughout 2023, over 80 percent were eligible for HUD-VASH, while only 11 percent received a voucher. In addition, VA Community Based Outreach Clinics (CBOCs) and DOL funded veteran services at American Job Centers, which are often in rural population centers, are miles from many of our most rural Minnesota veterans. While not all federal resources are available in each rural community, as the only VA Supportive Services for Veteran Families grantee in our state, MACV is pleased with the efforts of the VA to ensure that each county in the nation is served by SSVF. Telehealth has also become a great resource for many veterans that we serve by assisting eligible individuals with access to key healthcare resources. While this has been a fantastic expansion of federal support, it is a challenge for the rural veteran experiencing homelessness to use. Many veterans with low incomes have limited or no access to reliable technology like cell phones, or access to laptops. Many veterans simply do not feel comfortable or knowledgeable enough to utilize telehealth, another perennial challenge to an otherwise helpful initiative on the part of the VA. Specific initiatives undertaken by individual VA facilities have also improved client outcomes across Minnesota in recent years. MACV supports Fargo VA's process of opening a Community Resource and Referral Center. This center focuses on serving homeless veterans, particularly rural veterans in the Fargo/Moorhead community, and is an asset to the State. The Minneapolis VAHCS has recognized the dearth of VA presence in many of Minnesota's rural regions and expanded its HUD- VASH catchment to serve more veterans than the standard 30-mile radius around the VA campus. The Minneapolis VA has elected to include 10 public housing authorities in rural Minnesota and Wisconsin, in addition to its standard HUD-VASH catchment area. We are lucky to have such amazing partnerships with our local VA partners on the ground throughout the State. We hold these partnerships up to anyone in the country. Minnesota is fortunate to have a State Department of Veterans Affairs with a shared mission of ending veteran homelessness through innovative practices and initiatives. Addressing the lack of affordable housing in Minnesota, the State has granted funds for housing development for veterans on the Homeless Veteran Registry with the most significant barriers to accessing housing. MACV has used this investment to strategically develop housing in Greater Minnesota. The State has also granted funds to MACV to develop a statewide housing subsidy program with clinical case management, similar to HUD-VASH, specifically targeting veterans who cannot enroll in HUD-VASH. One of the largest beneficiary groups for the subsidy, titled MNVEST, is the veteran population in rural communities that simply do not offer HUD- VASH as a subsidy program. The State has also worked to fill the gap in rural emergency shelters through the administration of a reimbursable hotel shelter program. The State also funds County and Tribal Veteran Service Officers for each county and tribal nation. We know how lucky we are that the State has stepped up to help fill gaps for resources that are not available federally. MACV regularly reaches beyond Minnesota's traditional veteran service agencies in the course of our work. Some of our strongest local allies include County or Tribal Veteran Service Officers, who are county employees working to connect veterans to the benefits and groups which can change the trajectory of their lives. County and Tribal VSOs can assist with the MACV intake process and gather documents and signatures to speed up the time from initial contact to housing solutions. MACV has forged relationships with local American Legion and VFW posts throughout the State. Local chapters of Disabled American Veterans provided more than 7,500 free rides covering 373,000 miles to rural veterans who lack transportation options for important medical appointments in 2023. Leveraging local groups who know the veterans in their community is a key component of our rural outreach strategy that has allowed us to achieve the benchmarks of functional zero in 85 of 87 Minnesota counties. MACV has partnered with thousands of veterans and their families in accessing the resources these individuals earned through service to our country. We understand the many strengths that rural communities have when it comes to taking care of local veterans. While MACV has offices in rural population centers, we intentionally build strong partnerships with those closest to the veterans living everywhere in Minnesota. Federal resources, when implemented locally by the people who best know their community, are key components of Minnesota's progress in ending veteran homelessness. When we equip veterans with tools and support for their success, the resilience of this group is proven to be remarkable. The VA and their federal USICH partners have taken the initiative to lead this effort using proven methods that lift veterans and their loved ones out of homelessness and into the safety and dignity of housing suited to every veteran's needs. Expanding the availability of HUD-VASH, responsively addressing rural transportation barriers for veterans, providing access to technology, and other supportive services targeting rural veterans are simply essential to preserve the progress Minnesota has made in our smaller communities. The VA's temporary expansions for addressing the need for rideshares and cell phone provision made remarkable impacts on the well-being of rural veterans across our state. We hope to see these initiatives reimplemented in the future because they simply work. Thousands of veterans MACV and our VA partners serve each year have unique stories. One veteran, whom we'll call Ryan, served our country for four years in the U.S. Coast Guard before receiving an honorable discharge. He contacted MACV after he lost his wife. Struggling to care for himself while grieving, Ryan was hospitalized and had a partial amputation of his foot. When he was discharged, Ryan was several months behind on rent and about to lose his housing. MACV provided emergency financial assistance to get Ryan back in the black. After a family member living with Ryan was arrested, Ryan was evicted from his home. The lack of reliable transportation and communication put him out of contact with his care team for significant amounts of time. This stint of homelessness ended with Ryan being hospitalized for three months with a life-threatening infection. Following discharge from the hospital, Ryan was placed in a hotel room for emergency shelter while securing more sustainable supportive housing. Today, Ryan resides in a supportive housing unit secured by his MACV team and focuses his time and energy on applying for the benefits and programs that will improve his long-term stability. The story is one with challenges, but the outcome of Ryan living in his own apartment and having his life back as a member of the community is the result that MACV strives to give every single veteran affected by homelessness in Minnesota. MACV has a vision for every veteran we serve to have a way to afford housing, access housing, and have the services and support needed to sustain long-term stability. We could not do this critical work without the support of our federal partners, VA, HUD, DOL, USICH, and Congress. Thank you for your past support of the key federal programs targeting veterans of the U.S. military, and consideration of future initiatives toward achieving our mission to end veteran homelessness in Minnesota and in the United States. ______ Prepared Statement of Mark Holmes Chairman Bost, Ranking Member Takano, and Members of the Committee: My name is Mark Holmes. I am the Director of The Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research and North Carolina Rural Health Research Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am also a professor in the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health. I have been a rural health researcher for 25 years; my expertise is in hospital finance and health policy, especially federal public insurance payment policy. Growing up in Michigan's rural Thumb, I witnessed firsthand some of the health challenges facing our rural communities. The Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research is one of the nation's leading institutions for health services research. Our interdisciplinary researchers undertake innovative research and program evaluation to understand health care access, costs, delivery, outcomes, equity, and value. The Sheps Center has a long-standing reputation for conducting high-quality, objective research that informs science, practice, and policy. The Center's Program on Rural Health Research is one of many Sheps Center programs generating the evidence to inform policy makers about the challenges and opportunities in ensuring access to health care services. For today's hearing, I will speak primarily about challenges facing the non-VHA rural health care system. Rural veterans may qualify to access community (``non-VHA'') providers, so it's important to recognize the fragility of the rural health care system as part of their care. I am unable to cover all the salient issues in rural health today, so I will focus my comments on three main points relevant to today's topic: 1. Rural health care infrastructure continues to erode, and this threatens the health and well-being of the 60 million Americans - including the 4 million veterans--who live in rural areas. 2. Congress can improve the health of rural communities by addressing some specific policy issues in rural health workforce. 3. The common narrative of rural places having sicker, poorer, and older populations is mostly accurate, but is too fatalistic--many rural communities have also shown remarkable ability to use their strength to overcome challenge. Threats to a Robust Rural Health Care System Since 2005, nearly 200 rural communities have seen their hospital close, or close its inpatient service.\1\ Although roughly half of these hospitals have continued to provide some kind of health care to their community, the remainder have not; they've become condominiums, a car wash, or more often completely abandoned. In addition to providing health care, we also know how important hospitals are to rural economies. Recent research has shown that hospital closures can lead to decreases in the size of the labor force and the population living in the community.\2\ Those hospitals that do survive have steadily gotten smaller. Rural hospitals have cut services like maternity care and home health services,\3\ and inpatient care in rural hospitals has fallen by 13 to 20 percent in the last decade,\4\ with most of this decrease driven by rural residents being increasingly likely to receive inpatient care at urban hospitals (bypassing local care).\5\ Access to specialty care is also affected. Approximately 20 percent of Americans live more than 60 minutes from a medical oncologist,\6\ and the financial burden of increased travel time reduces the use of life- saving treatments and, paradoxically, increases the cost of care; geographic barriers to care actually lead to higher costs in the long run.\7\ Rural residents who drive an hour a day - each way - for five weeks in a row to get their radiation treatment are facing fatigue of long car travel while fighting cancer. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ Rural Hospital Closures.

In 1999, the death rate in the most rural counties was 6 percent higher than it was in large urban counties; in 2019, it was 28 percent higher.\8\ Meanwhile, research led by experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that communities where a rural hospital closed saw an increase in preventable admissions.\9\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \8\ Analysis of United States Department of Health and Human Services (US DHHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Multiple Cause of Death 1999-2020 on CDC WONDER Online Data base, released 2021.

Impact of rural hospital closures on hospitalizations and associated outcomes for ambulatory and emergency care sensitive conditions. J Rural Health. 2022 May 5. https://doi.org/ 10.1111/jrh.12671. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hospitals have had weak and declining finances for years. In 2018, roughly half of rural hospitals were unprofitable, and financial distress is one of the leading causes of rural hospital closure. As hospitals close, residents face a decrease in access to health care. Facing this decline in access, Congress, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and others have often proposed new models of care that focus on a hospital's emergency department services. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 created a new type of health care provider-- the Rural Emergency Hospital (REH). This model has some appealing elements, and at this time 18 rural hospitals have officially converted to REHs, but interest has been more modest due to some program design elements that can only be addressed legislatively. I applaud Congress for acting innovatively to address rural health needs. Continued monitoring of this provider type will be necessary to ensure it is meeting the needs Congress intended. While REHs try to take root, the growth of hospital systems and consolidation continues to raise questions. Increasingly, rural hospitals are becoming part of a larger health care systems, and this can lead to further service erosion. Work by researchers out of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has found that rural hospitals that merge are more likely to close their obstetric and surgical units.\10\ Given that one study concluded female veterans may be more dependent on non-VHA providers to receive certain gender- specific services, like obstetric and gynecologic care,\11\ the erosion of these services in rural communities is especially notable. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \10\ Henke RM, Fingar KR, Jiang J, Liang L. and Gibson TB.

Over the past 20 years, it has become even more difficult to recruit, retain, and sustain rural health care workers ranging from doctors to nurses to emergency medical service (EMS) personnel in rural areas.\12\ Without an adequate health workforce, it is becoming more difficult for individuals in rural areas to access health care.\13\ Many proposed policy solutions to address these workforce challenges focus on one profession, for example nurses, or one stage of the career, such as graduate medical education. To shore up and grow the rural health workforce, it is critical that we look to solutions that aren't siloed in this fashion and support health care workers across their entire career trajectory.\14\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \12\ Rural Health Research Gateway.

Health professionals that train in rural areas are five times as likely to remain in practice in rural areas.\15\ By growing the number of rural training opportunities and then ensuring that resources are available to retain that workforce across their careers, we can ensure that the workforce needed to support rural areas is there for decades to come.\16\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \15\ Russell DJ, Wilkinson E, Petterson S, Chen C, Bazemore A.

Meanwhile, the VHA has increased the number of residency slots by 1,500, with many rural VHA facilities receiving priority for additional slots.\18\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \17\ E.g.

The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 included provisions that expand rural resident training opportunities. Section 126, for example, increased the number of physician residency slots, to be phased in over several years. To qualify, training programs must meet one of four criteria, including being located - or being treated as being located - in a rural area. Legal decisions have led to a rapid increase in the number of urban hospitals that reclassify as rural; this means that, under current legislation, they are treated as rural hospitals in all respects, including eligibility for residency slots. Despite a ten-percent floor on the number of expanded residency slots allocated to rural hospitals, only five percent of slots were allocated to hospitals located in rural areas; another 42 percent were allocated to urban hospitals that have been reclassified as rural.\19\ This may not have been Congress's intention. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \19\ Rains J, Holmes GM, Pathak S, Hawes EM.

Veterans experience certain conditions - notably, traumatic brain injury and substance use disorders - more often than their civilian counterparts.\20\ Although behavioral health remains a crisis across the country, compared to urban residents, residents living in rural areas receive less care, from providers with less specialized training, and the care they received is less likely to be innovative.\21\ This creates a particularly acute challenge for rural veterans - there are fewer health care providers to treat and manage their more prevalent behavioral health needs. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \20\ Olenick M, Flowers M, Diaz VJ.

Rural Can Innovate and Lead When Policies Are Rural-Appropriate and --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Supportive We commonly hear about rural America being sicker, poorer, and older. It is also relatively well-known rural residents are less likely to have health insurance,\22\ more likely to travel farther for health care,\23\ and more likely to have chronic diseases. The CDC found that rural residents are more likely to die of the five leading preventable causes of death.\24\ These are accurate descriptions of a population that provides much of America's food, fun, and fuel. Although accurate, I often worry that it suggests government is powerless to improve rural health. Historically, when Congress and policymakers have developed policy to address rural needs, it has led to dramatic improvements in conditions for relatively small expenditures. In the early 1990's, rural hospitals were closing at a dramatic pace, and Congress introduced the Critical Access Hospital program in 1996. That program has stabilized the rural health care system for over 1,300 rural communities. Although roughly one quarter of acute care hospitals are CAHs, the program only accounts for five percent of total hospital outlays by Medicare.\25\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \22\ Turrini G, Branham DK, Chen L, Conmy AB, Chappel AR, and De Lew N.

Telehealth, community health workers, expanded scope of practice and task shifting, drones, new payment models, and leveraging strong trust in community leaders (faith leaders, agriculture, other community organizations) are all examples where lessons from rural innovation has helped fuel transformation throughout the health care system. One word of caution, however; the pandemic saw dramatic increases in the use of telehealth, which seems particularly well-suited to the challenges described today. Telehealth-based solutions may be one promising strategy, but will not be effective for all veterans; roughly one quarter of rural veterans do not have internet in their home. Conclusion and Future Directions Although rural residents - and those who visit rural communities - face real barriers to achieving their full health potential, there are policy strategies that Congress can consider to mitigate some of the barriers. History has shown that thoughtful legislation designed to address rural-specific challenges and leverage the assets of rural America has been successful in improving the lives of the 60 million who live in our rural communities. It is important to continue to recognize that rural health care systems are different, and not simply ``small versions of urban'' and can yield similar outcomes, when given the opportunity.\26\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \26\ Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Rural-Urban Disparities in Health Care in Medicare. November 2020. https:// www.cms.gov/files/document/omh-rural-urban-report-2020.pdf Statements for the Record ---------- Prepared Statement of American Association of Nurse Anesthesiology  Prepared Statement of American Nurses Association The American Nurses Association (ANA) applauds the House Veterans' Affairs Committee for holding this oversight hearing on ``Rural Access: Is VA Meeting All Veterans Where They Live.'' As a leading voice of the nursing profession, ANA is committed to working with the U.S. House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the U.S. Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) to ensure that our nation's veterans and their families have timely access to highly qualified healthcare professionals, especially in rural and underserved communities. With this mission in mind and given how nurses provide care for VA patients on a national basis, ANA would like to respectfully share its perspective on how the VA can better serve our veterans through the issuance of national standards of practice (NSPs) for certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs). Development of National Standards of Practice The VA has been developing NSPs for various non-physician health care professionals employed at VA facilities nationwide. These standards aim to improve patients' access to care by ensuring that the delivery of healthcare by medical professionals covered by these standards are uniform throughout the VA system, regardless of what is permitted by state licensure laws. According to the VA, the development of these standards would allow the VA to ``Ensure safe, high-quality care for the Nation's Veterans. Standardize the practice of each health care occupation irrespective of State requirements. More Efficiently Allocate resources to support organizational missions to include national disasters and pandemics. (...) Leverage a modernized, mobile workforce to support rural areas and crisis response.'' \1\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ ``VA National Standards of Practice,'' The Department of Veterans Affairs, 2023. http://www.va.gov/STANDARDSOFPRACTICE/index.asp --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The VA announced their NSPs for advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) in December 2016 and extended full practice authority (FPA) to three of four APRN roles. While we are pleased that nurse practitioners (NPs), clinical nurse specialists (CNSs), and certified nurse midwives (CNMs) were granted FPA, this rule excluded CRNAs.\2\ This decision was made despite a body of evidence in support of granting FPA to CRNAs that was incorporated into the rule and its supporting documents. In fact, the VA's own Supplementary Information provided with the Rule rebuffed arguments against FPA for CRNAs and agreed with comments supporting CRNA full practice. CRNAs were not granted full FPA due to vocal opposition from the physician community, which sent 100,000 comments opposing FPA to the VA. The VA, in the final rule, acknowledged that these comments were not substantive and agreed that granting FPA to CRNAs in the VA system would not eliminate the team- based care approach to the delivery of health care. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \2\ ``Advanced Practice Registered Nurses, Final Rule'' The Department of Veterans Affairs, 2016. https://www.federalregister.gov/ documents/2016/12/14/2016-29950/advanced-practice-registered-nurses --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Anesthesiologist Shortage Anesthesiologists, and their allies, oppose FPA for CRNAs on the ground that there is no shortage of anesthesiologists practicing at the VA, which contradicts existing evidence. The American Medical Association has stated that there is a general physician shortage that is expected to worsen.\3\ While this shortage is for physicians in general, there is a shortage of anesthesiologists as well. In fact, a March 2018 report on the critical deficiencies at the Washington, DC. VA Medical Center showed that procedures are being delayed or canceled due to a lack of anesthesia staff.\4\ Furthermore, there have been reports that the VA is having trouble recruiting anesthesiologists. Specifically, 25 percent of VA facility chiefs of staff are having issues recruiting or hiring anesthesiologists. These are some examples of how our Nation's veterans are not receiving timely access to trained medical professionals. By allowing CRNAs to practice to the top of their education and training at VA facilities, the department can alleviate the healthcare professional shortage and greatly improve the care that our veterans and their families are receiving. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \3\ ``The physician shortage crisis is here - and so are bipartisan fixes'' American Medical Association http://www.ama-assn.org/practice- management/sustainability/physician-shortage-crisis-here-and-so-are- bipartisan-fixes, November 6, 2023 \4\ ``Critical Deficiencies at the Washington DC VA Medical Center,'' (Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of the Inspector General, 2018 http://www.oversight.gov/sites/default/files/oig-reports/ VAOIG-17-02644-130.pdf --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Additionally, the VA commissioned a study published by the Temple University Beasley School of Law in 2022 that concluded that policy decisions on CRNA standards should be guided by currently available data. The data provided in the study shows that removing restrictions on CRNAs would have no negative impact on patients and may also be a cost-effective solution to physician shortages and increasing access to care.\5\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \5\ ``Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist Scope of Practice Laws,'' (DeAnna Baumle, JD, MSW,2022). http://www.va.gov/ STANDARDSOFPRACTICE/docs/CRNA_PolicyBrief_Temple.pdf --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Meeting Patients Where They Live The title of the hearing asks whether the VA is meeting patients where they live. Unfortunately, the answer to this question is no. There are dire physician shortages in rural areas and APRNs are used extensively in these areas to meet the required demand of the patients. The previously referenced Temple study stated that APRNs, ``including CRNAs, are typically more accessible to historically underserved populations and geographic areas. For instance, rural facilities are more heavily reliant on CRNAs for anesthesia and surgical practices.'' Granting FPA to CRNAs at rural VA facilities would promote the VA's goal of ensuring that our veterans have access to safe, high-quality care. The VA is also trying to create a mobile workforce that can respond to emergencies and be available in areas where there are shortages. Given the lack of a national standard for CRNAs, those CRNAs employed by the VA in states that allow FPA will likely choose to stay in these states, thereby undermining efforts to expand the heath care workforce in other states. Adopting NSPs for CRNAs will allow the VA to shift these highly qualified professionals to facilities in states where they are needed without worrying about whether they will be able to practice to the top of their education and training. Conclusion In closing, our veterans and their families deserve access to the highest quality healthcare regardless of where they live. To bring this aspiration to fruition, the VA must bring an end to the current supervisory model of care for CRNAs and move toward a model where both physicians and CRNAs work independently to provide direct patient care. ANA appreciates this opportunity to share the nursing community's perspective and stands ready to partner with this committee and the VA to improve healthcare for veterans and their families in rural and underserved communities.

U.S. VETS, the leading nonprofit organization committed to the welfare of at-risk veterans and their families experiencing homelessness, is the largest provider in this sector. Our mission is to ensure a smooth transition for military veterans and their families back into civilian life, offering an array of supportive services including housing, counseling, career development, and comprehensive support. Since inception in 1993, U.S.VETS has engaged with over 179,000 veterans, provided homes for more than 57,000, and placed nearly 15,000 veterans into employment. I am privileged to present this statement on behalf of U.S.VETS in Prescott, Arizona, and the veterans in rural communities they serve at the oversight hearing of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs on January 11, 2024. Since opening in 2003, U.S.VETS--Prescott has been a critical resource in Arizona, providing housing and comprehensive services to over 8,500 veterans in the past 21 years. In Arizona, particularly within Yavapai County where Prescott is located, challenges are pronounced due to the rural setting. The county, with a population density of only twenty-six people per square mile and 11 percent of whom are veterans, faces unique challenges. The cost of housing here is significantly high, 42 percent above the national average. Furthermore, the Northern Arizona VA Healthcare System, covering a vast area of 65,000 square miles, includes regions with some of the highest rates of veteran suicides in Arizona from 2015 to 2022. During the 2021 point- in-time count, over 15 percent of individuals in Arizona's homeless shelters were identified as veterans. At U.S.VETS--Prescott, the team confronts these challenges daily. Despite the Veterans Affairs' (VA) advancements in providing care and benefits, significant obstacles remain. These include difficulties in travel, inadequate funding for homeless veterans, and a lack of affordable housing. The VA's Community Based Outreach Clinics (CBOCs), although beneficial, do not fully address the vast distances and transportation challenges inherent to rural environments, nor do they comprehensively address the complex health issues faced by many veterans. The existing grant and per diem rates for homeless veterans are insufficient, failing to reflect the actual costs of service provision in these areas. One of the major barriers for rural veterans in Prescott is transportation, as there is no public transportation system. U.S.VETS-- Prescott offers three scheduled van trips daily to the VA and healthcare providers over one hundred miles away in Phoenix and other outlying areas. This service is crucial for veterans who would otherwise be unable to access necessary care due to distance and transportation challenges. U.S.VETS--Prescott's onsite services are comprehensive. They provide three meals daily along with snacks, case management, employment assistance, transportation, career development, individual and group counseling, and housing navigation. The organization offers six different housing interventions, including emergency shelter, transitional housing, long-term supportive housing, housing for frail elderly, transition in place, rapid rehousing, and specialized housing for veterans who are victims of military sexual assault. In addition to these services, U.S.VETS--Prescott contracts with local community providers to offer unique therapies often inaccessible to veterans, such as equine therapy, acupuncture, biofeedback, and CNA care for elderly veterans. These therapies are vital for veterans who lack financial and transportation resources to access specialized care. In September 2023, U.S.VETS--Prescott opened the Veteran Connection Hub in Prescott, focusing on suicide prevention among veterans. The Hub offers a range of support services, including counseling, support groups, access to mental health professionals, and benefits counseling. Their approach is proactive and preventative, focusing on early intervention and resilience-building strategies. Moreover, U.S.VETS--Prescott annually hosts a 2-day Stand Down event, bringing together over thirty-five providers from various sectors, including the local health department, motor vehicle services, VA, Department of Economic Security, and other community service organizations. 185 veterans were assisted at this event in 2023. This event serves as a one-stop resource for veterans, offering a range of services in one location. Notably, the Stand Down event also includes a full-day veteran court, which has proven highly effective, with over forty veterans having their cases resolved in a single day. U.S.VETS--Prescott's collaboration with the Northern Arizona VA Healthcare System is multifaceted and enhances their service delivery. This partnership provides the flexibility to tailor programs to fill gaps in services that the VA may not cover, including specialized programs and support services designed to address the specific challenges faced by the veteran community. Additionally, their collaboration with the VA ensures a smooth transition for veterans requiring services through the VA, reducing bureaucratic hurdles and delays, and providing veterans with timely and efficient access to a wide range of resources and support. U.S.VETS--Prescott is more than just a service provider; it is a community dedicated to supporting veterans in every aspect of their lives. However, the sustainability of their work is challenged by the low per diem rates, which are incongruent with the escalating costs due to inflation and the growing complexity of the needs of the veterans they assist. U.S.VETS has been a strong advocate of H.R. 3848, the HOME Act, and requests your strong advocacy with the Senate to pass this bill which will bring per diem rates in line with actual expenditures, particularly in rural areas, that will help them better serve veterans in rural areas. U.S.VETS--Prescott believes in a collaborative approach with federal, state, and local entities, along with veteran service organizations, to develop effective solutions. Their goal is to ensure that every veteran has equitable access to the care and benefits they deserve. U.S.VETS--Prescott looks forward to working with the Committee on Veterans' Affairs and other stakeholders to enhance support and access for rural veterans.

The Association and AIM thank the Committee for its continued leadership on issues, such as rural health care access, that are important to our nation's veterans living with Alzheimer's and other dementia and their caregivers. This statement highlights the importance of dementia care and support programs at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and discusses how our nation's veterans living with dementia are benefiting from such programs. Founded in 1980, the Alzheimer's Association is the world's leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care, support, and research. Our mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's and other dementia through the advancement of research; to provide and enhance care and support for all affected, and to reduce the risk of dementia through the promotion of brain health. AIM is the Association's advocacy affiliate, working in a strategic partnership to make Alzheimer's a national priority. Together, the Alzheimer's Association and AIM advocate for policies to fight Alzheimer's disease, including increased investment in research, improved care and support, and the development of approaches to reduce the risk of developing dementia. Nearly half a million American veterans have Alzheimer's--and as the population ages, that number is expected to grow. In 2015, an estimated 486,000 veterans were living with Alzheimer's. The annual number of veterans newly diagnosed with dementia has increased by more than 22 percent since 2008. For veterans, the prevalence may grow even faster in future years because they have a higher risk of developing dementia. The significant increase in the number of veterans with Alzheimer's and other dementias will place a heavy burden on the VA health care system, and in particular, rural health practices. Rural communities often face higher prevalence rates of dementia due to risk factors such as an aging population, limited access to healthcare services, and socioeconomic challenges. And, while the Committee develops policy proposals in this space, we ask that you take into consideration that the rate of Alzheimer's and dementia among veterans continues to increase, and so does the need for well-trained physicians in dementia and cognitive care. The United States will have to nearly triple the number of geriatricians to effectively care for the number of people projected to have Alzheimer's in 2050, while efforts to increase recruitment and retention remain slow. From 2016 to 2026, the demand for direct care workers is projected to grow by more than 40 percent, while their availability is expected to decline. Meanwhile, veterans with dementia are 2.6 times more likely to be hospitalized than other veterans--and hospital stays are, on average, 2.4 times longer. Not only do longer hospital stays add to the great financial toll dementia has on families, but this can also prove burdensome for rural hospitals with limited bed space and providers. While we are deeply grateful for the VA's comprehensive approach to dementia and the people it affects, more can always be done to ensure veterans are better able to receive high-quality care in rural areas. VA's Continued Role in Addressing Alzheimer's Disease in Rural Areas We are grateful for the VA's participation in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services, which plays a key role in developing and annually updating the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease - as set forth by the National Alzheimer's Project Act (P.L. 111-375). The National Plan is a roadmap of strategies and actions of how HHS and its partners can accelerate research, expand treatments, improve care, support people living with dementia and their caregivers, and encourage action to reduce risk factors The most recent update to the Plan was released in December 2023, and includes a number of highlights on VA's continued work to better serve our nation's veterans living with dementia. VA continues to collaborate with federal agencies on a number of the key goals of the National Plan detailing rural health care, including Action 2.A.1 to educate health care providers on Alzheimer's disease. The VA's Geriatric Scholars Program is a workforce development program to infuse geriatrics into VA primary care settings by conducting intensive training in geriatrics, including rural interdisciplinary team training. The program includes an intensive workshop in quality improvement and each participating Scholar initiates a local quality improvement project to demonstrate learning and improve care or clinic efficiency. The program also includes a wide variety of training activities focused on dementia, including training sessions on dementia caregiver coordinator education and rural caregiver education. Finally, the program provides participants with hands-on experience and practical skills in geriatric care necessary for adequately treating the aging population. We also ask that the Committee continue to support the Veterans Health Administration's 20 Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Centers (GRECCs), which are geriatric centers of excellence focused on aging. GRECCs reported in the 2023 National Plan Update that their work included 78 research grants in dementia covering basic science to clinical care and health services research and 25 clinical innovation projects that directly served veterans with dementia and their families. GRECC faculty have developed numerous clinical programs to aid family members and care providers including e-Consults for Behaviors in Dementia, Health Care Directives for Veterans with Dementia, Reaching Out to Rural Caregivers and Veterans with Dementia Utilizing Clinical Video-Telehealth and Virtual Dementia Caregiver Support Programs. The GRECC Program produced 56 educational programs for staff and trainees on best practices in dementia care, including the use of simulation technology to demonstrate techniques for communication and facilitating ADLs for veterans with dementia. Finally, GRECC authors published 259 manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals in Fiscal Year 2022 on their research and clinical work in dementia. VA must continue supporting the GRECCs in disseminating findings from this research to integrate scientifically proven dementia interventions into local and rural communities. The VA also continues to collaborate with the Indian Health Service (IHS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the National Plan Action 2.A.6 to strengthen the ability of primary care teams in Indian country to meet the needs of people with Alzheimer's and related dementias and their caregivers. For example, in 2022 the IHS launched the Indian Health GeriScholars Pilot, developed with the support and collaboration of the VA Office of Rural Health. Modeled after the VA Geriatric Scholars Program, the Indian Health GeriScholars pilot is providing primary care clinicians at IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian Organization health programs with an individual intensive learning track for professional continuing education. These are only a few examples of ways in which the VA remains involved in working to ensure a high-quality, well-trained dementia care workforce, and continue bridging the gap in cognitive services in rural areas. The National Alzheimer's Project Act as a whole has led to great achievements in the treatment and research of Alzheimer's disease; however, this important law expires soon. The bipartisan NAPA Reauthorization Act (H.R. 619/S. 133) and Alzheimer's Accountability and Investment Act (H.R. 620/S. 134) would extend the National Plan, and ensure researchers at NIH continue to receive the funding necessary to sustain vital Alzheimer's and dementia research. These bills will ensure the nation continues addressing Alzheimer's as a national priority, providing continuity for the community. Program for Advancing Cognitive Disorders Education for Rural Staff (PACERS) The VA Employee Education System and South Central Mental Illness Research Education and Clinical Center administer the Program for Advancing Cognitive Disorders Education for Rural Staff, also known as PACERS. The PACERS program at the VA is designed to enhance dementia care through a specialized training program for clinicians who care for veterans with cognitive disorders. It aims to improve outcomes for veterans and their caregivers, especially those living in rural communities. The program includes six e-learning courses and five videos that focus on normal cognitive aging and dementia caregiving, addressing decision-making and safety in dementia, and reviewing case studies in treating dementia. In rural settings with limited resources, the PACERS program is a crucial tool for healthcare professionals to better provide dementia patients with high-quality care within the constraints of rural healthcare infrastructure. The VA may consider adopting similar online programs to further enhance dementia care training for rural physicians at the Veterans Health Administration. Conclusion The Alzheimer's Association and AIM appreciate the Committee's steadfast support for veterans and their caregivers and the continued commitment to advancing issues important to the millions of military families affected by Alzheimer's and other dementia. We look forward to working with the Committee and other Members of Congress in a bipartisan way to advance policies that will ensure access to high- quality dementia care and support in rural areas, especially as the population of veterans living with dementia continues to grow. Prepared Statement of American Society of Anesthesiologists  Prepared Statement of John Mikelson Chairman Bost , Ranking Member Takano, and distinguished members of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs - thank you for inviting me to submit this written statement for the record of today's hearing on rural health care provided by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) within the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). I have looked at the VA's data and there are 4.4 million rural and highly rural Veterans with 2.7 million enrolled in VA. 61 percent of rural Veterans are enrolled in the VA health care system; a significantly higher rate than the 41 percent enrollment rate of urban Veterans. I appreciate your attention to this topic and am pleased to share my perspective. I love the Iowa City VA Health Care System. I get all my care there since 2004 and have a great relationship with their leadership and staff. However there are a few rough spots. Appointment Travel The Beneficiary Travel Self Service System (BTSS) is difficult to operate especially for non computer literate elderly. In my experience, BTSS assumes that all veterans are computer savvy, and have access, to computers. 27 percent of rural veterans do not access the internet at home according to the VA's own Rural Health page. Often times veterans give up applying for a benefit that is rightfully theirs because the VA removed the most accurate and available resources, which was the convenient Kiosks located in the VA Hospitals main corridor to be used to check in for appointments and file for travel the veterans were attending their appointments. I don't why they were removed. Recreational Therapy Iowa City VA HCS only has 1 Recreational Therapist, and she is only associated with the inpatient mental health unit. She is not associated with the VA's National Disabled Veterans Golf Clinic held locally each September; the Golf For Injured Veterans Everywhere (GIVE); nor does she have time to assist with other National VA therapy programs like coordinating local entries for the VA's National Creative Arts Festival. How can we best connect rural Veterans with others to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Other VA Hospitals in more urban locations offer more activities for socialization through sports recreation or creative expression. Telehealth I truly believe in the importance of telehealth and asks that you continue to leverage its benefits for the veteran community. I live in Louisa County. We do not have a single Red/Amber/Green Stoplight in the entire county. No paid firefighters or EMTs. We depend on surrounding areas for support. The Iowa City VA is a good 40 minute drive. Rural Veterans enrolled in VA's health care system are also significantly older: 55 percent are over the age of 65. Telehealth and telemedicine services should be expanded to improve access to care, especially for veterans in remote areas. Telehealth enables virtual consultations, remote monitoring, and the delivery of healthcare services, reducing the need for veterans to travel long distances for appointments. While telehealth has been critical to expanding access to health care services; telehealth cannot simply replace in-person service delivery. Patients, in consultation with their providers, must be able to choose whether telehealth or in-person services are most appropriate for their needs. Outside of VA, some health plans have implemented strategies to limit consumers' options by offering ``telehealth only'' or ``telehealth first'' coverage, which bars or limits access to in- person care. For individuals who need a higher level of outpatient care, residential care, or inpatient care to treat their MH/SUD condition(s), a ``telehealth only'' option can negatively impact treatment options, further delay an appropriate level of care, and can be a significant financial barrier if individuals find they must pay out-of-pocket for additional services. Even when telehealth is available, however, the 3-4G network is spotty across Iowa and 5G is only available in major Metro areas. Public resources can help, but there is a lack of public video access points including the Iowa Workforce Development terminals in libraries and National Guard Readiness Centers. While these are State owned systems for employment but they could be cross purposed for telehealth. I understand that is a state issue but can Congress empower the VHA to coordinate resources in joint State/Federal buildings? Not all veterans have a computer, my self included, or an adequate Wi-Fi connection to VA. VA software is not always compatible with off the shelf platforms. My physical therapist had to go to Zoom because my phone could not handle the VA platform. I ask your support of the telehealth provisions in S. 1315, the Veterans Health Empowerment, Access, Leadership, and Transparency for our Heroes Act of 2023, and H.R. 3520, the Veteran Care Improvement Act of 2023. Both bills include measures that would require VA to discuss telehealth options for care, both at VA and in the community, if telehealth is available, appropriate, and acceptable to the veteran. Congress should continue to work with VA and other stakeholders to ensure that the necessary balance is found between the efficiencies of telehealth and veteran preference. Women Veterans OB care is still lacking. The Veterans Affairs Medical Centers are understaffed in the OB/Gyn field, so are the rural communities. Seeking Care in the Community is often hard find. Due in part to Mercy Hospital going under and being purchased by University Of Iowa Hospital and Clinics, high malpractice cost and restrictions on women's health care, some of those OB/Gyn resources have left the area. This is certainly not the VA's fault but many young veterans do their initial tour of Duty and get out to go to college or start a family. Those 22-30 year olds are in their prime child bearing years. I ask that this subcommittee continue expanding resources for our female veterans and support the recommendations of the Woman's Veterans Task Force. Mental Health Mental health bed space is in short supply across the Midwest. Not just in the VHA system but across the board. Iowa has been short since the facility in Knoxville closed years ago and has not been able to replace them. Wait times for admission persist. We need to incentivize careers in Mental Health fields to ensure veterans can get timely access to the help they need when they need it rather than when it's available. To be clear, there is no shortage of VA programs nationally to support veterans and their families, but not enough mental heath beds. However, in that abundance, many in this population remain confused by the number and types of VA services, employee roles in their delivery, and eligibility criteria. Veterans and the general public cannot discern between what is a County or State issue versus VHA or VBA territory much less a concern for Big VA. For having no Active Duty installations in Iowa, we do a pretty fair job differentiating the Marines from the Air Force from the Army National Guard or Navy Reserves. We need to do a better job of promoting VHA services and eligibility. More than 301,000 rural Veterans served in Iraq and Afghanistan. When I retired in 2004 from Active Duty (Title 32 AGR) and was granted a 60 percent VA Disability Rating I went to a county veteran services office and was told they could not assist me since I was National Guard and ineligible for VA Health Care. He just didn't know any better. That County has since hired a much more knowledgeable CVSO and the State now requires each County to have a VA Certified Service Officer. But, the misconceptions persist in the community and among service members past or present. On a positive note there exist a Recovery in Action group at the Iowa City HCS the includes Mental Health Inpatient staff, Outpatient staff, Suicide Prevention Team, the Vets Center, VR&E, Iowa Workforce, University of Iowa Veterans staff, the local NAMI Chapter and other community resources to ensure there is no wrong door for care. The Cedar Rapids Vet Center has a Mobile Office (A converted camper) that travels to surrounding counties and veterans events and does have telehealth capabilities. I would love to see more of these community integration efforts to bring the VHA to the rural communities as the VA does not exist in a vacuum. CLOSING I would like to thank the House Committee on Veteran Affairs its distinguished members for inviting me to submit this statement. I am grateful for your attention and efforts to ensure that veterans receive the best possible care and outcomes through the Veterans Health Administration, particularly through well-coordinated care. I am greatly appreciative of this opportunity to share my experience and perspective with you all today. I look forward to continuing to work with you on these issues and am standing by to assist in any way I can toward our shared goal of serving those that have served this country.
