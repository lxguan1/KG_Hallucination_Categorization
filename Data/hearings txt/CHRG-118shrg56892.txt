GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY
----------
WEDNESDAY, MARCH 6, 2024
U.S. Senate,
Committee on Foreign Relations,
Washington, DC.
The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:04 a.m., in
room SD-419, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Benjamin L.
Cardin, chairman of the committee, presiding.
Present: Senators Cardin , Shaheen, Coons,
Murphy, Kaine, Booker, Van Hollen, Risch, Ricketts, and Young.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BENJAMIN L. CARDIN,
U.S. SENATOR FROM MARYLAND
The Chairman. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will
come to order.
This hearing deals with the conflict and climate change
that are driving our global security issues, so I want to thank
our witnesses for this food security hearing.
Today more people are desperate to find the next meal. More
families are choosing to migrate in search of food. More
children are going to sleep hungry.
According to the World Food Programme, 47 million people
are living on the edge of famine and 333 million are facing
crisis levels of hunger.
In recent years food insecurity has been at its highest
level since World War II. This is not isolated to one country
or one continent.
From Burma to Ukraine, from Haiti to Syria, conflict and
violence keep people from getting enough to eat. The
humanitarian crisis in Gaza is dire and getting worse.
I have said this before. We need to be more aid to the
innocent Palestinians. We need to deliver it safely and
quickly. I welcome the Administration and our allies taking new
steps to alleviate suffering through air drops. But air drops
alone are simply not enough.
Of course, it is not just war that is creating this global
crisis. The effects of climate change are devastating the
world's food supply. Fresh water and cultivable lands are
scarcer, and they are fewer in recent years.
Extreme weather events like the severe flooding we saw in
Pakistan in 2022 have destroyed millions of acres of farmland
around the globe. We cannot isolate ourselves from this crisis,
and yet last year the World Food Programme faced a 60 percent
funding shortfall, the largest in its history.
I want to thank Senator Coons, who is continuously bringing
these attentions to all of us, the need for additional
resources, and he has an incredibly difficult challenge
considering the limits that have been placed on the
appropriation bill that he is the chair of, and I thank him
again for his advocacy on behalf of these issues.
This shortfall has meant cutting food rations in the most
desperate places in the world, and when people go hungry
instability often follows. I believe strongly as many of my
colleagues and both parties do as well that food security is a
human right.
It is important as democratic governance in preserving
stability and security. That is why it is in the U.S. national
security interest to solve the climate crisis.
I am pleased that the Biden administration has made food
security a priority. It is critical we support programs like
Feed the Future, the U.S. Government's global hunger and food
security initiative, and the vision for adapted crops and
soils.
We need to incorporate state of the art forecasting data to
understand threats and changes to food security. Our nation
must continue to take the leadership role, which is why it is
critical we get this supplemental security funding passed,
including food assistance for millions of people.
The supplemental includes so many important areas, but one
of the most important areas is the humanitarian assistance that
was included in the supplemental that passed the Senate.
Across the American political divide you can see an
interest in stepping up with critical food aid. But even as we
race to get people food before they go hungry we must recognize
that solving the global food insecurity means making serious
long term investments, strengthening food systems and
resilience of growers around the world, getting American
generated climate models and forecasts to communities in the
Global South so they can plan for the changing environment,
helping America's land grant universities and agricultural
research centers playing a larger role, and working with the
international community to take up innovation and accelerate
approaches that we know work.
Thanks to the generosity of American farmers we are saving
lives around the world. I believe American action will inspire
other nations and the international community to do more. We
all must do more.
So I want to thank our witnesses for appearing before us
today to give us their valuable help in what we can do to
alleviate this crisis. I hope that you can give us the insight
on how to best tackle this problem.
It is now my pleasure to recognize the distinguished
ranking member, Senator Risch.
STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES E. RISCH,
U.S. SENATOR FROM IDAHO
Senator Risch. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for
those kind remarks. I, too, would want to recognize the good
work that Senator Coons is doing in this area.
Our last hearing on global food security was in July 2022,
5 months after Putin began his brutal war against Ukraine and
his attempt to starve the world into submission.
Despite strong efforts to combat this, the overall state of
global food insecurity has not improved. Seven hundred and
eighty-three million people around the globe suffer from food
shortage. Three hundred and thirty-three million people are
facing acute food insecurity. An estimated 47 million people
are on the brink of famine.
These are not just statistics; these are actual people.
Congress appropriates billions of dollars annually to respond
to emergencies through life saving programs, including Food for
Peace and Emergency Food Security Program.
This money also supports initiatives to help communities
grow their own way out of poverty and become more resilient to
food shocks like Russia's war in Ukraine, price spikes, COVID,
earthquakes, and hurricanes. These are important programs that
we are currently operating.
Unfortunately, we spend too much time fighting to resource
these programs and too little time on maximizing their impact.
For example, after nearly 70 years of Food for Peace, we
still cannot decide its principal purpose. Is it to feed hungry
people or to ensure that one U.S. company operating the three
bulk carriers available for U.S. food aid deliveries has a big
enough subsidy?
The inability or unwillingness to resolve this leads to
higher costs and lower impact. It also drives well intentioned
advocates to push new legislative ideas or workarounds that
only add more layers of bureaucracy and undermine efficiency.
Let us be clear. Congress will never appropriate its way
out of this current global food security crisis. We need to do
better with what we have got.
First and foremost, countries receiving aid must do more to
address the drivers of food insecurity within their own
borders. This includes resolving conflicts, governing justly,
combating corruption, and removing the barriers that impede
economic growth and trade.
Humanitarian groups also need to do their part, and they
need to improve targeting and oversight so they can ensure aid
is getting where it is needed. They must do more to protect aid
from being diverted by armed groups, criminals, governments, or
the implementers themselves.
Wide scale adoption of technology that can improve
targeting and verification including biometrics is long
overdue. On the development side we need to work more closely
with the private sector to bring innovations to scale.
I recently saw an Idaho based company, Semilla Nueva, won a
USAID grant to enhance the quality and adoption of biofortified
maize in Latin America. We should see more of this type of
collaboration.
I would like to hear from our witnesses how they intend to
make partnering with the U.S. Government easier so we can more
effectively leverage the ingenuity of U.S. farmers and
agricultural experts.
We have got the best food producers in the world, and we
have got the tools. Let us use them to full advantage. The
challenges are immense, but the imperative is clear. The United
States can and must lead the way in promoting global food
security.
I look forward to hearing your thoughts on how we do that
more efficiently and effectively.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
The Chairman. Senator Risch, I just really want to thank
you for those opening comments. I agree we need to look for
more efficient ways to deal with the scarce resources that are
available. We will never have enough resources to meet all the
needs, and we have to figure out how to do that in the most
efficient way.
And your point about good governance is absolutely
essential as part of the solution to these problems, and this
is the Senate Foreign Relations Committee--diplomacy is
absolutely critical to avoid conflict--which also deals with
these issues. So I appreciate very much the manner of your
opening statement.
Well, we have two very distinguished witnesses.
I want to welcome both of you to the committee. Your full
statements will be made part of our record, without objection,
and you will have 5 minutes to summarize your comments, and we
will then get engaged in a question and answer format.
We will start with Ms. Dina Esposito. She is the assistant
to the administrator of USAID's Bureau of Resilience,
Environment, and Food Security. She also serves as Feed the
Future deputy coordinator for development and USAID's global
food crisis coordinator.
She has demonstrated a deep commitment to helping those
impacted by food insecurity throughout her career. Previously
she served as the director of USAID's Office of Food for Peace,
which she managed the delivery of life saving food assistance
across the globe.
She also worked with Mercy Corps where she guided food
security and economic development in over 40 countries. Quite a
record.
I also want to welcome Dr. Cary Fowler who is the
Department of State special envoy for global food security.
Throughout his career Dr. Fowler has been at the forefront in
integral achievements in agricultural development.
He has worked extensively with the U.N.'s food and
agriculture organization and is the founder of the Svalbard
Global Seed Vault, a facility that I had the opportunity to
visit, above the Arctic Circle.
That is a landmark achievement for global food security
that holds the world's largest collection of agricultural
biodiversity.
As special envoy Dr. Fowler has spearheaded the vision for
adapted crops and soil, a program that works in partnership
with the FAO and the African Union to address food security
through the cultivation of healthy soils and diverse climate
resilient crops.
We will start with Ms. Esposito.
STATEMENT OF DINA ESPOSITO, ASSISTANT TO THE ADMINISTRATOR,
BUREAU FOR RESILIENCE, ENVIRONMENT, AND FOOD SECURITY, U.S.
AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, WASHINGTON, DC
Ms. Esposito. Thank you, Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member
Risch, and the distinguished members of the committee, so many
of you longtime champions for the world's hungry and
impoverished.
I also want to thank Special Envoy Fowler for his focus on
strengthening indigenous food production through his vision for
adapted crops and soil.
After more than a decade of progress fighting chronic
hunger and malnutrition after the 2009 global food crisis a
series of unprecedented shocks have reversed many of our gains
including COVID-19, Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine, ongoing
conflicts in Sudan, Ethiopia, Yemen, and now Gaza, and
unprecedented consecutive droughts, most notably in the Horn.
This miserable confluence means that today 735 million
people are chronically hungry. Every night they go to bed
hungry because they cannot afford enough to eat. That is 120
million more than in 2019 pre-COVID.
One hundred and forty million people in the most vulnerable
countries are acutely hungry. They are victims of conflict or
compound crises that have upended their livelihoods, and they
must depend on humanitarian assistance to survive. That number
is twice as high as it was in 2019.
Nevertheless, the committee and every American should know
their generosity has kept millions of people off the knife's
edge.
At the height of the global food crisis in 2022, USAID was
able to provide nearly $20 billion in humanitarian assistance,
of which $6 billion was for emergency food assistance.
Beyond making our dollars stretch further in emergency
situations we must continue investments that we know prevent
hunger in the first place, investments that have had meaningful
success.
In the areas where Feed the Future, the U.S. Government's
signature global hunger initiative, has worked poverty, hunger,
and child stunting all declined by 20 to 25 percent in its
first decade of work.
But we do not rest on these results. When Congress took the
extraordinary measure of providing an additional $1 billion in
supplemental funds to Feed the Future in 2022, a doubling of
our annual budget and the first increase in funding since 2009,
we undertook a massive effort to harness Feed the Future to
feed the present.
As food prices hit record highs following Putin's invasion
of Ukraine we rushed to get high quality seeds, fertilizer, and
financing to the markets and into the hands of some of the
world's poorest farmers, helping absorb the worst effects of
the food crisis by strengthening local production.
This complement to humanitarian assistance was a critically
important decision made by the U.S. Congress. The national
security supplemental passed by this chamber last month
includes $50 million to prevent and respond to global food
insecurity.
As the House, hopefully, takes up this critical package of
assistance for our allies, it is important that humanitarian
and development assistance remain a key component alongside
security assistance.
To make every dollar stretch farther we are working harder
than ever to leverage private sector investment with our
limited development dollars, crowding in $700 million of
private capital in 2022.
By tapping into the expertise and supply chains of
companies like JR Simplot from Idaho or McCormick's Spices in
Maryland we are helping open new markets for American
businesses and smallholder farmers at the same time.
We also partner to generate and scale innovation with a
special focus on women, who often comprise the majority of
farmers where we work and yet lack access to the same
information and services as men.
These efforts connect us to 70 partners in the United
States across 42 States and 16 innovation labs, and we are
doubling down on Feed the Future's core mandate, which is to
concentrate bilateral investments in several countries that we
know are most in need and best poised for regional agricultural
led economic growth.
Already we have identified a subset of Feed the Future
target countries in southern Africa that with adequate
investment we feel could give rise to a new regional
breadbasket for the continent.
While we are heartened by the progress we have made and
optimistic about what our reforms will yield, we should again
be clear eyed about the circumstances the world faces.
A strong El Nino weather pattern has fueled weather
disruptions that are spiking needs in some parts of the world.
Just last week Zambia declared a national emergency following a
month without rainfall, and in Gaza the entire population, from
some 2.2 million people, is facing at least crisis levels of
acute hunger.
Administrator Power just returned from the region where she
joined President Biden, Secretary Blinken, and other
administration officials in continuing to stress the importance
of expanded humanitarian access as part of an overall sustained
effort to scale up the amount of lifesaving aid we are getting
into Gaza.
After decades of progress the downturn in global food
security and nutrition security is, indeed, concerning. But the
truth is without American leadership and continued bipartisan
support it would be far worse.
Looking forward, bending the hunger curve downward will
require us to better anticipate rather than only react to
future shocks and continue to make long term agricultural
investments, enhancing our own economic well being and
fostering a safer and more secure world in the process.
Thank you for your continued partnership, and I look
forward to your questions.

Prepared Statement of Ms. Dina Esposito
Thank you, Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Risch, and the
distinguished members of the Committee, so many of you long-time
champions for the world's hungry and impoverished. I also want to thank
Special Envoy Fowler for his focus on strengthening indigenous food
production. I've prepared an opening statement, but my full testimony
has been shared with the Committee for the record.
We should be honest about the state of global food insecurity
today. After more than a decade of progress fighting chronic hunger and
malnutrition following the last global food crisis in 2009--progress
spurred in meaningful part by Feed the Future, the United States
signature global hunger effort--a series of unprecedented shocks have
reversed many of our gains. These shocks include: The COVID-19
pandemic; Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine; ongoing conflicts in
Sudan, Ethiopia, Yemen, and now Gaza, among so many other hotspots; and
unprecedented consecutive droughts, most notably in the Horn of Africa.
The confluence of these events means that today, 735 million people
are chronically hungry--every night before they go to bed because they
can't afford enough to eat. That's 120 million more people than in
2019, pre-COVID.
One hundred and forty million people in the most vulnerable
countries are acutely hungry--they are victims of conflict or crises
that have upended their livelihoods, and now are severely malnourished
and must depend on humanitarian assistance to survive. That number is
twice as high as it was in 2019.
But even in the face of such stark numbers, all of you on this
committee and every American taxpayer should know that American
generosity has kept hundreds of millions of people off the knife's
edge.
The United States has maintained its role as the world's leader in
providing both acute and development food assistance. In fiscal year
2023, we provided over $14.2 billion in total humanitarian assistance,
of which $3 billion was emergency food assistance to 134 million people
in 58 countries. That includes sending American-grown agricultural
commodities like wheat, sorghum, and rice overseas--critical in
emergencies when crops have failed and markets have gone bare. It also
includes market-based assistance which is a more efficient way to help
those in places where markets still function, but livelihoods have been
destroyed.
This lifesaving work would not have been possible without the
continued generosity and foresight of Congress in appropriating
emergency supplemental funds. At the height of the global food crisis
in fiscal year 2022, USAID was able to provide nearly $20 billion in
humanitarian assistance, of which $6 billion was for emergency food
assistance. Additionally, Congress also supported our decision to draw
down the full balance of the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust. The
Senate's recent passage of the National Security Supplemental
appropriations bill which includes $9.15 billion in humanitarian
assistance is critical, and we urge the House to follow your lead.
Without these resources, we face a 52 percent shortfall as compared to
fiscal year 2022 in appropriated humanitarian resources, at a time when
needs are increasing.
I wish I could say that other donors would likely step up in our
absence, but globally we are seeing humanitarian budgets contracting,
especially as many European nations shift their resources to support
incoming Ukrainian refugees. When it comes to the fate of those in the
world's most dire conditions, it is America that leads.
But our response to greater humanitarian need cannot simply be to
call for more resources. We must also take two critical steps.
First, we must make every American taxpayer dollar we spend as
efficient and effective as possible. Every 5 years, this country has a
chance to strengthen our U.S. food assistance programs through the
reauthorization of the Farm Bill. Ten years ago, I helped support the
bipartisan effort that gave USAID critical flexibility to make our food
assistance dollars stretch further. As Congress negotiates the
reauthorization this year, it is critical that we maintain and expand
those flexibilities--for instance, granting authorities to make using
US commodities in non-emergency programs an option rather than a
requirement--without decreasing overall commodity procurement levels
for the program. Doing so will allow partners to design activities that
most improve livelihoods and agricultural productivity so poor
communities can better withstand shocks without the chronic need for
emergency food aid.
I want to be very clear: This does not mean cutting the level of US
commodities we send, but simply allocating them to emergency response
where they are the most appropriate. These may sound like minor,
technical adjustments, but they will save lives, save money and benefit
American farmers and taxpayers.
Second, beyond making our dollars stretch further in short-term
emergency situations, we must continue investments resilience efforts
that we know can prevent hunger, before it is dire starvation. If we
can help countries and communities better anticipate shocks that drive
hunger and enhance their capacity to grow more food and sustain their
livelihoods no matter what comes, then we can greatly reduce the need
for humanitarian assistance. This is supported by clear evidence,
research from Ethiopia, Kenya, and Madagascar found that for every
dollar invested in resilience, we save between $2.50 to $7 in
humanitarian assistance.
This is what the United States has done across decades in places
like Korea, Mexico, Brazil, and India--countries that once were our
largest recipients of food aid but now count amongst our largest trade
partners. When Feed the Future was launched in 2010, its goal was to
continue that legacy: To tap into the know-how of America's farmers,
crop researchers, and agribusinesses to spur agricultural
transformation in the countries with highest potential for growth in
Latin America, Asia, and Africa.
And we've had meaningful success. In the areas where Feed the
Future worked, poverty, hunger, and child stunting all declined by 20-
25 percent in its first decade of work, outpacing results seen in non-
Feed the Future peer countries. Children's diets improved. Women played
a greater, more empowered role in their households and their economies.
Agricultural sales doubled every year since the Initiative began. And
these results held, even in places beset by disasters, or where
populations grew rapidly.
But we did not rest on these results. When Congress took the
extraordinary measure of providing an additional $1 billion in
supplemental funds to Feed the Future efforts in 2022--a doubling of
our annual budget and the first and only increase in funding since
2008--we undertook a massive effort to harness Feed the Future to
``feed the present.'' As food prices hit record highs following Putin's
invasion of Ukraine, we rushed to get high-quality seeds, fertilizer,
and financing to the markets and into the hands of some of the world's
poorest farmers. By helping keep these markets open and prices down, we
helped absorb the worst effects of the food crisis by strengthening
local production.
This complement to humanitarian assistance--providing USAID with
supplemental resources to keep farmers planting and the services they
rely on running at a time of crisis--was a critically important
congressional decision. Using the Feed the Future development platform
to respond to future shocks--alongside emergency food assistance--is
one of the critical reforms we're embracing to strengthen and evolve
the initiative and advance global food security objectives. The
National Security Supplemental passed by this chamber last month
included $50 million in funds to prevent and respond to global food
insecurity. As the House hopefully takes up this critical package of
assistance for our allies, it is important that humanitarian and
development assistance remain key components alongside security
assistance.
We're also doubling down on our partnerships with the private
sector, through which we crowded-in almost $700 million in private
dollars in 2022. By tapping into the expertise and supply chains of
companies like JR Simplot Company, McCormick Spices, and Walmart, we
are helping open new markets for American businesses and global farmers
at the same time. And by using public funds to ``de-risk'' the flow of
private capital to small- and medium agribusinesses in Africa, rather
than providing just grants, with the support of Congress, our new
Financing Agricultural Small-and-Medium Enterprises in Africa (FASA)
fund will catalyze up to a fivefold match by private financiers.
We're harnessing the latest technologies to bring innovation to the
field to have more impactful results and help farmers decide how much
fertilizer to apply. We are partnering with NASA and others to harness
geospatial imaging to automatically trigger needed insurance payments,
if weather patterns shift. Through our partnership universities, like
with Pennsylvania State University, where we're harnessing AI to help
farmers rapidly identify and addressing crop diseases and new pests; as
well as bringing water pumps and drip irrigation systems to areas
buffeted by droughts. We're also using the latest in genomics and lab
techniques to develop climate resilient seeds and promote soil health.
Today, no less than 15 percent of our budget is dedicated to research,
much of it in U.S-based innovation labs, an effort strengthened by
Special Envoy Fowler's Vision for Adapted Crops and Soils.
We're also focusing investments on women farmers who we know do
most of the work, yet have the least access to quality seeds and
inputs, and suffer the most when crisis strikes their fields. Women-
managed farms are 24 percent less productive than male-managed farms of
the same size, and women earn 82 cents for every dollar that men earn
working in agriculture. If we simply close these gaps, global GDP would
rise by nearly $1 trillion, and 45 million fewer people would go
hungry. As part of our new Generating Resilience and Opportunities for
Women initiative, one-third of every dollar we spend through Feed the
Future will go toward women's economic empowerment, essential targeted
programming to yield the results I have been talking about.
We are doubling down on Feed the Future's core mandate, to
concentrate bilateral investments in several countries that we know are
most in need and are best poised for regional agricultural-led economic
growth. Already, we've identified a subset of Feed the Future target
countries in Southern Africa that, with adequate investment, we feel
could give rise to a new regional breadbasket for the continent.
We welcome of course additional investment and attention to global
food security, and are eager to partner with this Committee, and
others, on how to best work toward those goals. For example, we welcome
the opportunity to engage on the Global Food Security Foundation
legislation introduced by Senators Coons, Graham, and Boozman. As
Congress thinks through such ideas, USAID can be a valuable partner.
While we are heartened by the progress we've made and optimistic
about what our reforms will yield impact, we should again be clear-eyed
about the circumstances the world faces. The current El Nino weather
pattern has involved weather disruptions that spike food needs around
the world--just last week, Zambia declared a national emergency
following a month without rainfall. As the war in Sudan spills into the
country's breadbasket just as the lean season begins, the threat of
catastrophic famine is very real.
And in Gaza, the entire population, some 2.2 million people, is
facing crisis levels of acute hunger. Administrator Power just returned
from the region, where she joined President Biden, Secretary Blinken,
and other Administration officials in continuing to call for expanding
humanitarian access and, with international partners, scaling up the
amount of life-saving aid we're getting into Gaza. That includes
operating existing border crossings at Kerem Shalom and Rafah at full
capacity, streamlining customs delays and easing restrictions on needed
humanitarian goods, opening up additional land routes into Gaza,
especially in the north, pursuing potential maritime routes, and
conducting air drops. The use of air drops, typically a last resort, is
a clear indication of how dire the humanitarian situation has become.
Humanitarian air drops do not replace the necessity of overland aid
delivery. We also need much stronger protections for humanitarian
workers who are delivering life-saving aid, and ultimately, we urgently
need an immediate and sustained ceasefire during which assistance can
flow and Israeli hostages can be reunited with their families.
There's no question that the state of global food security is
disheartening after so many years of progress. But, the truth is,
without American leadership and continued bipartisan congressional
support, it would be far worse. Through the COVID pandemic, through yet
another food price crisis, through Putin's attempts to shut down a
global breadbasket in Ukraine, we persevered, and hundreds of millions
of people benefited. Children starved to skin and bone were revived;
parents could feed their children without selling off all they owned;
farmers from Kyiv to Kinshasa could sow their fields instead of letting
them lie fallow.
After a career spent battling global hunger, I believe with your
continued support, we can help to usher in a new era of resilience,
agricultural transformation, trade, and global food security, and note
that we are stronger economically when our developing country partners
are stronger as well.
The Chairman. Thank you very much for that testimony.
Dr. Fowler.
STATEMENT OF DR. CARY FOWLER, SPECIAL ENVOY FOR GLOBAL FOOD
SECURITY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON, DC
Dr. Fowler. Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Risch,
distinguished members of the committee, notwithstanding a
dramatic decrease in media attention we still face a global
food crisis.
Conflict, extreme weather, supply chain disruptions are
major factors, and there are others. Food systems are complex.
Everything from farm to fork has to operate as it should. Thus,
there are many components to address if food insecurity is to
become food and nutrition security.
At the food production stage there are conditions that
every farmer wants and needs: Good, fertile soils and
appropriate fertilizers; seed varieties that are adapted to the
environment, the climate, and the market; water; and
functioning markets and access to those markets.
Trade is critical. The majority of countries in this world
are net food importers. We live in a highly interdependent
world.
What happens in one small country, one small corner of the
world--a conflict, a drought, a crop pest, a poorly thought out
policy--rarely stays there.
Early in my career the failure of the anchovy crop off the
western coast of South America was, believe it or not, one of
the major triggers of a global food crisis. Everything seems to
be connected.
Historically the most successful way of increasing food
production was to increase cropland. But in the 1980s for the
first time global per capita food supply increased without an
increase in cropland. We thus entered into a new era where
producing more with less sustainably became the imperative.
There are many challenges to overcome. We have a clear and
pressing humanitarian reason for wanting to try. We also have
self-interest--we all want to live in a peaceful world.
The problems associated with global food insecurity are
beyond what any individual country can solve or be expected to
solve, but the way we choose to engage makes a difference.
The United States is in a unique position to lead. This is
an area of comparative advantage for us. It is where our
strength lies. We can lead with programs such as the Feed the
Future program and others that you will hear about today.
We can lead with technology, with research, and good old
fashioned know how. We can lead with analysis and strategy. We
can lead with diplomacy.
Most of all, perhaps, we can lead with ideas, with our
American values, and with our commitment. Thank you.

Prepared Statement of Dr. Cary Fowler
Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Risch, and distinguished members of
the Committee, thank you for inviting me today to testify on the U.S.
response to the global food security crisis. I appreciate the
opportunity to discuss this critical issue.
When the world entered the protracted ongoing food crisis, the
United States--with Congress' support--led the international response.
Since the start of the Biden Administration, the United States has
provided more than $22.3 billion in acute and development food
assistance, of which nearly $14.2 billion of emergency assistance in
2023/2024, and with nearly $2 billion over the next fiscal year
targeted at medium to longer-term agricultural development in addition
to the most vulnerable. We provide over one third of the total budget
to the World Food Programme.
As the Deputy Coordinator for Diplomacy for the global Feed the
Future initiative, I lead the diplomatic agenda for our global food
security development efforts. In 2023, the State Department launched
the Vision for Adapted Crops and Soils (VACS) with the African Union
and the Food and Agriculture Organization. As a part of the Feed the
Future initiative and the President's Emergency Plan for Adaptation and
Resilience (PREPARE), VACS is our comprehensive response to build
sustainable food security around the world, and the approach that we
have is two-pronged. We're investing above ground, identifying the
indigenous crops that are most nutritious and most resilient to climate
change, improving these varieties; at the same time, we're investing
below ground, mapping, conserving, building healthy soils. If you get
the seeds right, if you get the soil right, then you have your
agricultural foundation for the future.
But for as much as we have done to bring relief to those facing the
most acute need, there remains more to do. Hunger and poverty around
the world are destabilizing conditions that can influence conflict.
Conflict is the number one driver of food insecurity. Food insecurity
impacts conditions local for our partner countries, regional security,
and U.S. national security. Modern conflicts are not confined by
political borders, and food insecurity must be addressed not only
because it's in our national interest, but addressing global hunger and
malnutrition is in the fabric of who we are as Americans. It's part of
our DNA.
More than 700 million people are hungry. Child stunting and wasting
is far too widespread. Global food demand will increase by more than 50
percent by 2050 as the population approaches 10 billion, while
environmental stressors and climate change could reduce yields by as
much as 30 percent.
While the impact of COVID on the global food system has largely
abated, other challenges continue. The costs of basic inputs for
farmers to improve soil conditions and have access to basic seeds and
materials continues to be out of reach. Currency devaluation across
markets in developing countries have priced basic inputs for
agricultural production to be out of reach for small to medium scale
farmers. Additionally, Russia, through its attacks on Ukrainian port
facilities, continues to raise the cost of doing business for companies
to acquire Ukraine's grain exports and destroys its grain silos. We are
also in the middle of a strong El Nino weather pattern, with dramatic
increases in temperatures and changes to the timing and amount of
rainfall, leading to water variability and scarcity or drought. Farmers
across the United States, Europe, South America, and Asia are enduring
some of the hottest heatwaves on record.
Such shocks will keep coming and we must be ready. Each of these
challenges is proof that we need to couple our emergency assistance to
help those affected in the moment with bold efforts to build systemic
resilience and strengthen productivity. Resilience and strength are not
built overnight; our challenges are enduring, and our solutions must be
too.
At the recent World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland, Secretary
Blinken highlighted that the United States is partnering to help adapt
and transform agriculture and food systems, because as vital as
emergency assistance is, if we don't get at the underlying
infrastructure, if we don't get at a way to produce better, stronger,
more resilient crops, then we won't help solve the problem.
We need to continue investing in fundamental and transformational
change--beyond our much-needed humanitarian assistance, and all inputs
along the agricultural value chain, in order to scale agricultural
research efforts. Presently, we are addressing the very foundation of
agriculture: Crops and soils. Food security depends fundamentally on
seeds and soils--specifically crop varieties adapted to withstand
extreme weather and soils that are fertile, resilient to drought, and
resistant to erosion.
The State Department has committed $150 million thus far toward
VACS. We've also partnered with a broad coalition of governments around
the world to advance this work including Japan, Norway, the United
Kingdom, the Netherlands, as well as leading nonprofits and
corporations. We have successfully integrated VACS goals into the on-
going discussions held at the G7 as well as advanced the larger Feed
the Future agenda. We are also partnering through implementors to
expand access to artificial intelligence technologies and climate
modeling to deliver tailored farming and field management
recommendations, given soil quality and seeds, directly to small holder
farmers worldwide.
We have seen that the world is getting hotter, which have had
varying impacts across the agricultural value chain. Extreme weather
has reduced agricultural yields in some parts of the world, and a
crippling lack of hard currency coupled with high prices of basic
agricultural inputs continue to accelerate the growing numbers of
globally food insecure populations. Global food insecurity continues to
be a growing national security threat to the United States. There is
increasing global understanding of this link, as we saw clearly at the
most recent Munich Security Conference. We should capitalize on this
momentum and political will to secure our economic and national
security interests. We must continue to invest and expand our
investment in long term sustainable agricultural production of diverse,
indigenous, climate resilient food through Feed the Future programs
including VACS. Failure to do so, will result in an ever-increasing
annual cycle of severe humanitarian needs, acute hunger and
malnutrition, and increasing civil unrest.
We must focus more on preparing and preventing--not just
responding, and on root causes rather than symptoms. This will require
continued bi-partisan commitment to aim high and the endurance to
invest in long-term solutions. I welcome being a reliable partner and
collaborating with this Committee and the Congress to advance and
support these goals.
The Chairman. Thank you very much for that testimony.
I am going to start the round of questioning with the
point, Dr. Fowler, that you concluded, and that is conducting
on our values.
Autocratic governments have an asymmetric arsenal to attack
our democratic systems of government. We saw in Russia's case
the use of oil and gas as a weapon of war to try to intimidate
other countries.
We now see that in regards to grain. They have disrupted
Ukraine's grain exports. We have made some progress in that
regard thanks to the international efforts and the courage of
the Ukrainians, but the grain supply from Ukraine has been very
much disadvantaged.
Russia, on the other hand, has increased their exports over
the last 3 years by about 30 percent in its grain, offering it
particularly in Africa at low cost, or in some cases, free.
So I just really want to get your view as to how what
Russia is doing in Ukraine and the use of its grain diplomacy,
how that is affecting the stability of the world's food
supplies, and again, making Russia more aggressive in their use
of this weapon.
Dr. Fowler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Obviously, Ukraine was one of the top five exporters of a
number of important commodities. Russia is also a top exporter.
And you are correct that Russia has seized some of the market
that they in fact have destroyed for Ukraine.
The exports in Ukraine are up year over year, but I think
it is always a little bit problematic to compare one year to
the previous year because of the kinds of differences that
occur in production year over year.
What we can see is that production in the land area in
Ukraine devoted to agriculture is down from pre-war and pre-
COVID levels. I think when I have taken a look at what Russia
has done in Ukraine it, of course, has been really hard to
fathom the kind of destruction that has been wreaked on that
country and the impact that that has had globally.
Yes, markets adjust price wise, but what we cannot adjust
to is the decrease in the production coming from that war in
Ukraine.
It is a crime against and a war on food security. I will
just note that in all of my many years of working in this area
I have been privileged to see a number of projects and
initiatives that the United States has undertaken in developing
countries in recent years through the Feed the Future program,
for example.
I have never in all of my years actually seen a Russian
agricultural development project in a developing country.
Perhaps they exist. I have not seen them.
The Chairman. Ms. Esposito, I want to call out how other
countries in the world are responding to this crisis. U.S. is
the largest donor nation. I know other nations are doing
incredibly important work in regards to this crisis. Other
countries are not.
Can you just give us a report of where we can be more
effective in putting a spotlight on those countries that should
be doing more in regards to this crisis?
Ms. Esposito. Thanks, Senator Cardin, for that question.
You are right that we see the United States continuing to
lead on the humanitarian response covering, roughly, 45 percent
of the U.N. World Food Programme's budget.
We continue to call for more support from around the world
to support the U.N. World Food Programme. On the development
side of the house I think we are seeing some glimmers of new
partnerships that are trying to address some of the underlying
causes of the food crisis.
Secretary Vilsack and USDA are leading a global call to
action to invest urgently in more climate resilient crop
research, and they have generated over 500 partner commitments
from other governments and from the private sector, some $17
billion of commitment.
So we want to continue to use those kinds of platforms to
drive more support likely in--also in AGRI-Ukraine and in
Ukraine we continue at AID to call on partners to join us in
supporting the farmers of Ukraine to get seeds, fertilizer, and
finance.
And so we can use all forums and our voice and your voice
to call on other countries to support these kinds of efforts on
the development side as well as the humanitarian side in the
hope that we can mitigate some of the overall impact of the
crisis.
The Chairman. That was a very diplomatic answer but not
really responsive to my question.
What I am going to ask that you supply to us are the
numbers so that we can see what countries are doing. We will
make our own judgments based upon that.
But there are certainly countries that should be doing a
lot more, and we believe in putting spotlights on those
countries.
It is one thing for us to ask our taxpayers to do more, and
we do and to get more resources. But it is also important that
the global community respond to the food crisis that we have,
and we need to have from you the objective information so we
know where to put our attention.
Senator Risch.
Senator Risch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Ms. Esposito, let me ask of you first we have got countries
that are facing hunger and food insecurity at a very, very high
level but also are accompanied in those same countries with
endemic corruption perpetrated at really the highest levels,
and a couple of poster children for that are Zimbabwe and South
Sudan.
I wonder if you could talk for a few minutes about how
USAID ensures that our efforts to improve egg and food security
are accomplished without contributing to the corruption.
I mean, look, we are all trying to do the right thing here.
But I will tell you, it is tough when you run into these kinds
of examples. So can you talk a little bit about that and as
specifically as you can?
Ms. Esposito. Thank you for the question.
The Feed the Future portfolio has really tried to
prioritize countries that we think have the commitment to
invest in their own agriculture as well as the opportunity to
drive economic growth. So places like Tanzania, which has
tripled its investments for agriculture in the last year, and
other countries--Zambia, Malawi, Kenya, which are investing in
their own future.
In all cases, whether it be the places like Sudan or
Zimbabwe or these other countries, we are relying on
international partners. We are not giving money directly to
governments, and we are creating, as you know, its very
rigorous risk mitigation efforts and safeguards that we are
working with our partners to help ensure that the money is used
exactly for its intended purposes.
I would also say that one of the priorities of Feed the
Future is to work on policy reform and regulatory reform. Often
some of the challenges that we see when Special Envoy Fowler
and I were going around southern Africa is that we really do
have an opportunity to influence governments through our policy
agenda to catalyze private sector investment, to accept
improved seeds, to open regional trade, and so we are trying to
use our influence in a way that would actually improve the
overall context without contributing to further corruption.
Senator Risch. Well, I appreciate that and certainly those
efforts are laudable and need to be doubled down because there
is nothing more frustrating than trying to do the right thing
and then seeing things wind up in the wrong hands.
Dr. Fowler, I want to talk with you for a few minutes about
another thing that is very frustrating, and that is the U.S.
cargo preference requirements.
I think--we really believe that these make food aid
delivery through the Food for Peace and Emerson Trust programs
too slow and too expensive. Do you agree or disagree with that?
Dr. Fowler. I have to apologize--I am sorry.
Senator Risch. I understand it is a political issue, and so
I will give you the leeway you need there to answer the
question.
Dr. Fowler. Yes. Senator, that is an issue that probably is
handled a little bit more in detail by my colleagues from AID.
I am afraid I have not gotten into that.
Senator Risch. Ms. Esposito, do you have anything to
contribute to that?
Ms. Esposito. Thank you, Senator Risch.
I am familiar with the cargo preference requirements from
my time working in the Office of Food for Peace. I can say that
at present the USAID is able to comply with cargo preference
requirements while meeting its humanitarian mandate.
But you do know that increased costs for ocean transport on
U.S. flagged vessels does come at the expense of reaching more
people. Today we estimate it is about twice as much to move
bulk cargo on U.S. flagged ships than other ships, and they do
not always go to the locations that we require.
Senator Risch. When President Biden ordered an
extraordinary draw down of the Emerson Trust in April of 2022
it took 12 months and $388 million to transport $282 million
worth of food. Then, unfortunately, this is not the exception.
It is the rule. This is really frustrating, when you are
talking about spending more money than what you are actually
delivering to get it there. What can we do about this?
Ms. Esposito. I think that right now we know that there are
individuals looking to change the cargo preference one way or
another, and we really do want to both support our American
farmers where it is appropriate and also meet our humanitarian
mandate.
So as the law is currently written we are finding that we
can do both of those things but recognizing we could certainly
do more if there were further flexibility in this regard.
Senator Risch. My time is up.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The Chairman. Senator Coons.
Senator Coons. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member,
and thank you both for your focus on this at the full committee
level and for your partnership, and I could not agree more with
the ranking member that we have worked, many of us for many
years, on cargo preference to improve efficiency.
Senator Corker and I tried and tried over many years,
Senator Johanns previously. So I do think real progress has
been made in delivering food assistance directly. The
availability of cell phones and individually identifying
information makes transparent and efficient transfer of
resources to hungry refugees around the world far more easy and
far more efficient than it has ever been before.
The folks who are protesting here and who have been outside
my house every weekend are focusing, understandably, on the
severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza. But I want us to take one
moment and focus on the numbers that Ms. Esposito put in front
of us in her opening statement.
Seven hundred and thirty-five million people across the
world chronically hungry, 140 million acutely hungry, double
the number in 2019.
There is, roughly, 2 million people in Gaza, and we need to
do more to deliver timely humanitarian aid. I was just in the
region in Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and elsewhere meeting with
the U.N. related relief organizations and talking with leaders
in Israel about how we do a better job of that. But that is for
2 million people. Around the world there is 140 million people
chronically hungry.
And so while we do remain focused on the challenges in
Ukraine and Gaza because of conflict, we also have to be
mindful of other conflicts around the world like Sudan, like
Armenia, like Somalia, like Yemen, which continue to put
literally whole nations at risk because of food insecurity.
And I urge members of the House to take up and pass the
President's supplemental that includes $9 billion for
humanitarian aid. But to the point both the chair and ranking
made at the outset and to the core point, Dr. Fowler, of your
whole work, your vision for adapted crops and soils, we have to
make investments in being more efficient, in improving food
systems, in having seeds and soils and systems that meet this
moment.
So even at this moment, this late date, I am fighting in
the Appropriations Committee to ensure that $50 million you
referenced, Ms. Esposito, and more efforts at deploying the
private sector come into play.
So I have two questions I wanted to make sure we got to.
First, Africa has the ability to feed itself if we get food
systems aligned. A country like Angola, where I am going soon,
imports 80 percent of its food. A country like Zambia, which is
going through a drought, could be the breadbasket of the whole
region.
The global food security strategy has had a huge impact on
small holders and SMEs, but we need to do more to mobilize the
private sector, which is the engine of opportunity for post
Farmgate for everything that is grown and produced on a farm
then leaves and has to be processed and stored and distributed.
Do you agree we need to do more to support emerging
investment opportunities as you referenced, Ms. Esposito, for
larger scale agribusiness that can complement smallholder farms
and to rationalize and modernize the farm systems of the
developing world?
Ms. Esposito. Thank you for the question, Senator.
Increasing public-private partnerships is actually at the
forefront of the new global food security strategy.
It has always been important to us. We generated $700
million and leveraged private sector money in 2022 and we are
aiming for closer to $900 million in the coming years.
Some of the examples of that work Cary--Special Envoy
Fowler and I saw in Zambia where an American company, Pyxus
Agriculture, was working with an innovation lab--an American
innovation lab--to develop improved seeds, both soybean
varieties that were quadrupling yields for some farmers as well
as peanut varieties.
In turn, we have invested in helping to derisk their
investment, and they, in turn, are using over 150,000 farmers
to contract farm. So there you have a really nice linkage
between smallholder farmers and the goals and ambitions of
commercial agriculture. The same is true----
Senator Coons. I am about to go to Zambia, and I look
forward to----
Ms. Esposito. Great.
Senator Coons . Talking with you in more detail
about that, if I could, with the forbearance of the chairman.
Senator Graham and I have introduced legislation to create
an international foundation for food security. The whole point
of it is to provide blended financing tools that would catalyze
investment--not to compete with Feed the Future but to
complement it.
Do you think that blending financing tools--credit, risk
insurance, first loss guarantees--could help scale your
efforts, and Dr. Fowler, complement your efforts with
smallholder farmers to leverage larger agribusiness
investments?
Ms. Esposito. Thank you for the question.
We are really grateful to you, Senator Coons, and Senator
Graham in the fight against hunger, your vocal protestations on
the state of the world and your leadership and constantly
looking for new ways of doing business. We are really fortunate
to have your passion and engagement on this.
We have provided some general comments, and we in general
are very supportive of the vision behind the global food
security foundation bill. We really would like to sit down--we
have not had a chance to sit down with all of you and go
through the details so that we can really work on ensuring that
things are mutually reinforcing and complementary.
But certainly, this idea that we can do more to crowd in
private sector is absolutely on point, and we think there is a
way to connect these two efforts for leverage.
Senator Coons. That would be helpful. We are looking for a
vehicle that will survive across several Administrations and
put in place long term blended finance opportunities.
Mr. Chairman, would you allow Dr. Fowler to briefly answer?
Doctor.
Dr. Fowler. Thank you. I will be brief.
The programmatic elements that you mentioned are, indeed,
some of the missing pieces that we often see in Africa and
other continents for scaling up the kinds of technologies we
have and for getting the private sector involved. So those are
important things to highlight. Thank you for doing so.
Senator Coons. I look forward to a chance to meet with both
of you to hammer out some of the details to make sure we can
move forward in a timely way.
Thank you for your forbearance, Mr. Chairman, and thank you
to both of our witnesses for your very long, engaged,
determined, and effective advocacy on behalf of the world's
hungry. It is great to see both of you.
Thank you.
The Chairman. Senator Shaheen.

Senator Shaheen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I think this is probably, first, for Dr. Fowler because in
your closing comments you talked about the way we choose to
engage makes a difference to the world and that we can lead
with diplomacy.
But one of the areas where the United States is not
positioned to help is where we do not have Ambassadors on the
ground who can advocate, and as Senator Coons just pointed out
so eloquently, there are more than 140 million people on the
African continent facing acute food insecurity.
Without addressing that we will see the number of displaced
people across the African continent increased. It is already 40
million. But we do not have an ambassador to the African Union.
We do not have Ambassadors in eight other countries on the
continent where food insecurity--many of them where food
insecurity is a real issue.
And by the way, in those countries our adversary, our
biggest competitor, the People's Republic of China, do have
Ambassadors, who have been on the ground operating.
So can you talk about how the absence of our Ambassadors
hinders our ability to respond to the needs of our partners
with respect to food security?
Dr. Fowler. Thank you, Senator.
You are, indeed, correct. We have gotten a tremendous
amount of support from our missions in Africa.
They are hampered when the leadership at the top--when an
ambassador is not present, and you are correct in saying that
China is quite active in Africa. We have seen that.
One of the issues that really troubles me the most is that
we--in Africa 80 percent of the people in sub-Sahara Africa
cannot afford a nutritious diet.
There are a number of causes behind that, but this is an
area where we need leadership both from here in Washington but
also on the ground through the missions to make the kind of
programs that my colleague, Ms. Esposito, has mentioned
actually function properly.
And I would also take the opportunity to mention that in
the last 50 years our public sector agricultural R&D budget
inflation adjusted is about the same as it was 50 years ago
today.
In the interim China has far outpaced us in its public
sector R&D funding. I think it went from less than 1 percent in
1980 to now 23 or 24 percent. We are less than 20.
This has historically been our comparative advantage, and
so much of the agricultural research and development that we
have done, both aimed toward developing countries but also
internally in the United States, has inured to the benefit of
Africa and other developing countries. We need to keep up that
comparative advantage as well.
Senator Shaheen. I would certainly agree with that, and I
failed to point out as I was talking about the lack of
Ambassadors in Africa that, sadly, what is holding up those
Ambassadors are our colleagues on the other side of the aisle.
Ms. Esposito, despite women playing a crucial role in
feeding their families in the world they often eat last, and
they eat least. In fact, last year 84.2 million more women and
girls were hungry than men and boys worldwide.
So can you talk about how USAID structures the food
security programs to try and address that disparity between men
and women, and what we are doing to help ensure that women are
engaged in all aspects of food insecurity?
Ms. Esposito. Thank you, Senator. You are right in your
concern. There was a very disturbing report by FAO last spring
on women and agrifood systems which said that despite our
efforts they still produce 24 percent less food on their lands,
they still have less access to finance, less access to
information and other tools. And one of the things we have done
is to increase our commitment significantly within Feed the
Future, and we have made a public commitment at the launch of
that to reach no less than $350 million of our portfolio each
year focusing on closing that gap.
We have set top line targets to reach parity on finance for
men and women in our programs and also to improve women's
dietary diversity. Our job is to increase the food supply and
get safe, healthy, affordable food on the market.
Our global health colleagues are very focused on exclusive
breastfeeding and supplements, and our humanitarian colleagues
are focused on the treatment and prevention--the prevention of
moderate and acute malnutrition.
It takes all of those things together, not just the Feed
the Future program to get--this is really an intractable issue
on both unleashing the potential for women and improving
nutrition.
Senator Shaheen. Well, thank you for that, and thank you
both for the work that you are doing.
Did you want to respond, Dr. Fowler?
Dr. Fowler. Thank you. I would love to respond.
One of the things that really breaks my heart on this
subject is the degree of childhood stunting. Stunting is where
the height is inappropriate for the age and there are 150
million children under the age of 5 who are stunted.
That is a physical stunting. It is a mental stunting. It
lasts for the rest of the life. It is impossible for me to
imagine how countries with very high stunting rates--20, 30
percent of the children under 5--are going to develop
economically and otherwise with that kind of situation.
One, that has driven our program called VACS, the Vision
for Adapted Crops and Soils, where we are focusing on
traditional and indigenous crops in Africa. We have identified
the ones that have the most potential for nutrition.
Most of those crops have historically been tended by women,
and they are nutrition dense. So if we want to get at the
problems that you raised and if we want to address really
directly the problem of childhood stunting we empower women by
empowering and increasing the productivity of the crops that
they grow to address those macro and micronutrient problems.
Senator Shaheen. Thank you.
Thank you both very much for your work.
The Chairman. Senator Booker.
Senator Booker. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, I want to
thank you for having what I think is an urgently important
committee hearing, and I want to thank our witnesses who have
such extraordinary careers of serving this country, and
frankly, making a difference in the lives of millions of human
beings across the planet, and I am just deeply grateful.
I want to reiterate your question, Mr. Cardin, that you did
not quite get an answer to--maybe we can write--just about how
opportunistic it is for us or there are opportunities that are
presented to us to engage with leaders from other countries
from the Middle East to Europe to be able to know which
countries to really target in our conversation about raising
their burden.
We had extraordinary meetings--Senator Coons was there with
Ambassadors from the European Union--and really a frank
conversation about the resources that they can do, and a shift
of millions of dollars one way or the other. We know it makes a
difference on the ground. So any--in writing any kind of help
you can give us with that.
I want to reiterate what Senator Shaheen said, perhaps, not
for you all but having just come back from West Africa--East
Africa, excuse me--and seeing the difference that leadership
makes not having Ambassadors in Djibouti, not having
Ambassadors in Somalia. I mean, it is powerful how much an
ambassador makes a difference in the details of negotiating
with countries who find it a sign of disrespect when we have
these positions vacant, and for us not to have a leader in the
African Union is absolutely absurd at this point.
And then, finally, for some of my questions, I just want to
get back to where Senator Coons was leading with his questions
because I think it is so important.
The U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization is--to me, I
have learned over the last years how critical it is. It works
with the World Food Programme but FAO typically focuses on
longer term activities, detailed by my friend Senator Coons.
It provides technical expertise on agricultural
sustainability, market access, and really the returns on that
in the long run are profoundly staggering to me when it comes
to longer term solutions of problems that we can empower
countries to deal with.
Every dollar spent to protect rural livelihoods can save
around $10 in food related assistance for displaced families,
and by doing that you are not only supporting agricultural
resiliency and strength in the future, you are undermining what
often becomes economic conditions that lead to instability and
to extremism.
So I do not even think that $1 invested to $10 return is
anywhere near the truth of what it does, and despite the
evidence that investing in long term food resiliency programs
pays these incredible dividends, saves U.S. taxpayers money, we
do not prioritize it in the way that I think, given the
results.
So this is just an example. In fiscal year 2023 the United
States contributed about $5.9 billion to the World Food
Programme thanks to the efforts of my colleagues, the
leadership of this committee. But in the same fiscal year we
only contributed $110 million to the Food and Agricultural
Organization.
And so that, to me, is very stunning, and I was wondering,
Dr. Fowler, how do you view this policy imbalance toward long
term food insecurity?
Dr. Fowler. Thank you, Senator. This is a difficult
question that perhaps philosophers should engage in as well as
people like us.
I think we have to realize that food aid is not the same
thing as food security, and one of the difficult realities that
we have to face is that the gap between what we can and are
willing to supply in terms of humanitarian assistance and what
is needed on the ground is growing, and one need only look at
the WFP budget for this year versus previous years and the need
that they are trying to address to understand that.
You are certainly correct that an ounce of prevention is
worth a lot of cure and part of the thing that I think we need
to be mindful of is that the type of long term investments that
are necessary for driving productivity not just in the United
States but abroad are investments that we really need to make.
There was a report that was done for BIFAD, the Board for
International Food and Agricultural Development, for USAID just
a few years ago that pointed out that the agricultural R&D
budget of ours that is focused on foreign agricultural research
and development actually pays net benefits to U.S. farmers. And
sometimes the cost-benefit ratio of this--or overall the cost-
benefit ratio of R&D domestic and foreign is tremendous--10 to
1, 30 to 1.
So these are the types of investments that pay off both
abroad, lower the incidence of the tensions, and contribute to
having peace and stability. But they are also the kinds of
investments that pay off for U.S. farmers.
Senator Booker. This is a conversation I want to have more.
My time has expired. There are folks waiting.
But I just want to say for the--a question for the record.
Ms. Esposito, last November myself and multiple Senators on
this committee wrote a letter to Administrator Power where we
asked for common sense efficiency reforms to reach more kids
with acute malnutrition. I am hoping that I can get your
commitment to work with the staff to get actually an update on
where we stand.
I want to just say as forcefully as I can the supplemental
that is coming up, it is staggering to me that there are people
suggesting in the House of Representatives to strip out the $9
billion+ in humanitarian aid.
From Afghanistan to Lebanon to Jordan, having just returned
from Jordan now, if we do not put humanitarian aid there, these
nations that are critical for stability in the Middle East
region could plunge into instability, causing us a greater need
for military intervention and more.
I also want to emphasize, having just come back from the
continent and going again in 2 weeks, that if we do not get
resources into countries--humanitarian resources--in the midst
of this great power competition with China, we are so
undermining our future interest on the continent, and given
that we, from Sudan to the Horn to the DRC, we--the urgency of
those resources as investments now to save us necessary
military investments or losing ground to the Chinese, it is
just unconscionable.
So I just want to make that point that the food and
humanitarian assistance resources are utterly critical, going
forward.
And I thank you for your indulgence, Mr. Chairman.
The Chairman. Senator Booker, I agree with your point.
The numbers that we have gotten so far with other
countries--as you point out the United States is the largest
contributor to the World Food Programme, giving multi-billions
of dollars every year--PRC is at $13.7 million. Million.
We are in the billions. Russia at $71 million. Madagascar
and Burundi give more money than the PRC to the World Food
Programme.
So there is a real attention here that we need to know. We
will get the specific numbers from all countries. The Europeans
are doing better, but they could do more. So I thank you for
raising those issues.
We are up to Senator Ricketts.
Senator Ricketts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Ranking Member Risch, and thank you for our
witnesses here to testify and taking your time today.
Water and food security are two of the most pressing issues
facing the world today. With a growing population, growing
demand for resources, and increasing disruptions to water and
food systems it is vital to find sustainable and practical ways
to overcome these challenges.
The University of Nebraska's Daugherty Water for Food
Global Institute is uniquely positioned to advance water
management for greater food security.
By leveraging the world class research at the University of
Nebraska, the State's expertise in agriculture and water
resource management, and private sector partnerships, the
institute is making progress on a more water and food secure
future.
In October 2023 the institute received a $19 million grant
from USAID to lead a global collaboration aimed at developing
irrigation mechanization for small farmers in developing
countries.
This partnership focuses on technical aspects of irrigation
and issues crucial to long term successes such as work force
development, installation, maintenance, and more.
Ms. Esposito, how can USAID continue to address the global
challenges of water availability and drought resilience through
investments in partnerships with innovative organizations like
the Daugherty Water for Food Global Institute at the University
of Nebraska?
Ms. Esposito. Thank you, Senator, for the question, and I
am just delighted that Nebraska is now part of the innovation
labs. We are very much looking forward to them joining the 16
innovation labs around the world.
The focus on irrigation mechanization is absolutely vital
as we try to boost agricultural production in a changing
climate. And we know in fact that in extremely low income
countries women and youth in particular and other marginalized
groups, many of them who are on the forefront of producing more
food, are not getting the benefits of that small scale
irrigation and mechanization.
So we really are looking forward to the research and the
advice of the university in terms of how we can scale that to
many, many more women and young people who are going to be the
future of agriculture.
Senator Ricketts. So and as you are aware, farmers in
developing nations oftentimes have difficulty adopting
irrigation technology. That is due to a number of factors
including a lack of technological expertise, quality work
force, cultural barriers.
How is USAID working to create a buy in with local
communities and producers to ensure irrigation infrastructure
is not only utilized but maintained throughout its lifecycle?
Ms. Esposito. You are right, Senator. It is one thing to
introduce a new technology; it is another thing to scale and
maintain it. I would have to get back to you on the details on
how AID is working on that.
Senator Ricketts. Well, Nebraska is the home to some of the
world's largest irrigation companies which deliver innovative
solutions for food production around the world. So, perhaps,
some of those companies can do it.
It is critical to support the development of irrigation
infrastructure to allow developing countries' food systems to
sustain themselves. About 80 percent of all the world's center
pivot irrigation equipment is actually manufactured in
Nebraska.
Has USAID got something similar to the Water and Energy for
Food program that allows U.S. irrigation companies to engage in
the innovation ecosystem with USDA programs?
Ms. Esposito. We have a very strong team of people working
on public-private partnerships, and we would be delighted to
meet with or speak with those irrigation companies and see how
we can sync up their innovations with our global footprint.
Senator Ricketts. Yes, that would be great. Again, there is
a lot of innovation going on in the State of Nebraska. We are
the largest irrigated State in the country.
We actually have more irrigated acres than even California,
and even while doing--having large irrigation because of our
system of water management, which also goes into the regulatory
side--actually, I think USAID should be paying attention to as
well--we have managed to keep the Ogallala Aquifer within one
foot of where it was in the 1950s.
So even while we are irrigating more we are also finding
ways to innovate to be able to produce more food with less
water and keep the groundwater at a stable level.
So I think there would be a lot of benefit if you all
looked at working with our irrigation companies on some of
these technologies and to see how it might be adapted to
different countries that are not going to be able to have the
big center pivots, but other sorts of irrigation technologies
that would be able to be taken advantage of in those developing
nations.
Ms. Esposito. We welcome that offer, and we look forward to
speaking with you more.
Senator Ricketts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The Chairman. Senator Van Hollen.
Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank both
of you for your service and for your testimony.
As this hearing has highlighted we have desperate hunger
around the world. Over 300 million people are facing acute
levels of food insecurity this year. The conditions are
particularly dire in Sudan, South Sudan, Burkina Faso, and Mali
also. Situation only slightly better in Syria, Afghanistan,
Yemen, Somalia, and other countries.
But today I do want to focus on the situation in Gaza,
because according to all reports four out of five of the
hungriest people in the world today live in Gaza and this is,
clearly, a manmade crisis.
There was no real food insecurity in Gaza until the last 4
months. We also have recently passed the grim threshold where
people are not just on the verge of starvation but over 15 kids
have now died of starvation in Gaza.
The U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator put out an update on
February 21st of this year finding that the decline in the
population's nutrition status is happening at a globally
unprecedented rate and that children in Gaza are being starved
at the fastest rate that the world has ever seen, according to
the U.N. humanitarian coordinator.
I am very pleased to see both the President and the Vice
President and the AID administrator more recently make forceful
comments about the need for the Netanyahu government to allow
more aid into Gaza.
Twenty-five Senators wrote to the President in early
February laying out five specific steps that could be taken to
do that. None of those steps have been implemented as of now.
So, Ms. Esposito, if you could just make one thing really
clear. The issue is not the lack of the U.S. or the World Food
Programme making food available to go into Gaza. Is that right?
It is not a question of not enough being made available
that is ready to go in. It is a question of it getting in and
getting to people in need.
Ms. Esposito. Thank you, Senator.
I want to start by saying up front that my remit is on the
development side, and all of the programs we had in Gaza have
been suspended, of course, because of the conflict.
But I do know that we do have great concern about the
imminence of a famine and that our team is really working on
getting more food in, especially for women and children and
that there is opportunity and available food to move in.
I would also say, though, I think it is important to recall
that the humanitarian food budgets because of the supplemental
were up at $12 billion in 2022. They went down 35 percent in
2023. This year without a supplemental it will be 50 percent of
what we had in 2022, and while there is food to be moved,
medicine and supplies to be moved, when that ceasefire comes
into place and we can really flood the zone with food it is
going to be really, really important to get additional
resources.
Right now our bureau for humanitarian assistance is
estimating that in some of the most difficult places in the
world, from Ukraine to Sudan to South Sudan, 40 to 60 percent
reduction in the amount of humanitarian and food assistance the
U.S. Government can provide in the absence of additional
resources.
Senator Van Hollen. Well, I second the comments that
Senator Coons made and I am sure the chairman probably
emphasized and others that we absolutely have to get the
humanitarian assistance from the supplemental to address these
issues worldwide.
Dr. Fowler, you are an expert on food security and
nutrition, and I would like for you just to talk a little bit
about the long term impacts of malnutrition and going without
food for kids.
UNICEF's Ted Chaiban, who is the deputy executive director
for humanitarian action at UNICEF, pointed out, and I quote
that--well, that the international community has, quote, ``been
warning for weeks that the Gaza Strip is on the brink of a
nutrition crisis. If the conflict does not end now, children's
nutrition will continue to plummet, leading to preventable
deaths or health issues which will affect the children of Gaza
for the rest of their lives and have potential
intergenerational consequences.''
Do you agree that that can be a consequence of kids being
deprived of nutrition?
Dr. Fowler. Yes, I do. As you know, the U.N. has estimated
that 90 percent of the population in Gaza continues to face
acute food insecurity, and this has an impact, first and
foremost, on children, and of course, women as well.
We know that early interventions for childhood nutrition
pay benefits for the entire life of the person. On the flip
side of that we know that long periods without sufficient food,
without the necessary calories, micronutrients, macronutrients,
this also can have lifelong consequences. I spoke earlier to
this committee about the problem of stunting.
So we believe that Israel must facilitate the delivery of
assistance through crossings, improve deconfliction procedures
to ensure that that aid can move safely and securely and that
restrictions that prevent the flow of life saving food into
Gaza are not acceptable.
Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. Thank you both.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The Chairman. Senator Young.
Senator Young. I thank our witnesses for being here today.
I would like to explore how artificial intelligence
technologies and their continued advancement intersect with
this topic.
Predicting food insecurity so that we can obtain and pre-
position supplies has been a life saving advancement in the
field of humanitarian aid made during our lifetimes.
The ability to build diverse supply chains for food stocks
not only means on time delivery of critical supplies but also a
widening humanitarian donor and supplier base, which itself
helps to mitigate insecurity.
Artificial intelligence enables humanity to fight food
insecurity at every stage of development--automating R&D to
design more resilient high yield seeds, optimizing and mapping
yields throughout each growing season with autonomous tractors
and drones, and predicting disruptions to enable a resilient
supply chain that meets demand and saves lives.
But AI use as a predictive tool is only as good as the data
it is trained on. An unprecedented disruption of global supply
routes, be it through the Red Sea, Black Sea, or over land, has
direct consequences on food and ag availability.
So to both of our witnesses please give us a state of play,
or in the absence maybe of tangible examples, your assessment
of how AI can and should be deployed to better predict both ag
shortages due to issues like water scarcity, natural disasters,
or quality of cropland, and global supply route disruptions and
the cascading effect of logistical and transportation
disruptions to food supplies for countries who heavily rely on
imports.
Dr. Fowler. I will begin. Senator, thank you for that most
interesting question.
I think I am too old to be an expert on AI, but we have
recently had the occasion to use AI in some of our work with
some interesting results.
In the VACS program--the Vision for Adapted Crops and
Soils--we focused on 60 traditional and indigenous crops in
Africa that had a lot of potential for adding nutrition. There
was not a lot known about those crops.
We used AI and found, I think, an astonishing 180,000
pieces of information that otherwise could not have been found
and that could now be assembled and used to map out where those
crops can be grown, what kind of nutrition they can add.
Similarly, on the soil side I will say that there is a huge
challenge in Africa to map and model the soils of Africa. If
you are going to have a productive and sustainable system of
agriculture you have to know as a government where your good
soils are, where to promote agriculture, where not to, and what
kinds of crops to promote, and as a farmer what kind of
practices to promote as well.
We take that for granted in the United States. We have GPS
linked tractors and combines, for instance. That does not exist
in developing countries.
But using AI and other technologies we can begin to model
what satellite data we do have, model the soils without the
necessity of going to each individual sometimes one and two
acre farm to take soil samples and begin to give the farmers
the kind of information that we take for granted here.
And to your point about the quality of the data going into
such a system through cell phone use, through apps, you can get
now even in Africa recommendations at the farm level of how you
could--best practice agriculture and use the soil information.
But you can also feed back information into the system to
improve it.
Senator Young. Thank you for your thoughtfulness. It was a
long sort of lead in to the question. You unpacked it, I
thought, quite elegantly.
So let me just ask you since my time is somewhat limited,
what, if any, resources from Congress could assist you in
adopting AI technologies or integrating AI supported
predictions into your analysis of what may be the next food
insecurity crisis? What should we do to help you?
Dr. Fowler. Yes.
Senator Young. And if you would like to sort of take that
question under advisement and get back with me that is
acceptable as well because I think you will soon see Members of
Congress attentive to and poised to act as it relates to
artificial intelligence across every area of policymaking. And
the sooner we can incorporate some of the functionality of AI
into decisionmaking and other facets of alleviating food
insecurity, I think probably the better.
Dr. Fowler. Thank you. We would be pleased to have a little
time to think about that and get back to you on the question.
Senator Young. Great. Thank you.
The Chairman. Let me just acknowledge Senator Young's
leadership on the AI issue and really challenging all of us,
particularly every committee, to look within our jurisdiction
as to how we can advance America's leadership on AI
applications.
And I must tell you I never thought about AI in regards to
dealing with world hunger, but clearly there is a major role it
can play, and if there is impediments by law in our
international efforts that is in our committee's jurisdiction,
and we want to make sure when there is an opportunity to move
an AI bill, which the leadership is very committed to doing,
and Senator Young is playing a key role in that, that we
address those issues.
So, Dr. Fowler, if you will get back to us, not only to
Senator Young but our committee, if there is legislative issues
that could be made more friendly toward the application of AI,
and of course, the resource issues are also very much within
our committee's jurisdiction.
So we would appreciate getting back, and Dr. Fowler,
Senator Risch and I took a little bit of umbrage with your use
of the age as affecting AI. I just want you to know that.

The Chairman. Senator Kaine.
Senator Kaine. Thank you.
I am going to ask most of my questions about Haiti but I
did want to ask one question about Gaza.
My memory is not what it used to be. I do not recall during
my time in the Senate the U.S. doing significant air drops of
food. Is this unusual? When was the last time we did air drops
of food like this?
Ms. Esposito. Having spent a good portion of my career on
the humanitarian side----
Senator Kaine. At Mercy Corps.
Ms. Esposito. At Mercy Corps, but also as a member of the
Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, one of the places where
air drops, unfortunately, became sort of a mainstream part of
the agenda was in South Sudan.
Operation Lifeline Sudan during those war years was a
regular, unfortunately, and expensive way to address
communities that were completely cut off--no roads, heavy
rains--and so it became a seasonal activity.
But it is always one of last resort. I do recall one in
Syria as well when I was working on that, the start of the war
there.
Senator Kaine. It is last resort and when there is no
access, no roads, et cetera, I mean, sometimes it is all you
can do. Here is a space where there are roads, there are border
crossings, there are access points, and I am glad we are doing
the food air drops, but I think much more should be done
through traditional means, delivery of food across the border.
About Haiti the situation in Haiti is just very, very grim
and I think there are some things that I hope we might do in
this committee and in the Senate. We have not had a confirmed
Ambassador to Haiti since 2021. Dennis Hankins was nominated in
May 2023 and we still have not acted on that nomination.
Second, we have approved funding for the multinational
security force in Haiti that will be led by the Kenyans, but
those dollars have not yet been released by the Senate, and I
would just ask to the chair and ranking I would love to work
with you on this issue because it was extremely difficult to
get the Kenyans to stand up and say they would lead a
multinational security effort.
And yet, they did stand up because of the U.S. indication
that we would be providing funding for it, and that funding is
withheld right now, and that really threatens whether the
Kenyans will be able to do what they have agreed to do in
tandem with the Haitian government.
So I hope we can work on the committee both on the--getting
an ambassador but also on getting the multinational security
support mission up and funded, because this is not just about
hunger and instability in Haiti.
It is 700 miles from the United States, and we have seen
some of the challenges around migration and immigration are
driven by instability in Haiti.
But turning to the food security issue, the World Food
Programme says that food insecurity impacts about half the
population in Haiti, making it one of the most food insecure
countries in the world, certainly in the hemisphere. Rainfall
deficit, flooding, have damaged crops, and gang violence
disrupts agriculture, trade, commerce, distribution of food.
Can you share how the U.S. is working to counter these
negative impacts and promote more food security in Haiti? And I
would direct that question either to Dr. Fowler or Ms.
Esposito.
Ms. Esposito. Thanks.
That is really sort of a two part question in the sense
that we have life saving humanitarian aid going on through the
Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance working with the U.N. World
Food Programme to get food parcels out through pre-positioned
sites as well as nutrition interventions to help stave off
acute malnutrition.
On the development side this is what we call a resilience
focus country, trying to work in places where you have high
fragility, high risk of urgent humanitarian need, and we are
trying to develop local markets and local food production to
help Haitians grow their own food, and we are also working on
water management commissions.
So connecting the food security objectives and the water
security objectives, and also working on fortified foods, wheat
flour substitutions that have nutritional value.
All of these programs tend to be taking place well outside
the urban areas where most of the challenges right now are
ongoing, although we know that area is spreading.
It is a very dynamic situation. I would need to check to
see if those programs are continuing at this point or whether--
because of insecurity. I know the humanitarian piece is going
on. The development portfolio is something I would have to get
back to you on.
Senator Kaine. Dr. Fowler, could you comment on Haiti at
all?
Dr. Fowler. Sure. I will just mention that Haiti is, in a
sense, a poster child for the confluence of conflict and
climate and the kinds of problems that that combination can
cause, both of which lead to national security issues for them,
and obviously, for us.
This is a sign of the kind of issues that we are going to
be facing, I think, more and more in other parts of the world.
Senator Kaine. Even as I am walking to the hearing today
there is news out about Haiti, about the instability of the
current government and requests that the current kind of acting
prime minister step down and what is the next step.
This is a situation that has devolved--if it is possible
for it to devolve it is evolving pretty quickly even right now,
and I hope that this is something that the committee might be
able to turn our attention to.
The Chairman. Thank you.
Senator Risch.
Senator Risch. Senator Kaine, the request for that funding
the Four Corners have signed off on, and I have to tell you I
had reluctance, and let me tell you my reluctance.
Nobody told me what this is for. I mean, there needs to be
a plan going forward. Your description of the situation--
apparently the two prisons they have got attacked this weekend,
and they let thousands of prisoners out.
So I do not know. I mean, we all want to do something about
it, but somebody needs to tell us what the money is going to go
for, what a path forward is there for, and you have described
the situation as bleak. I think that is probably an
understatement of what is going on there.
The Chairman. The signoff was for, I believe, $10 million,
which was a partial amount. There is still additional resources
they are needing--needed for the Kenyans to be able to go into
Haiti, but there are some legal issues in regards to their
going in. So this is an issue that we need to pay attention to.
In regards to the Ambassador that has been approved by our
committee. That is on the floor. So we have floor issues when
bringing up nominations, something that we have talked about.
Senator Kaine. My hope would be--I was aware that some of
the funding had been released and there had been signoff for
it.
Senator Risch, your question about how will the additional
funding be used, obviously, a very fair question. I mean, we
are seeing this horrible devolution there. There are dollars
available. The Kenyans have agreed to step up to provide some
security that should be helpful.
I just would hope the Administration could work with us to
provide answers to the questions you have because if the
Kenyans do not stand up this security force, nobody else has
yet shown a willingness to take lead.
So while we have somebody who is willing, and they have
their legal issues to work through, I hope we can get answers
to your questions so that we cannot lose the opportunity.
Senator Risch. And your point is well taken about the fact
that our interests--the United States national interest--is
concern for our own security because they are so close, and
with that kind of instability we all know what they are going
to do. If you live there you would want to come to the United
States.
And so I think probably whoever is--the Administration, if
they are going to come up with a request they need to really
tie it in to how it helps our security here.
So thank you.
The Chairman. Ms. Esposito, I understand that you wanted to
give some additional response in regards to Senator Young's
question on AI.
Ms. Esposito. I think that we
.
The Chairman. Your mic is not on.
Ms. Esposito. There is a lot of work and room for growth on
the AI side, and we do have analytics teams that are working on
a whole range of modeling, and I would be happy to provide
further details to him in writing.
I do know that one of our innovation labs at Pennsylvania
State is using AI now as part of our agenda to really help
farmers cope with the changing climate. As it gets warmer and
hotter we see evermore pests and diseases emerging in farmers'
fields, and we have AI tools that are being used.
People can access them on their mobile phone to very
rapidly identify what that pest or disease is and get immediate
advice on how to treat it. That is a very practical kind of
field level example of the kind of, I think, really powerful
transformation that AI can have.
When people have the power of that information right in
their phone and do not have to wait for an extension worker to
show up in some really remote place, you are going to have--I
think it is a really important area that we need to be looking
more at.
The Chairman. The committee will keep the record open until
close of business tomorrow for questions for the record that
may be asked by members of the committee. We would ask that you
respond promptly to those questions.
And we thank you very much, not only for your being here
today but what do you do every day to deal with this human
rights challenge that we have globally.
Clearly, U.S. leadership is indispensable. We need to do
more and we need to get others to do more, and we have to find
more efficient ways to do our work, and technology can
certainly help us solve some of these challenges.
With that, the hearing will be adjourned. Thank you all
very much.

Additional Material Submitted for the Record
Responses of Ms. Dina Esposito to Questions
Submitted by Senator Benjamin L. Cardin
Question. Forecasting: As environmental shifts due to climate
change are increasingly affecting millions across the world, it is
crucial to utilize forecasting in order to adapt programming to address
the shocks and stresses affecting food security.
How is forecasting data and predictive science utilized to
determine programming priorities when it comes to building food
security capacities?
Answer. USAID's Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET)
Program develops climate forecasts every six to 12 months, allowing
USAID to project the number of people who will be acutely food insecure
8 months in advance. These forecasts help decisionmakers prioritize
limited humanitarian resources to support the most vulnerable
communities as well as take action early to respond to growing
humanitarian needs before they further devolve into humanitarian and
security crises. FEWS NET forecasts are also used to inform USAID
Missions' Country Development Cooperation Strategies, particularly in
terms of managing climate shocks.
Additionally, to build the capacity of host countries to generate
accurate forecasts, USAID's FEWS NET program also leverages 3-D printed
automated weather systems (3D-PAWS) through the ``Enhancing
Meteorological Networks Partnership'' activity. Through this activity,
USAID is partnering with 10 African countries to strengthen their
capacity to report weather station data and integrate it with satellite
observations to improve climate, weather, and acute food insecurity
forecasts. This data helps governments make strategic decisions about
their resources and also contributes to FEWS NET's early warning
efforts.
USAID Bureau for Resilience, Environment, and Food Security (REFS)
is also implementing a range of forward-looking analyses which aim to
inform programmatic decisionmaking. First, REFS is supporting a series
of investment prioritization analyses that will highlight the most
effective interventions for reducing poverty and hunger between now and
2030. Second, REFS is developing a series of crop suitability maps to
illustrate how the best locations for cropped agriculture may change
between now and 2040 as a result of a changing climate. Finally, REFS
has built the capacity of key partners to conduct forward-looking
scenario analysis when global shocks occur. In previous iterations of
this work, modeling COVID-19 and Ukraine invasion impacts has helped
REFS determine program priorities.
For example, the USAID-National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) SERVIR program is working together with partner
organizations and governments around the world to unlock and
demonstrate the potential for using earth observations in support of
food security. The SERVIR partnership harnesses the unique vantage
point from space to monitor and manage carbon across diverse landscapes
so that countries are better able to manage natural resources and
reduce land-based greenhouse gas emissions. SERVIR also works to
strengthen climate adaptation, including support to micro insurance
products for women farmers, improved drought and flood early warning
systems, and air quality monitoring and alerts. In turn, these
investments, collaborations, and technology transfers support food and
water security, and ultimately improve lives and secure livelihoods.
SERVIR's collaborative approach helps individuals, organizations, and
governments to develop and sustain decision support solutions for
improved climate mitigation and climate adaptation. USAID's climate
strategy will help push SERVIR and other interventions to lead on the
promise of applied technology to advance the transformational changes
needed to mitigate and adapt to the climate crisis.
USAID missions around the world are also investing in AI-related
efforts in three broad categories: (1) data provision, including data
capture and building data providers' capacity; (2) decision-focused
support to support improved decisionmaking and planning; and (3)
learning, aimed at synthesizing lessons, good practices, barriers, and
opportunities related to USAID programming. Climate information
services have played a significant role in informing sound, evidence-
based decisionmaking across many USAID activities. Expanding access to
Information services, including providing farmers with advanced notice
of weather patterns are already making a difference. Farmers in Rwanda,
for example, who had access to weather information and took related
action, increased yields by 47 percent and their income rose by 56
percent.
Question. How are relief and development institutions accounting
for the effects of climate change on food production, and natural
resource scarcity?
Answer. USAID's FEWS NET Program monitors the effects of climate
change on crop productivity and resource scarcity globally. The effects
of climate change on crop production are highlighted in FEWS NET's
monthly Seasonal Forecast reviews. For example, anthropogenic warming
of the western Pacific Ocean has been demonstrated to amplify the
drought impacts of La Nina events in the Horn of Africa, which drove
the recent historic five failed rainy seasons in the eastern Horn,
nearly resulting in Famine in Somalia. FEWS NET has been instrumental
in supporting the US government and vulnerable countries around the
world to understand the El Nino phenomenon and the impacts it has on
agriculture, whether by flooding or drought.
USAID also supports early warning systems, including those that
address drought risks, which may translate to natural resource
scarcity, namely via water resource issues. In support of the U.N.
Secretary-General's Early Warning For All (EW4ALL) initiative, USAID
made an initial investment of $67 million to support early warning
systems beginning in 2022 and plans to invest over $78 million
providing communities at risk of climate disasters with access to
effective early warning systems by 2027. Many of these climate
disasters may contribute to increased pressures on critical natural
resources such as water, and actionable early warnings help decrease
the loss of human lives and livelihoods due to hazardous climate
events.
USAID accounts for the effects of climate change on natural
resource scarcity through climate risk management during natural
resource management activity design and implementation. These processes
assess and address the climate risks to natural resources through risk
management options such as integrating climate information and
considerations into fisheries management and forest management plans.
In addition, USAID is developing climate-resilient biodiversity
programming guidance specific to the biodiversity conservation
portfolio.
Helping farmers adapt to a changing climate is a central component
of the Global Food Security Strategy. This includes investing heavily
in a wide range of research to help farmers adapt to a changing
environment, such as development of more weather tolerant and
nutritious crops, improved animal genetics and new technologies.
Investments also include improving access to better soil maps and
improved on-farm cropping practices to grow more food despite a
changing climate. The Vision for Adapted Crops and Soils, led by the
State Department as part of Feed the Future, specifically shines a
spotlight on the importance of improving seeds for nutrient dense crops
and soil health under changing weather conditions and is attracting
more donors to this space. We also work to scale access to information
to inform smallholder farmers on weather conditions, improve access to
insurance and other risk reducing financial products, and support
access to small-scale irrigation where appropriate. In addition, we
partner with private sector companies supporting their engagement with
smallholder farmers in order to build sustainable supply chains and
increase farmer access to improved technologies and improve incomes.
These are just a few examples of how the Feed the Future portfolio is
responding.
Question. How are climate science and climate forecasting and
modeling being used to modify and keep assistance ahead of the curve in
terms of preparedness and adaptive capacities to the effects of climate
change?
Answer. Climate science and forecasting are at the heart of the
agro-climatological working assumptions. Through a variety of
partnerships, including with NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the
Climate Hazards Center at UC Santa Barbara, and the University of
Maryland, USAID is able to use long- and short-term forecasts to plan
and adapt. For example, USAID considers major climate models like the
El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) first, since these models can
signal significant shifts in precipitation patterns months in advance.
FEWS NET is a regular consumer of 8-month ENSO forecasts from the NOAA
Climate Prediction Center, as well as experimental 24-month ENSO
forecasts from the NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory.
As a country's growing season nears within three-to-four months,
FEWS NET begins regularly reviewing seasonal climate forecasts that are
produced each month by major climate science centers around the world.
These forecasts can be used to indicate the relative probabilities of
above- and below-average precipitation and temperatures in the coming
months and can contribute to multi-month forecasts of variables like
soil moisture, snowpack, and streamflow. Additionally, once the season
is underway, FEWS NET uses Seasonal-to-Subseasonal (S2S) forecasts,
which go weeks beyond the 14-day outlooks of conventional weather
forecasts.
USAID also works with host country National Meteorological and
Hydrological Services, along with NOAA and World Meteorological
Organizations to support climate monitoring and enable the use of
climate forecasts in planning and early action. These interventions
enable host countries to advance or establish delivery of climate
services to aid in planning and preparing for and reducing impact of
climate related hazards.
Question. Private Sector: The U.S. has worked multilaterally with
institutions such as the United Nations, World Food Program and the
World Bank to combat food insecurity.
How are you working with the private sector to improve food
security and assist in the development of climate management
strategies, aimed at improving developing countries' resilience?
Answer. USAID is working with private sector actors in many ways.
For example, through the President's Emergency Plan for Adaptation and
Resilience (PREPARE), the USAID Administrator and the State Department
issued a Call to Action to the Private Sector to make commitments
supporting climate adaptation in 2022 at COP27. To date, 31 companies
have joined this call and their collective commitments are anticipated
to mobilize an estimated $2.3 billion in additional adaptation finance.
The founding companies of the PREPARE Call to Action from COP27 are
Google, Gro Intelligence, Mastercard, Marsh McLennan, Meta, Microsoft,
Pegasus Capital Advisors, PepsiCo., SAP, and WTW (formerly Willis
Towers Watson). The 26 additional commitments made in 2023 came from
Aon, Arup, Boston Consulting Group, Blue Marble, Danone, Howden Group,
IBM, Jupiter Intelligence, Milliman, Miyamoto International, Synoptic
Data, Tomorrow.io, Visa, Xylem, as well as McCormick and Pula who
joined during Vice President Harris' visit to Africa in 2023.
Additionally, ClimateWorks Foundation, Global Adaptation and Resilience
Investment (GARI) Working Group, Lightsmith Group, MSCI Sustainability
Institute, and Bezos Earth Fund are now part of the call to action.
To advise USAID on how to steer agricultural development toward
lower emissions pathways, the Agency commissioned a report by the Board
for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD) on how to
``Achieve Transformative Adaptation and Mitigation in Agricultural and
Food Systems.'' The Bureau for Resilience, Environment and Food
Security is currently reviewing the recommendations for possible
adoption by USAID. A number of the report's recommendations and
suggested monitoring and evaluation targets touch on the private
sector, including identifying and working with private sector partners
to crowd in investment, solicit complementary expertise, and set up
interventions to scale. Private sector finance is also anticipated to
account for 30 percent of the report's recommended climate finance
target.
Question. How is the U.S. working with agriculture and food
production supply chains to reduce their greenhouse gas footprints?
Answer. USAID is currently addressing methane emissions in the
agri-food sector through three main pathways: dairy productivity
improvement, rice productivity improvement, and food loss and waste
reduction.
For example, (1) USAID's dairy productivity improvement program in
Kenya contributed to reducing methane emission intensity of cows by 28
percent while increasing milk productivity by 43 percent. This was
achieved by simply improving the diet of the cows. (2) USAID is
partnering with Bayer Crop Science and the International Rice Research
Institute to introduce climate-smart rice varieties and promote the
adoption of low-emission rice cultivation practices. This partnership
is expected to achieve 20 percent of water savings and a 30 to 50
percent reduction of methane emissions. (3) USAID recently awarded a
Climate Resilient Agriculture program in Vietnam that will also support
the reduction of methane emissions in the rice sector while increasing
rice productivity. (4) USAID is partnering with Regen Organics, a
Kenyan private firm, to transform food waste into value-added products
such as protein-rich animal feed and organic fertilizers. Through this
partnership, USAID is preventing the emission of 760 tons of methane
that would have occurred had the food waste been sent to landfills.
USAID has also made significant investments in supporting bilateral
partners and their private sectors in transitioning toward low-emission
agricultural value chains. For example:
Amazonia Connect is led by Solidaridad in collaboration with Earth
Innovation Institute, National Wildlife Federation, and the University
of Wisconsin Madison. It works in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru to reduce
emissions and conserve biodiversity in cattle, dairy, coffee, and palm
oil supply chains. Approaches include providing large-scale technical
assistance to farmers for deforestation-free production; supply chain
traceability and transparency, including to meet EU Deforestation
Regulation requirements; providing information to private sector
companies using machine-learning and AI tools to improve sustainable
sourcing decisions; unlocking blended finance and incentives for
conservation that reach farmers; and supporting regional-level
governments to advance their low-emissions rural development
strategies.
The Forest Data Partnership, led by World Resources Institute and
in collaboration with Google, Unilever, the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations, and National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) strengthens application and collaboration around
global monitoring of commodity-driven deforestation, forest degradation
and restoration efforts across the globe. The partnership focuses on
key geographies, including the Amazon Basin, Southeast Asia and West
Africa. It aims to halt and reverse forest loss from commodity
production by collaboratively improving global monitoring and supply
chain tracking and accelerating restoration. The partnership helps to
align partners around global forest monitoring data and ensures
stakeholder access to consistent, validated open-source geospatial
forest-risk commodity data. The result is credible, systematic
monitoring, verification and accountability toward reducing commodity-
driven deforestation and restoring degraded lands.
The Business Case for Collective Landscape Action, led by The
Rainforest Alliance and including partners Conservation International,
CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), and Clarmondial aims to
support sustainable agricultural commodity production through a three
part approach: (1) promoting landscape-scale sustainable production and
planning; (2) connecting this to international disclosure platforms;
and (3) using this to leverage financing for high performing and low-
emissions landscapes. The activity is being piloted across Amazonia and
Southeast Asia, including pilots in Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil,
and Indonesia. The ultimate goals of the activity are to unlock
international finance for sustainable production, channel it to well-
planned landscapes, and stabilize critically deforestation frontiers
globally.

Responses of Ms. Dina Esposito to Questions
Submitted by Senator James E. Risch
food aid reform
Question. U.S. cargo preference requirements make food aid
delivered through the Food for Peace and Emerson Trust programs too
slow and too expensive. The requirements were put in place under the
Eisenhower administration to protect U.S. maritime security. Now, 70
years later, they serve as unjustified subsidy for a single U.S.
commercial operator.
Does the Biden Administration support exempting emergency food aid
from U.S. cargo preference rules, which could save USAID an estimated
$80 million in transport costs and enable the agency to reach more
people, more quickly, at less expense? If not, why not?
Answer. At present, USAID is able to meet our humanitarian mandate
while complying with requirements within the Cargo Preference Act.
However, over the past year, the number of people in need of
humanitarian assistance has increased by more than a third, and the
Agency welcomes congressional engagement to ensure that USAID is able
to continue to deliver lifesaving assistance efficiently.
Question. Understanding that the three remaining bulk carriers in
the U.S. commercial fleet that carry food aid are not militarily
useful, how can this single-beneficiary subsidy continue to be
justified?
Answer. USAID is limited by the number of bulk vessels that are
able to carry our food aid cargoes overseas. Today, there are only four
bulk vessels owned by two corporations operating under the U.S. flag.
Because of the limited number of bulk vessels available, USAID did not
receive U.S. flag offers for 33 percent of our bulk cargoes in fiscal
year 2023. USAID continues to be supportive of efforts to increase the
size of the U.S. flag fleet; however, it is our understanding that the
dry bulk carriers are not considered militarily useful to the
Department of Defense. Increasing the number of U.S. flag ships could
lead to increased market competition, more choices, and lower prices
for transporting life-saving assistance.
food aid diversion
Question. The diversion of food aid to benefit malign governments,
warlords, terrorists, and criminals in places like Ethiopia, Somalia,
Sudan, and Yemen is wholly unacceptable.
What specific efforts has the U.S. Government taken to improve
oversight and accountability of food assistance, so we can make sure it
reaches those in need and is not diverted?
Answer. USAID takes diversion issues very seriously and places the
highest priority on ensuring that our assistance is safely reaching
those most in need and that funds are used wisely, effectively, and for
their intended purpose.
In 2023, USAID's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA)
established a Program Oversight Working Group to address diversion
risks globally, building on current risk mitigation practices. This
group oversees the following lines of effort for humanitarian
assistance programs implemented globally, including:
Developing a list of countries at high risk of significant
diversions and identifying patterns and trends from major aid
diversion;
Improving staff capability to mitigate diversion risk. For
example, in coordination with our Office of Inspector General (OIG),
USAID implemented a mandatory annual fraud awareness briefing for all
Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance staff;
Improving the effectiveness of third party monitoring
(TPM) to detect different types of diversion schemes; and,
Improving partner risk mitigation efforts by expanding
program-specific requirements for risk assessment and management plans,
as well as reviewing and updating partner guidance. For countries that
are at high-risk of diversion, USAID expanded the requirements for
partners--both NGO's and U.N. agencies--to assess a broader set of
risks, including diversion, and to strengthen mitigation measures
across all programs.
As part of USAID's effort to combat diversion, USAID also supported
the development of the World Food Program's (WFP) Reassurance Action
Plan, which strengthens WFP's oversight practices to mitigate the risks
of fraud and diversion and to identify and address wrongdoing when it
occurs. We remain committed to working with our colleagues to
facilitate the successful implementation of this plan.
USAID continues to engage our partners on how we can support their
efforts to improve program oversight and accountability and mitigate
the risk of diversions.
Question. What specifically are you demanding of U.N. agencies and
other U.S. implementers to prevent diversion?
Answer. As part of their applications for funding, USAID requires
that humanitarian partners submit a Risk Assessment and Management Plan
(RAMP). Through these plans, all applicants must demonstrate that they
have assessed the risks of fraud (including diversion), waste, abuse,
and other misuses of U.S. Government resources and have sufficient
measures in place to mitigate those risks. Following the establishment
of BHA's Program Oversight Working Group in 2023, USAID established a
list of countries that are at high risk of significant diversion. For
these countries, USAID has expanded the risk mitigation requirements
for both NGO and U.N. partners to assess a broader set of risks,
including diversion, and strengthen mitigation measures across all
programs. Further, USAID humanitarian staff are required to assess
country-level risks and related risk mitigation measures at least
annually for countries that are designated at high risk of diversion.
BHA includes requirements in all awards for partners to report any
instances of program irregularities such as suspected fraud, waste, or
abuse, including allegations of diversion. Partners fulfill their award
requirements by reporting these allegations to Agreement Officers,
Agreement Officer Representatives, and the USAID OIG. These reporting
channels are critical because they allow the OIG to investigate
allegations and USAID to take swift action to safeguard resources.
Additionally, given that the World Food Program is USAID's largest
food assistance partner, USAID is closely monitoring the World Food
Program (WFP) implementation of the Global Assurance Framework and
Reassurance Action Plan (RAP), an agency-wide reform effort that
describes specific actions that WFP will take in high-risk operations
in 2024 to strengthen its global accountability and oversight. USAID
will use its position on the WFP Executive Board to closely follow
WFP's implementation of the RAP in order to encourage strong uptake of
the reforms at the country level, ensure prioritization of the reforms
at the corporate level, and facilitate real-time feedback from USAID to
WFP headquarters on both progress and challenges to implementation.
legislative proposals--food security
Question. A bill has been introduced to create a private
foundation, funded by the U.S. Government, to leverage private
investment and close gaps in food security. Several U.S. agencies and
international organizations have the capacity to partner with the
private sector, but too many agribusinesses have found them to be
wholly inaccessible.
Given current budget realities, creating a new U.S.-government
funded entity absent buy-in from other public donors inevitably will
reduce the amount of U.S. foreign assistance available to support
existing international food security programs. It could also increase
bureaucratic burdens, duplication, and waste.
Do the benefits of creating a new entity to leverage private sector
finance for food security outweigh the risks? How could those risks be
mitigated?
Answer. USAID is supportive of efforts to leverage the private
sector to invest more in agriculture. We know that we cannot address
global hunger and malnutrition with public dollars alone. Additional
long-term funding for global food security through the establishment of
this foundation could be an impressive new tool. We have appreciated
the opportunity to engage with Senators on this bill so we can ensure
that it complements ongoing USAID efforts.
If established we want to work with this new foundation to ensure
that USG efforts are aligned for maximum impact. This includes in Feed
the Future target countries where we are doubling down on Feed the
Future's core mandate by concentrating bilateral investments in several
countries that we know are most in need and are best poised for
regional agricultural-led economic growth. Already, we've identified a
subset of Feed the Future target countries in Southern Africa that,
with adequate investment, could give rise to a new regional breadbasket
for the continent.
By coupling our investments with a focused, trade-centric policy
reform agenda and increased investment from other donors and the
private sector, we can drive equitable, regional growth with an
emphasis on women and marginalized communities.
As much as we would be excited about a new institution and
additional funding going toward solving hunger, we would want to work
with the Congress to maintain critical funding for Feed the Future, in
order to avoid the reduction or elimination of critical food security
activities around the world.
Question. What would be the impact of cutting USAID's budget for
food security by $100 million annually in order to make room for this
new investment?
Answer. A $100 million reduction to the budget for Feed the Future,
an initiative with a strong evidence base demonstrating significant
impact over the last decade, could constrain USAID's ability to
concentrate bilateral investments in several countries that we know are
most in need and are best poised for regional agricultural-led economic
growth. It could also result in reducing up to 18 bilateral FTF
programs, including Egypt, Lebanon, Colombia, Sri Lanka, and Peru,
among others, and some programs could need to be closed out.
Question. Would opening more funding opportunities for new or
expanded public-private partnerships with existing foundations be a
reasonable alternative to building a new entity from the ground up?
Answer. The U.S. cannot solve hunger alone. USAID welcomes any new
opportunity to bring in additional funding, resources, and attention to
solving this important issue. That is why partnering with the private
sector--and strengthening the capacity of the enabling environment in
which it operates--is a critically important part of USAID's and Feed
the Future's (FTF) approach.
Through Feed the Future, USAID has expanded its partnerships with
private companies, and in fiscal year 2022 USAID leveraged almost $700
million in financial commitments from the private sector. FTF has set
ambitious future targets for financial leveraging that signals our
commitment to doing even more. We are committed to partnering with both
private sector and foundation partners because we know it will be
essential to improve agricultural productivity, build food systems,
help alleviate poverty, reduce malnutrition, and drive economic growth
in developing countries.
Additionally, there are other avenues through which the U.S.
Government works to partner with the private sector. The Global
Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) is an important part of
the multilateral food security financing architecture and remains an
agile, effective, and relevant mechanism to channel donor resources to
the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) as demonstrated by its
swift response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to the impacts stemming
from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
GAFSP's private sector window uses blended finance solutions to
invest in projects that may not attract commercial funding due to
perceived high risks in the agricultural sector. GAFSP's private sector
window uniquely combines concessional financial products, in-demand
advisory services, and high commercial and governance standards. The
Private Sector Window provides affordable funding with less demanding
terms allowing investment in early stage or riskier projects in some of
the world's lowest income countries and fragile and conflict-affected
states. On average, GAFSP private sector window projects leverage 1.9
times funding from IFC and 6.5 times in total financing.
Question. How do you propose making existing U.S. and U.N.
mechanisms for public-private partnerships and development finance more
accessible to the private sector, so we can better harness innovation
and leverage private sector investment in resilient food systems?
Answer. Broadly, USAID is taking on some core reforms to make it
easier for the private sector to work with USAID and vice versa. We
recently launched a new network of relationship managers and industry
leads to deepen our relationship with key corporate partners and
industry associations. In May, we plan on unveiling the Agency's first
relationship management platform, Compass, that will for the first time
allow us to track all of our partnerships around the world through a
single integrated system.
We are also looking at core H.R. systems to make it easier to
attract talent from the private sector and to better incentivize
current staff to lean into partnerships. We have in the past year
developed new tools that make it easier to engage the private sector
faster and earlier in program design. We are also about to unveil a new
searchable website with all of our partnership data available to the
public for the first time. These and other operational changes are all
intended to make it possible for the Agency to really begin scaling its
engagement with the private sector across all sectors by improving the
partner experience.
Finally, USAID launched the new Enterprises for Development,
Growth, and Empowerment (EDGE) Fund last year. The EDGE Fund is a
flexible fund that lowers bureaucratic barriers and enables USAID to
move at the speed of the private sector. There is a co-investment
component, where the ratio of private sector resources to USAID's
should be at least 1:1. It's been exciting to see the flurry of ideas
and private sector passion ignited within the Agency. A number of
projects are projected to leverage 10 private dollars for every 1
government dollar.
In general, U.S. and U.N. mechanisms should engage the private
sector early and often, particularly in the design and implementation
of strategies and projects of shared interests and values to advance
resilient food systems. Identifying areas of overlap with the private
sector is essential to incentivizing private sector actors to engage in
public-private partnerships.
In our partnerships with U.N. and other multilateral mechanisms to
advance food security globally--such as the Consultative Group on
International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), Global Agriculture and
Food Security Program (GAFSP), International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD), U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, and
Agriculture Market Information System (AMIS)--we will continue to push
these organizations to take steps to expand public-private partnerships
and harness private sector innovation and investment in resilient food
systems, as relevant to their respective mandates.
A comprehensive mapping of the existing food security financing
landscape may also support more public-private partnerships and
streamline areas of duplication.
For example, under its G20 Presidency this year, the Government of
Brazil has commissioned a report on funding and resource mobilization
to fight hunger and poverty, which aims to map all existing funding
sources, funds, institutions, and instruments at global and regional
levels that could be leveraged and galvanized to support the
implementation of trusted, impactful, and evidence-based country-level
policies. This report is expected to be released to G20 countries in
spring/summer 2024. While we have not seen the content of the report
yet, it could help identify new opportunities ripe for public-private
partnerships within existing multilateral mechanisms.
Question. Another introduced bill proposes to shift management of
Food for Peace to USDA, further reduce funds available for enabling/
complementary activities and program management, and eliminate support
for local and regional procurement of food.
How would enactment of these changes impact USAID's Food for Peace
development food aid programs?
Answer. Legislative proposals to reduce Food for Peace funds
available for enabling/complementary activities and program management,
authorized under Section 202(e) of the Food for Peace Act, as well as
proposals to eliminate support for local and regional procurement of
food would make food assistance programs exceedingly difficult to
implement. Non-emergency food assistance programs funded through the
Food for Peace Act are critical to help mitigate and prevent food
crises and reduce the future need for emergency aid.
Without sufficient program implementation funds from 202(e), USAID
and its partners would have to fund Food for Peace non-emergency
programs through monetization. Monetization is the process by which
implementing partners must sell U.S. commodities in local markets and
use sale proceeds to fund program implementation costs. The Government
Accountability Office (GAO) has found that monetization is highly
inefficient and leads to losses of nearly 25 cents on the dollar,
reducing the number of people reached with aid. Further, USAID relies
on 202(e) funding to implement programs to prevent and treat
malnutrition. For example, USAID provides U.S.-produced ready-to-use
therapeutic food (RUTF) to treat children suffering from wasting, the
deadliest form of malnutrition. However, because treatment using RUTF
must be done in a clinical setting with trained health workers, program
implementation costs are higher than general food distributions.
Limiting 202(e) funding limits USAID's ability to fund these lifesaving
programs, putting children's lives at risk.
While U.S. commodities have an important role in U.S. food aid
programs, particularly in places where markets are non-functional or
there is insufficient food supply to meet food needs, local and
regional procurement can also provide critical flexibility when USAID
faces unforeseen circumstances. For example, in fiscal year 2022, while
USAID purchased 99.9 percent Title II food assistance commodities in
the United States, a single local procurement in Madagascar was able to
keep food assistance programs running temporarily when U.S. commodities
were impacted by shipping delays.
Finally, by requiring the consent of the Secretary of Agriculture
for emergency food assistance programs, budgeting decisions would be
split across two Federal agencies. As the President's Special
Coordinator for International Disaster Assistance, USAID has the
experience, global presence, and connections to analyze needs and
deliver food assistance effectively when disasters strike. Adding more
bureaucratic hurdles would only delay the delivery of urgently needed
food assistance.
food security and wash
Question. This year marks the 8-year anniversary of the Global Food
Security Act and the 10-year anniversary of the Water for the World
Act. The most recent reauthorization of the Global Food Security Act
recognizes that achieving food and nutrition security objectives is
highly dependent upon access to safe drinking water and improved
sanitation and hygiene.
How is the Bureau for Resilience, Environment, and Food Security
(REFS) working to align the Global Food Security Strategy with the U.S.
Global Water Strategy, including by incorporating WASH into its food
security programming?
Answer. Guided by REFS strategies and technical assistance, USAID
Missions are implementing programs, co-funded by water and food
security resources, that aim to advance both strategies with a single
approach. For example, in arid Northern Kenya, water security--and
therefore food security--has decreased rapidly over the past decade.
This has resulted in livestock death and conflict between pastoralists
and farmers. To address this growing water insecurity, USAID, the Swiss
Government, and civil society partners launched the Kenya Resilient
Arid Lands Partnership for Integrated Development (RAPID) program, co-
funded by the water directive and Feed the Future funds. RAPID worked
closely with the public sector, private sector, and communities in
drought prone areas to improve access to reliable and clean water for
people, crops, and livestock. By working with local water departments
to upgrade water systems, more than 460,000 people gained improved
access to drinking water; the partnership also worked with pastoral
communities to improve management of water resources and rangelands,
mitigating current local conflicts and preventing future ones.
Additionally, USAID recently launched the ``Feed the Future Water
and Food Systems for Resilient Communities Activity'' in the Karamoja
region of Uganda, one of the poorest regions in sub-Saharan Africa.
Karamoja suffers from recurrent drought and conflict that contributes
to food emergencies. After years of humanitarian response, this program
is bridging into longer-term development to reduce future humanitarian
burden and improve water and food security over the long term. The
activity will strengthen local capacity to manage watersheds, water
utilities, and water and sanitation markets; and invest in water
infrastructure like agricultural water storage and piped water systems
that will lead to more efficient use of limited water for people and
food production. This combined approach aims to improve local capacity
to manage expected weather-related shocks and stressors through
improved governance.
The Global Food Security Act recognizes the importance of water
resources management (WRM) to agricultural outcomes, and the role safe
drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) play in nutrition. The
2022 Global Food Security Strategy (GFSS) reinforces these directives
from Congress through a Cross-Cutting Intermediate Result on water
resources management; and Intermediate Result 9, which aims to create
more hygienic environments through WASH. These priorities echo
approaches promoted in the U.S. Global Water Strategy and its
supporting technical guidance. To support USAID Missions and partners
to further scale up these investments in the countries that implement
the majority of funding for food and water security, REFS has developed
technical guidance on the intersection of water and agriculture, to
drive improved collaboration to protect watersheds; strengthen national
and local level cooperation over water; and ensure strong governance is
in place to protect water resources for multiple users, including for
drinking and farming. Further, multiple Centers within REFS are
supporting research, innovative tools, and modeling and forecasting,
such as with hydro-meteorological data, which provide a comprehensive
package of data for decisionmaking to USAID Missions and partner
governments, and enable USAID to continue improving investments in food
and water systems. InterAgency collaborations, such as with the U.S.
Geological Survey, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and NASA,
increase the collective resources available to better integrate water
and sanitation into food security programs.

Responses of Ms. Dina Esposito to Questions
Submitted by Senator Todd Young
Question. Please provide your assessment of how AI can and should
be deployed to better predict both:
Agricultural shortages, due to issues like water scarcity,
natural disasters, or quality of cropland AND
Global supply route disruptions and the cascading effect
of logistical and transportation disruptions to food supplies for
countries who heavily rely on imports?
Answer. USAID leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods such
as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to
further our work around food security.
As an example, ML and NLP AI contribute significantly to the early
warning systems predicting emergency food insecurity produced by
USAID's Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). By processing
complex environmental conditions and agricultural data from satellites,
AI helps analysts forecast how many people will be at risk of emergency
food insecurity due to environmental variability, conflict, and
economic crisis. This analysis provides evidence to support decisions
about allocation of humanitarian assistance, preventing food crises in
regions most affected by climate change.
With sufficient data inputs, robustly tested generative AI (GenAI)
models have the potential to support prediction of agricultural
shortages and global supply route disruptions. We have begun to assess
the abilities of GenAI models to support our work and enable USAID to
make more data-driven, targeted, and timely responses to shifts in the
global landscape. This will require dedicated investments to develop,
test, and refine GenAI models and source relevant datasets. With the
right investments we could leverage GenAI to build upon or enhance our
existing work with AI, or where necessary, develop new approaches.
USAID missions around the world are also investing in AI-related
efforts in three broad categories: (1) data provision, including data
capture and building data providers' capacity; (2) decision-focused
support to support improved decisionmaking and planning; and (3)
learning, aimed at synthesizing lessons, good practices, barriers, and
opportunities related to USAID programming. Information services
focused on shifting environmental conditions to provide advanced notice
of weather patterns have played a significant role in informing sound,
evidence-based decisionmaking across many USAID activities. In Rwanda,
for example, farmers increased yields by 47 percent and their income
from crops by 56 percent.
Question. What, if any, resources from Congress could assist your
respective department and agency to more rapidly integrate AI-supported
predictions into your analysis of the next food insecurity crisis?
Answer. USAID's Bureau for Resilience, Environment, and Food
Security has already begun making investments to understand and test
the potential of GenAI in our analyses. While the Bureau recognizes the
potential of GenAI, and the proven value of NLP and ML, for this
purpose, in order for USAID to fully benefit from the potential of AI,
we will need to develop or acquire technical expertise both in
Washington and in our Missions. As this is a fast growing industry,
USAID would need time and resources to build the necessary team of AI
experts, data scientists and dedicated staff required to successfully
integrate AI into our analyses and operations at both the Agency and
country level.
We also would benefit from support for the development and
deployment of AI models and tools for this type of analysis in future
year funding. As one example of what is possible, USAID has recently
had conversations with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA) and the team that they supported to develop the World Modelers
program. Tools such as this one have the potential to enable USAID to
leverage AI to enable predictive modeling. However, they require
sufficient and dedicated financial resources for upkeep and refinement.
USAID's FEWS NET currently uses ML AI for its routine operations;
however, due to funding constraints amid historic global needs, FEWS
NET is focusing on maintaining current programming. If given the
opportunity, FEWS NET could continue to build on existing, longstanding
investments and expertise, particularly in the environment, weather and
agricultural sectors, as well as scaling up FEWS NET's newer work in
the area of fragility, instability, climate security and conflict--
currently the top driver of acute food insecurity globally.
Question. How have disruptions to global supply chains impacted
your efforts to fight food insecurity? What steps are you taking to
ensure today's data on such disruptions will be incorporated into
developing and training future AI models to improve prediction
capabilities?
Answer. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the lingering effects of
the COVID-19 pandemic have had significant impacts on global commodity
prices, including food prices and input commodities such as fertilizer
which are important for achieving USAID's agricultural development
objectives. Recently, supply chain disruptions in the Red Sea and the
Panama Canal have required shipments to be rerouted, delaying
assistance and leading to increased transportation costs--though these
disruptions have yet to translate into higher prices for global
commodities.
We continue to monitor global supply chains and have invested in
research and modeling efforts with the International Food Policy
Research Institute (IFPRI) to understand the long-term impacts of
rising transportations costs and their impact on global commodity
prices. In addition, we continue to invest in the creation, curation,
and integration of datasets and indicators relevant for understanding
and documenting the complex relationships between global trade and food
security. These datasets are fundamental to developing and training
future AI models to ensure quality predictions.
For example, USAID's FEWS NET is partnering with IFPRI and NASA
Harvest at the University of Maryland to develop data-driven modeling
of the supply chain for selected agricultural commodities, from
agricultural production of wheat, maize, and rice; to these
commodities' market, trade and price dynamics; to logistics for both
commercial and humanitarian shipments of these commodities. The result
of this investment will be to improve FEWS NET's forecasting of acute
food insecurity in terms of the number of people forecast to be in need
of humanitarian food assistance, their location, the timing of need,
and the severity of need. USAID/FEWS NET has made an initial financial
and technical investment in this approach.

Responses of Ms. Dina Esposito to Questions
Submitted by Senator John Barrasso
Question. The United States is the largest humanitarian donor to
Ethiopia through the United States Agency for International Development
(USAID) and the World Food Program (WFP). In June 2023, USAID and WFP
paused all food assistance in Ethiopia. These actions were taken
following allegations of ``widespread and coordinated'' diversion of
humanitarian aid by Ethiopian officials and military elements.
According to U.N. human rights experts, the Ethiopian government
intentionally targeted food aid intended for individuals experiencing
famine-like conditions. This is a serious issue given the current
humanitarian situation which includes hundreds of hunger-related deaths
reported in 2023 and malnutrition rates above emergency thresholds in
certain regions.
What steps did USAID take to investigate the allegations that the
Ethiopian government intentionally denied and obstructed humanitarian
assistance to civilians? What were the results of your investigation?
Answer. USAID's independent Office of Inspector General (OIG)
opened an investigation into the allegations following the discovery of
diversion in 2023. We understand that the investigation remains
ongoing. We would refer you to the USAID OIG for any additional
questions on the results of the investigation.
Question. How is the US holding those individuals found responsible
for the diversion of humanitarian assistance accountable?
Answer. When responsible individuals are identified, USAID is
committed to working with the interagency to hold these individuals
accountable. USAID is cooperating fully with the independent USAID OIG
investigation; we understand that their investigation remains ongoing.
Question. What specific reforms did USAID implement to ensure
accountability of humanitarian aid in Ethiopia?
Answer. USAID takes diversion issues very seriously and places the
highest priority on ensuring that our assistance is safely reaching
those most in need and that we and our partners use funds wisely,
effectively, and for their intended purpose. This is evidenced by the
immediate action taken by USAID in 2023 to pause food assistance and
push for immediate, widespread, and substantial reforms of the food
assistance system in Ethiopia. USAID demanded changes from both the
Government of Ethiopia (GoE) and our humanitarian implementing
partners:
goe reforms
The GoE:
handed over responsibility for the management of
warehouses, commodities, and distributions to humanitarian partners in
all settings in which they were implementing USAID-funded food aid;
agreed to accept vulnerability-based targeting (VBT) as
the means to identify and approve beneficiaries throughout the country;
agreed to joint approval of master beneficiary lists with
humanitarian partners (instead of this being solely approved by the GoE
as had been done in the past);
committed to providing support and access to partners
conducting audits and spot-checks of grain markets, brokerages,
warehouses, and grinding mills; and
committed to investigating diversion and holding
perpetrators accountable.
partner reforms
Both USAID humanitarian food aid implementers:
committed to targeting beneficiaries via the process of
VBT, which helps ensure humanitarian assistance reaches those most in
need given limited resources;
improved commodity tracking by setting up real-time
tracking with GPS technology;
agreed to conduct digital beneficiary registration, such
as through ration cards with pictures that contain biographical
details; and
strengthened monitoring and oversight, such as by
increasing the number of roving monitoring and compliance staff,
requiring new training on diversion, improved reporting, and better
whistleblower protections.
As part of this reform effort, we supported the development of the
World Food Program's (WFP) Reassurance Action Plan, which strengthens
WFP's oversight practices to mitigate the risks of fraud and diversion
and to catch and address wrongdoing when it occurs. We remain committed
to working with our colleagues to facilitate the successful
implementation of this plan.
USAID has made changes to its own operating systems as well. For
example, USAID put in place a new third-party monitoring (TPM) contract
that ensures on-the-ground presence throughout Ethiopia. The TPM
contractor monitors markets and mills, looks for potential pre- and
post-distribution diversion, and evaluates supply chain management
systems. USAID has also recalibrated humanitarian food assistance to
align with needs reflected in VBT exercises so that limited
humanitarian resources only reach those most vulnerable.
Question. Are you confident that US humanitarian assistance is
currently going to those who need it most in Ethiopia?
Answer. We are confident that our strengthened risk mitigation
systems and the reformed food aid system in Ethiopia are less
vulnerable to manipulation. The Government of Ethiopia has handed over
responsibility for distribution and warehousing; our partners have
enhanced risk mitigation measures and are using VBT; and we are
conducting frequent site visits, as is the implementer of our new TPM
contract. The VBT process ensures that only those most in need are on
the final master beneficiary list and helps partners ensure aid is
going to those who need it most.
Question. Beyond immediate relief efforts, what is the strategy to
resolve the longer-term problem of food insecurity and malnutrition in
Ethiopia?
Answer. The United States remains the largest humanitarian donor to
Ethiopia. In 2023, the United States contributed more than $897 million
in humanitarian assistance, but the needs are staggering, and USAID
continues to call on other donors to scale up contributions in
Ethiopia, both for humanitarian and resilience programming.
In close coordination with emergency response programs, USAID is
implementing three Resilience Food Security Activities (RFSAs) in
Ethiopia, which are multi-year, multi-sectoral awards aimed toward
addressing the root causes of chronic food insecurity, reducing
poverty, building communities' resilience to shocks, and reducing the
need for reliance on emergency assistance in the long term. These
activities include livelihood diversification and income-generating
activities to reduce poverty, promote sustainable agriculture, and
access improved seeds to build food security and have been successful
in building lasting resilience among rural food-insecure populations.
These activities also strengthen community resilience through capacity
building and social protection mechanisms. USAID's work in Ethiopia
shows the importance of integrating short-term emergency responses with
broader development goals. Strategic assistance linking relief, market-
based assistance, private sector engagement, and livestock support
address the impact of drought and conflict while advancing development
and peace objectives.
Building on the above, USAID's economic growth activities in
Ethiopia layer with resilience activities to link market development to
enterprise development services in and beyond agriculture. This
improves access and availability of nutritious, safe, diverse foods
year-round. In addition to increasing market reach, activities also
support markets to become more resilient so that they continue to
function in the face of shocks and stressors. We are also focusing on
increasing capacity for smallholders and linking them to both domestic
and international markets.
The Ethiopian economy, however, cannot rely on agriculture alone
for increased incomes, poverty reduction, and private sector expansion.
To sustainably bolster food security, we must also address the
challenges that come with a rapidly growing youth population,
macroeconomic instability, and unemployment. This is why USAID
programming also focuses on building stable employment opportunities
for people under age 30, who make up more than two-thirds of the
population. For example, USAID activities aim to build on private
sector investments and experience in agriculture and water, sanitation,
and hygiene sectors, and promote entrepreneurial opportunities,
expanding job creation in sectors which demonstrate greater potential
for sustainable income and employment, such as light manufacturing.
These investments beyond agriculture work to further strengthen USAID's
food security interventions, especially in urban and peri-urban areas.
Through this combination of humanitarian response and resilience
activities, USAID works to help resolve food insecurity and
malnutrition in both the short and medium term.

Responses of Dr. Cary Fowler to Questions
Submitted by Senator Benjamin L. Cardin
Question. How is forecasting data and predictive science utilized
to determine programming priorities when it comes to building food
security capacities?
Answer. Core to the first pillar of the President's Emergency Plan
for Adaptation and Resilience (PREPARE) is a focus on deepening global
understanding of climate risks, vulnerabilities, and adaptation
solutions and applying those insights to food systems. Forecasting data
and predictive science, powered by AI, allow decisionmakers to promptly
analyze high resolution and high frequency data, enabling for the
identification of specific regions and communities at the highest risk
of food insecurity. This information helps prioritize resource
allocation and enact tailored intervention strategies including
investments in agricultural infrastructure, research, development, and
implementation of climate resilient seed varieties, and the
distribution of aid.
AI models can accurately predict natural disasters' impacts, food
security crises, and map supply chains prompting stakeholder responses.
Question. How are relief and development institutions accounting
for the effects of climate change on food production, and natural
resource scarcity?
Answer. When launched in 2021, the President's Emergency Plan for
Adaptation and Resilience (PREPARE) included a specific focus on food
security in light of the importance of building climate resilience into
our development and diplomatic programs to enhance effectiveness and
maintain development gains. In February 2023, the U.S. State
Department's Office of Global Food Security (OGFS) launched its Vision
for Adapted Crops and Soils (VACS) Initiative, in partnership with the
African Union (AU) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
U.N. (FAO). With an initial focus on African countries, VACS advances
agricultural productivity and nutrition by developing diverse, climate-
resilient crop varieties and building healthy soils. Since its
implementation, the OGFS has directed one-hundred million dollars
toward USAID crop and soil activities and undertaken a public-private
partnership to develop an initial research agenda focused on African
food crops. VACS also contributes to the food security work under
PREPARE.
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations
has prioritized investments in climate-resilient agriculture practices.
This includes promoting drought-resistant crops, improving water
management techniques, and implementing agroforestry systems to
mitigate the effects of climate change on food production.
The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) is
providing access to climate-smart technologies, training in sustainable
agricultural practices, and facilitating access to financial services
to help farmers adapt to changing environmental conditions.
Question. How are climate science and climate forecasting and
modeling being used to modify and keep assistance ahead of the curve in
terms of preparedness and adaptive capacities to the effects of climate
change?
Answer. Accurate predictions of future climate patterns and climate
extremes enable stakeholders to anticipate and mitigate potential
impacts, fostering the development of tailored adaptation strategies.
For instance, collaborations like AgMIP and HavosAI with the Vision for
Adapted Crops and Soils (VACS) movement integrated climate predictions
for 2050 and crop models to identify suitable areas for opportunity
crops in Africa. This is currently driving regionally tailored crop
diversification initiatives and guiding investments for food security
amid changing climates. This, and other, proactive approaches ensure
that assistance efforts are optimized and responsive to evolving
environmental conditions.
Question. How are you working with the private sector to improve
food security and assist in the development of climate management
strategies, aimed at improving developing countries' resilience?
Answer. The private sector is a critical actor in improving
developing countries' resilience through the Vision for Adapted Crops
and Soils (VACS) movement. The VACS Champions Program, a self-
certification initiative, recognizes private companies for undertaking
projects committed to developing climate-adapted nutritious crop
varieties and building, healthy fertile soils. The private sector also
participates in the VACS Community of Practice, a forum for entities
interested in VACS to discuss relevant issues and to identify
crosscutting innovative solutions. Additionally, Cargill and Archer
Daniels Midland (ADM), two of the largest agricultural companies in the
world, have made financial commitments to supporting the work of VACS.
The Department of State is also working to build the capacity of small
and medium sized enterprises that are providing climate resilient food
security solutions like modular cold chain storage in Africa through
the AU-endorsed Africa Adaptation Initiative Food Security Accelerator.
Question. How is the U.S. working with agriculture and food
production supply chains to reduce their greenhouse gas footprints?
Answer. USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS) is actively working
on this issue domestically. Internationally, we focus on addressing a
few key sources of emissions from agriculture and food production
supply chains. We are working with 14 of the largest agricultural
commodity trading companies to eliminate deforestation from their
supply chains, with a focus on the beef, soy, and palm oil sectors.
Agriculture continues to be the largest source of deforestation,
particularly in the tropics, and is responsible for around 2.5
gigatonnes of CO2, or slightly more than the annual
emissions of India. We're also working to tackle methane emissions from
rice and cattle, as well as nitrogen dioxide associated with overuse of
fertilizer. Internationally, through the Vision for Adapted Crops and
Soils (VACS) program, we are working with our partners to institute the
best practices for sequestering carbon on farms through our programming
in both providing adaptive seeds and improving soil health in Africa
and in planned activities in Central America.

Question. Please provide your assessment of how AI can and should
be deployed to better predict both:
Agricultural shortages, due to issues like water scarcity,
natural disasters, or quality of cropland AND
Global supply route disruptions and the cascading effect
of logistical and transportation disruptions to food supplies for
countries who heavily rely on imports?
Answer. In an era flooded with high-frequency and high-resolution
data from satellites, social media, and news outlets, AI has
revolutionized the synthesis of diverse data formats, enabling real-
time analysis of food system/security issues. Previously reliant on
costly and time-consuming on-the-ground data collection, the
development community now leverages AI to process vast amounts of data
swiftly. AI not only enhances analysis in well-covered areas but also
fills data gaps in regions where information was once scarce or
unavailable. By integrating remotely sensed climate data with
historical production data, AI can forecast localized agricultural
production levels and prices. These predictions are instrumental in
modeling global trade flows and anticipating potential disruptions in
supply chains. Furthermore, AI has been used to forecast climate events
and patterns, with a great degree of certainty, in areas where station
data is scarce. AI is one of the most powerful tools in our arsenal of
statistical analysis to identify and inform early warning systems of
food insecurity crises.
Question. What, if any, resources from Congress could assist your
respective department and agency to more rapidly integrate AI-supported
predictions into your analysis of the next food insecurity crisis?
Answer. Predictive analysis utilizing the latest technologies
derived from AI, could be an important tool in strategic planning for
the United States. We have just begun exploration of integrating new
technologies that combined with other data estimates will provide
better forecasting abilities to identify areas of food insecurity and
provide critical time for proactive strategic planning and
interventions. The Congress can assist the State Department by
supporting our requests for Vision for Adapted Crops and Soils (VACS)
funding in Administration's budget requests.
Question. The countries that will be able to unlock the full
potential of AI are likely not going to be the ones that are
experiencing food insecurity. Can you describe the work being done to
ensure that these countries are able to contribute to the development
and deployment of AI to combat food insecurity, or in the absence of
ongoing projects, how you would ensure their contribution?
Answer. We are currently addressing this challenge in several ways.
First, some of the funding recently provided to FAO to improve soil
information systems in Ghana and Kenya will support the development of
AI-supported systems that can be applied globally to determine crop
suitability and support land use planning at the field scale.
Second, separate funding is being used to support the development
of fertilizer decision support tools through USAID's ``Space-to-Place''
initiative. While these tools are country specific, they are being
developed in a way that will allow them to be made available to
countries with similar soils and climates.
Third, global predictions of the potential production of a wide
variety of crops under changing climates have been developed with input
from Havos.ai and the results of these analyses are available for all
countries in Africa.
In the future, AI-driven systems will provide even greater access
to crop- and field-specific information, supporting decisions including
where and what to plant, and how to sustainably manage the land.

Question. Given the risks and instability in the region, what
changes are being made by the World Food Program (WFP) and other
humanitarian organizations in order to address the famine in Yemen?
Answer. While there is a high level of food insecurity in Yemen, at
present, food security experts do not assess that famine is ongoing.
Humanitarian organizations working in Yemen have not had to
substantially change their postures or ways of working in Yemen as a
result of insecurity related to the Red Sea, to date. However,
organizations are engaging in contingency planning for alternative
transportation routes.
In northern Yemen, the World Food Program (WFP) continues to
negotiate an agreement with Houthi authorities to restart general food
assistance, which has been officially paused since December 5, 2023.
Ensuring food reaches the people who need it most is critical, and
these efforts are designed to help WFP prioritize the most food
insecure households for food assistance, allowing food assistance
dollars to be most impactful given ongoing humanitarian funding
constraints. The Administration is committed to assisting the people of
Yemen and will continue to support critical lifesaving activities and
services, such as the provision of essential nutrition, healthcare, and
water, sanitation, and hygiene assistance. USAID is increasing funding
to life-saving nutrition programs to mitigate any negative impact of
the pause in the north. USAID also continues to provide food,
nutrition, and other humanitarian assistance in southern Yemen.
Question. How have the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea impacted
global emergency food assistance?
Answer. As a result of Houthi maritime attacks, most major ocean
carriers have stopped transiting through the Red Sea and have opted to
pass around the southern tip of Africa. This rerouting adds about 20 to
25 days to the previously estimated arrival time and can increase costs
by 20 to 25 percent. As of March 6, 2024, USAID's Bureau for
Humanitarian Assistance (BHA) has diverted 9,070 metric tons (MT) of
Title II food commodities for South Sudan, Ethiopia, Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), and the Djibouti Prepositioning (PREPO)
Warehouse around the Cape of Good Hope. An additional 49,183 MTs of
food is scheduled for DRC, Somalia, Kenya, and Djibouti PREPO, which
will likely be diverted later in March.
Question. Which countries have been most effected by the disruption
in the delivery of humanitarian assistance?
Answer. The delivery of humanitarian assistance to Sudan, South
Sudan, Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Somalia, and
Kenya have been most affected by the Houthis' maritime attacks.
