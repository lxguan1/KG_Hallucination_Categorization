HEARING WITH TREASURY SECRETARY JANET YELLEN ---------- TUESDAY, APRIL 30, 2024 House of Representatives, Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC. The committee met, pursuant to call, at 10:05 a.m., in Room 1100, Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Jason T. Smith  presiding. Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Secretary Yellen, for appearing before this committee. I understand that it was 30 years ago this week that you were first nominated to a public sector role as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. It is a noteworthy record of service. I congratulate you, and I appreciate your willingness to answer our members' questions today.  You have joined the recent chorus of economists who acknowledged that it was a mistake to call inflation ``transitory.'' But it is worth noting the fundamental mistake of President Biden's reckless tax-and-spend policies that have sent the cost of living skyrocketing almost 20 percent since he took office. Families pay more today for pretty much everything than the day Joe Biden was sworn into office. Real wages are almost four percent lower than when he became President. The Federal Reserve has hiked borrowing rates to try to control inflation. Mortgage payments for the median-priced new home are now nearly $1,200 higher per month. Prices at the store are up. The cost of a gallon of gas is roughly 50 percent higher today than when President Biden took office. These are the facts. This is the reality that American families are living in President Biden's economy. Instead of allowing families hit by these high prices to keep more of their hard-earned money, President Biden wants the highest tax increase on families and small businesses in American history. Last week President Biden called for the Trump tax cuts to expire, promising, ``If I am reelected, it is going to stay expired.'' So President Biden's plan is for the average family of four, making $75,000, to pay an extra $1,500 to the IRS each year. President Biden's promise is that the Child Tax Credit will be slashed in half. President Biden's promise is that small businesses will face a 43.4 percent tax rate. This will all happen when the Trump tax cuts all expire under his watch. Basic facts. President Biden's promise is that family farms will be forced to sell off to big corporations to pay the death tax. In his latest budget President Biden continues breaking his promise to not raise taxes on families making less than $400,000. Under the President's plan seniors will see more of their life savings captured by the Federal Government. Small businesses will be taxed on their sweat equity and face tax rates approaching 50 percent. Energy producers will pay more, weakening America's energy independence. Madam Secretary, your own Department's data shows that millions of Americans earning less than $400,000 will end up paying a portion of your proposed business tax increases. That is on top of the new audits that will be coming from the IRS, which you conceded in this committee last year. Over 90 percent of those audits will fall on middle-class earners and small businesses. To add insult to injury, under one-party rule Democrats spent billions of taxpayer dollars on welfare for the wealthy and well connected. They gave the wealthy tax credits for leasing or buying luxury electric vehicles, while working families got higher prices from the so-called Inflation Reduction Act. Under that same law, the Biden Administration is sending billions of taxpayer dollars to Chinese companies tied to their communist government, all in the name of climate change. China is an adversarial nation, spreading its influence around the world at the expense of American workers and producers. America should be standing up to China's unfair practices, not using tax dollars to make us even more dependent on China. The record of the 2017 Trump tax cuts could not be more different than the policies of this Administration. The Congressional Budget Office found that after the law went into effect the share of taxes paid by the top one percent of households increased, while the burden falling on lower-income earners decreased. Real median household income increased by $5,000, a bigger gain than the prior eight years combined. The officially reported poverty rate dropped to its lowest level in U.S. history, and Black and Hispanic unemployment reached historic lows. We reversed the decades-long trend of American companies picking up and moving their jobs, factories, and money overseas. Beyond our borders the Biden Administration has adopted a posture of surrender and retreat. The OECD global tax deal the Administration is trying to negotiate would surrender America's tax revenue and jobs to foreign countries. Congress writes the laws, not bureaucrats negotiating behind closed doors. This deal has no path forward in this Congress. I hope today we can get some answers on why President Biden insists on tax hikes for working families, while the wealthy and well connected receive cash handouts for their Green New Deal spending. Thank you for appearing today, and I look forward to your testimony. I now recognize the Ranking Member Neal for his opening statement. Mr. NEAL. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Madam Secretary, we are honored to have you in our presence today. We also want to highlight what has been a remarkable career: chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers; chairman of the Federal Reserve Board; and a successor to Hamilton as Secretary of the Treasury. We are honored by your presence. Your team has been hard at work electrifying our nation, ushering in a new era at the IRS, and implementing Joe Biden's record-breaking economic agenda, all with the American people at the center of the work. Even the Wall Street Journal recently noted that our economy is the envy of the world. It is a well-deserved recognition for an administration that has created 15 million jobs, spurred a small business boom, and rebuilt an economy from the bottom up, the middle out, and breaking record after record. Four years ago, this success was unimaginable, and it certainly was never guaranteed. Millions were without a job at no fault of their own. The grocery shelves were bare, and we had no answers for the mysterious virus taking the country by storm. And then President Joe Biden took office, returning our nation to one of science, sensibility, and, for sure, stability. Starting with the American Rescue Plan and most recently with the Inflation Reduction Act, which came from this committee, Democrats' legislative successes have helped to transform the nation. We are bringing down healthcare and household energy costs. The clean energy economy has created over 270,000 jobs, and everywhere you travel you can tell that infrastructure projects are underway across the country. Thanks to our multi-year investment, the Internal Revenue Service has had another outstanding filing season. I am pleased with how, in such a short order, the agency has stood up to secure a way to file tax forms. I know many folks in the Commonwealth were able to use this program to ease their filing experience this year, including a state senator who mentioned it to me yesterday. And after years of underfunding at the hands of our Republican colleagues through their budget cuts, returns are being processed faster, and more Americans are getting the service they deserve. And already, $500 million in taxes owed from very wealthy people have been recovered. Looking ahead, the President's budget supercharges this progress and will finish the job for our people. The President's budget ensures that they have the supports necessary to not only fully participate in our workforce, but also to raise families and care for loved ones as we have witnessed wages going up, and the responsibility that we have to hold the well-connected accountable. Amid all of this success, our colleagues on the other side have had difficulties trying to use their gavels for the work of the American people. The amount of time that has been wasted in this Congress on chaos, conspiracies, impeachments--and we have been fielding questions about this expiration of their tax scam for next year. There are still over eight months left in this Congress and many more until these provisions expire. But it seems as though legislative opportunity is well already being considered by the Congress. I have seen their former leader calling for the devaluation of the dollar, stunting and even, in some cases, repealing much of our legislative progress in the name of politics. It is deeply unpopular, and it puts the health of our economy and countless paychecks on the line. While we expand what is possible and build the economy of the future, our colleagues plot the next round of trickle-down economics with another round of tax cuts for the wealthy. I didn't ever believe that advisers to the former President would be suggesting that we manipulate our currency, or we subtract from the independence of the Federal Reserve Board that is now--has a chairman who is a Republican. This is unheard of, that these sorts of--our economy would be jousted with in the coming months. I have said it before and let me say it once more: The majority is a threat to the health and economic security of our American people. Time to get past the chaos. Time to get past the conspiracies and get on with our work. We look forward to hearing you as you set the record straight, and pleased that you are joining us again. Let me yield back the balance of my time. Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Ranking Member Neal. Today's sole witness is United States Secretary of the Treasury, Ms. Janet Yellen. The committee has received your written testimony, and it will be made part of the formal hearing record. Secretary Yellen, you may begin when you are ready. STATEMENT OF JANET L. YELLEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY Secretary YELLEN. Thank you, Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Neal, and members of the committee. Thank you for the invitation to testify. The Biden Administration has driven an historic economic recovery over the past three years. GDP growth has been strong, growing three percent over the past four quarters. Inflation has decreased significantly since its peak, though we have more work to do. The labor market is also remarkably healthy, with the unemployment rate below 4 percent, for the longest stretch in over 50 years. Real wages and household median wealth have increased since before the pandemic, and families are putting their additional income and accumulated savings back into the economy. Consumer sentiment is up 21 percent from 1 year ago. President Biden and I are taking additional actions to bring down the costs of key household expenses like energy, prescription drugs, and housing. We are also focused on expanding our economy's capacity to create good jobs while reducing the deficit. As we implement the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, we are creating economic opportunity for Americans across the country, including those without college degrees and in communities that had historically been overlooked or left behind. Companies have announced over $675 billion in clean energy and manufacturing investments since the start of this Administration, some of which I have gotten the opportunity to see firsthand. The modernization of the Internal Revenue Service, made possible by the IRA and discretionary appropriations, has enabled us to combat tax evasion by the wealthiest Americans that costs our country over $150 billion a year. And it has made it easier for taxpayers to file their taxes and get the credits they are owed. We met or exceeded all the goals we set out for this filing season, including reaching an 88 percent level of service, saving taxpayers over 1.4 million hours of hold time, and providing an additional 11,000 hours of in-person assistance compared to last year. We also successfully launched the Direct File Pilot Program, an easy, free, and secure way to file taxes on a computer or mobile device with over 140,000 accepted returns in the first year. The President's budget proposes additional investments to lower costs for workers and families, and strengthen our economy while reducing the deficit, including making permanent the expansion of tax credits for health insurance premiums enacted in the American Rescue Plan and extended in the IRA, and expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, and Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. These proposals would help make health care more affordable, reduce child poverty, and give working families more breathing room in their household budgets. We can make these investments while reducing the deficit by $3 trillion over a decade through a combination of smart savings and tax proposals. President Biden and I have proposed implementing a billionaire minimum tax so that the top 100th of a percent pay their fair share, raising the tax on corporate stock buybacks to encourage businesses to reinvest profits in their workers and grow their companies, and closing estate and gift tax loopholes that allow wealthy Americans to pay less than they would otherwise owe. As a whole, the President's budget will enable us to address costs that families face right now and to bolster our country's economic strength for the years ahead.   Secretary YELLEN. I will now be happy to take your questions. Chairman SMITH. Thank you. We will now proceed to the question-and-answer session. Madam Secretary, in all four of President Biden's budgets he plans to hit middle-class families with a multi-trillion- dollar tax increase, starting in 2026. He has promised to let the Trump tax cuts expire. Isn't it true that President Biden is promising a $1,500 tax hike on a family of four earning less than 75,000 by that action? Secretary YELLEN. The President has been very clear that no family earning less than $400,000 will face a tax hike. He has not proposed such a thing since he took office, and he is not proposing to allow that to happen when parts of TCJA expire. Chairman SMITH. So---- Secretary YELLEN. He---- Chairman SMITH. When you testified at the Finance Committee last month, you said, ``The President does not have a plan to address the coming tax hikes.'' That was at the Senate Finance Committee last month. Isn't it true that, without a plan, the President would slash the Child Tax Credit in half, which means parents lose $1,000 from their pocketbooks for each child each year? Secretary YELLEN. The President has principles that will guide his negotiations with Congress over how to handle this, and his principles--he has made clear that he opposes increasing taxes on people earning less than 400,000. He supports cutting taxes for working people and families with children---- Chairman SMITH. So does that---- Secretary YELLEN . To give them more breathing room---- Chairman SMITH. Madam Secretary, does that mean that he will support the Child Tax Credit to be made permanent at $2,000 that was put in the Trump tax cuts? Would the President support that? Because that affects working families. Secretary YELLEN. The President has proposed in his most recent budget expanding the Child Tax Credit, and has supported the Wyden-Smith legislation that would increase the Child Tax Credit now, as well. Chairman SMITH. Would you say that it would be true that leaving the Trump tax cuts expired means President Biden would roll back Republicans' guaranteed deduction, resulting in a tax increase of $3,373 for a family earning less than $75,000? Secretary YELLEN. What I said, what the President has clearly articulated, is that no family earning under $400,000 will see their taxes go up in any set of proposals that the President is willing---- Chairman SMITH. So I appreciate that. We have looked at every budget that has been presented, and you have called for the expiration of the 2017 tax cuts, but there is no plan, as you testified before the Senate Finance Committee, saying that the President has a plan with regards to how to make sure there is no tax increases less than $400,000. I would love and welcome, and I think the American people would welcome, a plan from the President. In fact, he loves to interject in all kinds of policies. I would think he would want to, there. In testimony before the committee, former Senator Phil Gramm called the Biden Administration's decision to cut out Congress and unilaterally negotiate a tax deal with bureaucrats in Europe, ``The greatest abuse of the Constitution of the United States,'' was Senator Phil Gramm's comment when he testified here. Each of the Biden Administration's failures at the OECD can be traced to its decision to act unilaterally and without Congress. Will you commit to reject any OECD profit reallocation plan that disproportionately impacts American companies or allow U.S. tax revenues to be stolen away by foreign governments? Secretary YELLEN. Well, let me say that the Administration, the Biden Administration, has worked very closely with Congress to inform and get input on Congress's priorities to guide these negotiations over the last three-and-a-half years, and will continue to do that. And I strongly believe that the Pillar Two agreement that has been reached is very much in support of goals that are good for this country. The United States has been the only country, until this agreement was signed, to impose a tax on the overseas profits of its multi-nationals. And with this agreement secured is that all countries now will tax the profits of their multi-lateral-- multi-national companies, which creates a level playing field for American companies and will stop the race to the bottom. And the United States will benefit by adopting the minimum tax that is consistent with---- Chairman SMITH. So Secretary Yellen---- Secretary YELLEN . The Pillar Two agreement. Chairman SMITH . The communication from the very first time we ever had a conversation, I raised the issue, for example, of the research and development tax credit not being accounted for during OECD, but direct government subsidies of the Chinese Communist Party get much more credit than our research and development tax credit. You have said that you have worked with Congress. We have been raising that from day one. We have been providing how detrimental that would be to U.S. companies by empowering the Chinese, which you have visited that country several times in your tenure, which has empowered them, but you have done nothing with regards to that. Secretary YELLEN. I am sorry, but we have. Chairman SMITH. What have you done? Secretary YELLEN. We are negotiating with other countries right now to try to get favorable treatment for the R&D tax credit, and I am hopeful that these negotiations will be successful. And I would point out that other tax credits, including the green tax credits and credits affecting the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit have been codified as continuing under Pillar Two. Chairman SMITH. So I will just reiterate again, our concern is with almost $200 billion leaving American companies and going to foreign nations under the plan that this Administration negotiated with Europeans, and we are adamantly opposed to that. The Democrats' so-called Inflation Reduction Act that was supposed to prevent electric vehicle tax credits from going to foreign entities of concern in China and adversarial nations. But Treasury has created multiple loopholes that will send American taxpayer dollars to Chinese billionaires and Chinese manufacturers. Isn't it true that the foreign entity of concern rules written by your Treasury Department are more China- favorable than the same foreign entity of concern standards from Biden's Commerce Department for semiconductors? Secretary YELLEN. I believe that they are similar. These are very strong restrictions that, beginning this year and then continuing next year, preclude companies from receiving the $7,500 credit if this year they contain battery components that are--have originated in a foreign entity of concern. And next year it will affect critical minerals and processing. We have worked very closely with the Department of Energy and the Department of Commerce, other--it has been an interagency work to formulate these FIAC rules in a way that will certainly restrict China from profiting from the tax credit. Chairman SMITH. I think it is pretty clear that Treasury's version of these rules would allow Chinese billionaires to receive hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars, as confirmed by the non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation. So in response, this committee recently passed the End Chinese Dominance of Electric Vehicles in America Act, led by Congresswoman Carol Miller, which would close those egregious loopholes and protect the American taxpayer. Treasury must do a better job of pushing back against our foreign adversaries. I now recognize the ranking member for questions. Mr. NEAL. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Great job on China. You were firm. You were very strong, very assertive. IRA has worked. How about the harmonization of international tax rates so people don't seek the lowest tax jurisdiction, even though that is not where profits have been earned? Good work on the CHIPS Act. Really good work on the infrastructure bill. Certainly, the American Rescue package. This is a great story for us to tell. So I want to give you some time to talk, Madam Secretary. Implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act is really important. Let me give you a couple of minutes to talk about that. Secretary YELLEN. Well, let me just start by saying that although there is still more work to do, we have made tremendous progress implementing it. We have completed more than 60 guidance projects, and these are all on critical and complex issues. And we have been focused on getting the issues right. This involves collaboration with the Department of Energy, with EPA, and other experts to make sure that we are implementing the law effectively and as intended. It is also tremendously important, the impact that the IRA clean energy credits are having. We can see that they are catalyzing hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in cutting-edge, clean energy technology and strengthening our supply chains. and at the same time lowering emissions in line with our climate goals and creating good jobs across the country, and particularly in parts of the country that really have not seen a lot of burst of economic activity. Treasury has been doing research on the impact of the Act, and what we find is that investment is especially strong in communities that have not seen a lot of investment, that have lower income and a smaller fraction of college-educated workers. So this is making a huge difference. The response has been enormous, and I have had the privilege of seeing many of the projects that are being spurred, as well as training that is taking place. I have had the privilege of visiting many workforce training programs that have been started to give our workers the skills to fill the good, high-wage jobs that are being created by this IRA. Mr. NEAL. Thanks. And could you speak to labor participation rates? Secretary YELLEN. Yes. Labor force participation rates actually have moved up substantially for adult workers, male and female. They have now exceeded the--where they were pre- pandemic. They are moved up a great deal and overall have moved up, as well. And there is a downward trend that we see in labor force participation due to demographics, but this is really offsetting that. And this means not only more people working-- and also in response to higher real or inflation adjusted wages. It also alleviates supply constraints, and it is one of the factors that has enabled our economy to grow last year, for example, at 3 percent and to create more than 200,000 jobs a month on a consistent basis. Mr. NEAL. Nine million jobs every day in America go unanswered, as we know. And that is part of the skills alignment that you have just spoken to. A better job for all of us has required perhaps community colleges. But just as I close out--and I thank you for your testimony--I also want to point out something else. Everybody on this committee during my time objected to Chinese efforts to manipulate currency. So hearing now that the former administration is talking about the idea that they might manipulate currency, they might threaten the independence of the Federal Reserve Board, I never thought the day would come when it would be Democrats standing up for the independence of the Federal Reserve Board before our Republican colleagues. And consistently, both parties stood up against Chinese currency manipulation, and you were a very remarkable part of that. So we thank you for your testimony; delighted you are here. Secretary YELLEN. Thank you so much. Chairman SMITH. Thank you. I now recognize the vice chairman of the committee, Mr. Buchanan. Mr. BUCHANAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Madam Secretary, for being here. We appreciate your service. A lot of us have had an opportunity to work with you over the years. I want to touch on two things and have a little bit of a conversation. IMF came out a couple of days ago with a report. They are very concerned about where we are at financially. My background before I got here, 30 years in business, a lot of entities, you know, basically hundreds and hundreds of balance sheets and income statements. I am very concerned, as well, because at some point, you know, 49 out of 50 governors have to balance the budget. You can't continue down this road. Now, they are concerned because our deficit this year went from 1.4 trillion last year to 1.7. Interest on the debt, as you know, is close to a trillion. I have been here long enough, not quite 20 years, but been here long enough to clearly know that in the last 20 years it is over $20 trillion in debt. And now there is a lot of finger-pointing going on, but we need to find a way to work together. It has got to be dealt with at some point. I know you have laid something out, but I have heard these stories--not so much from you, but others--about pretty pictures down the road. But I look around the room here, and I have 10 grandkids, and I look around the room, and there are a lot of kids in here under 30, and we are spending their money and we have got to get very real about it. If you are in the State of Florida, one thing they have to do is pass a balanced budget amendment. That is the only thing they have to do, but they have to do that. And by the way, 49 out of 50 governors have to do the same thing. So I guess I ask you, what is your feeling about the IMF and their report a couple of days ago, where they are very concerned about where we are at financially and where we are going? Secretary YELLEN. Well, I would say I am not terribly concerned about where we are, but I do have concern about where we are going unless we undertake some significant steps to reduce the budget deficit. And if you look at the President's 2025 budget, you will see that he has proposed $3 trillion in measures to reduce the deficit over the next decade. I think that is important, and---- Mr. BUCHANAN. Let me ask you, Madam Secretary---- Secretary YELLEN . What it does is it keeps the--a key metric of the burden of the debt, which is real net interest that we have to pay on the debt Mr. BUCHANAN. I am limited on my time, and I want to get to this other question. You have talked about nobody paying any taxes above 400. I was chairman of the Florida Chamber, 130,000 businesses in the Chamber, and I would say 95 percent were pass-through entities. You are talking about letting that sunset. So what that means, so you understand, if someone has got 200 or 300 employees, or 50 employees, you could very well be at 53 percent, 54 percent taxes all in, because the pass-through rate would go back to 39.6, there is a 3.2. And then, if you look at states--I hate to say it, California and New York and some of the other states--they are great states, but they have another 10, 15 percent tax on top of it. So pass-through entities could very well--and then you are looking to get rid of 199A--could very well be north of 50 percent. What are your thoughts on that? Secretary YELLEN. Well, the President is committed to ensuring that no family, including those with pass-through businesses, making under $400,000 would see their tax increase. But he does believe, for the sake of tax fairness, that it is appropriate---- Mr. BUCHANAN. Well, let me---- Secretary YELLEN . For wealthy individuals---- Mr. BUCHANAN. Let me just show you---- Secretary YELLEN . And corporations to pay more. Mr. BUCHANAN. I have been in the real world in terms of building businesses and everything else. You might have 60, 80, 90 employees. You make 600, but then you have got to give up half of it or a good portion of it. Just 400 is nothing if you are trying to build a business, small and large. I am not talking about large corporations, I am talking about small businesses. And it will be a huge burden on these entities, you know, from that standpoint. So I am just telling you, if I look across Florida, a lot of these small and medium-sized businesses, yes, they do make 600, but they don't take home 600. They take home 100, 150, 200. They leave the capital in there to grow and build their business. That is the reality about where that is at. What are your thoughts? Secretary YELLEN. Well, as I said, I think the President feels it is important to tax those who are earning very high incomes at higher rates. Mr. BUCHANAN. One big thing is 199A. Where are you at on that, in terms of whether you are going to let that sunset, 199As, a 20 percent for a pass-through entity? Secretary YELLEN. I am not sure, I need to get back to you on that. Mr. BUCHANAN. Yes. Well, let me know, because that is very critically important. We went from corporate rates, 35 to 21, but you can't have pass-through rates at 40 percent. It makes no sense because everybody is going to move to a C Corp. Mr. BUCHANAN. With that I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Mr. Doggett is recognized. Mr. DOGGETT. Thank you so much for your testimony today about a budget that demonstrates that we can put our country on sound financial footing, reduce our deficit, and make some new investments so long as we demand that the well-connected and large corporations pay their fair share, and that we begin to close some of the loopholes in a tax code that is so full of holes it looks like Swiss cheese. In contrast, what the chairman has been urging the Biden Administration to do is to embrace an extension of all of the very inequitable Trump tax breaks that I have seen estimates would cost $3.5 trillion in additional debt. At the same time that they express all this concern about the debt, they seem to be about building more of that debt. And I appreciate the fact that the President and you certainly understand the ramifications of that. They also spend a lot of time defending corporations that like to hide their profits on American sales in foreign tax havens. And I appreciate the leadership that you have shown the world at OECD and elsewhere to stop this race to the bottom. Why is it important that the United States implement fully the agreement that the European countries are already implementing to stop this global race to the bottom in corporate taxation? Secretary YELLEN. Well, thank you. I believe that this race to the bottom in corporate tax rates took place over decades around the world, one jurisdiction competing with others to attract investment, and the only beneficiaries from that were really the companies themselves. Workers in all the countries where this was taking place ended up bearing more of the tax burden, and countries found it increasingly difficult to tax corporations to raise the funding that we need to support middle-class families and to invest in our country. And so stopping the race to the bottom means multi- nationals based in every country around the world will all face the same minimum tax. Some countries will charge more than the minimum tax. We have proposed and believe that the United States can--given the environment for business in our country, we can afford to do that, and we have proposed a minimum rate of 21 percent. Also, that would be in line with our proposal for the corporate alternative minimum tax. Mr. DOGGETT. As you know, some of the Republicans that really don't believe in taxing corporations at all have said, well, if you go above 15 percent, which they don't support either, and you go to a higher level, that this will reduce American competitiveness. How is it that our corporations, our multi-nationals would remain competitive if they pay a rate on their foreign profits that is higher than 15 percent? Secretary YELLEN. Well, competitiveness really has to do with differentials in incentives across countries. And prior to Pillar Two the United States was the only country that taxed the overseas earnings of its multi-nationals. We have the GILTI tax. It is a lower tax rate, and it is not country by country, but our companies did just fine with that. The rest of the world had nothing. Now the rest of the world will go to a country-by-country 15 percent minimum, which would leave the United States with the lowest rate. And we can--even if we go up to 21 percent, the differential is substantially smaller than it was before. Mr. DOGGETT. Thank you. I have also heard increasing concern that we place our cleaner domestic production on a more even playing field, the fact that we are importing steel and aluminum and some other products that are made in a very dirty environment abroad. What do you think should be done about trying to see that American companies are competitive, are not being subject to anti-competitive practices with this dirty production? Secretary YELLEN. Well, President Biden proposed, I believe last week or the week before, to actually raise taxes on-- tariffs on Chinese steel. Our firms are cleaner and China, in steel, suffers from tremendous overcapacity, which leads it to really sell it on fairly low prices globally. And I think it is appropriate to do that. Mr. DOGGETT. Thank you for your leadership. Secretary YELLEN. Thank you. Chairman SMITH. Mr. Kelly is recognized. Mr. KELLY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Secretary, thank you for being here again and for spending so much of your life in working in this body to try and make policy that actually makes sense. That is why I still keep trying to figure out Pillar One and Pillar Two, the possible loss for us of almost $200 billion. What is the offset for that? So how do we replace that lost revenue? How does that work into the whole idea of this? Secretary YELLEN. Well, that revenue estimate--you are referring to JCT, I believe, and that is an extreme negative case in--they indicated in their analysis that the outcome overall is uncertain. And in the most likely cases the outcome in terms of tax collections would be positive, not negative. Mr. KELLY. Now, I know that is all debatable, and I keep wondering why in the world the United States is so hell bent on giving up market to foreign countries and saying that this isn't the best interest globally of what we want to do. I am more interested in a very strong United States that remains the strongest country on the face of the Earth, that we don't have to depend on anybody else. Now, I understand that the U.S. is going to be presented an agreement on Pillar One to sign in the next two months. So does Treasury commit to work with Congress before signing the OECD Pillar One agreement? Secretary YELLEN. We have been in touch with Congress throughout this process. One of the things we heard from Congress on Pillar One is that there needed to be an opportunity for public comment. We heard that certainty around what is called Amount B that has to do with transfer pricing is very important to Members of Congress, and it is something where we need to make sure we get firm commitments from other countries. We also heard from Congress that getting a very clear definition of digital service taxes, what they are and what is ruled out, all this is very important and we agree. And those are our red lines, and it is what we are negotiating for in the final months of negotiations on Pillar One. Mr. KELLY. And I agree with you on everything you have said, that on its best day this can be--this whole scenario, what we are going through--can be considered unbelievably complicated, and how at the end of the day it is in the best interest of the United States. I have always thought that, you know, we seem to be getting into a push and pull on what constitutional authority lies with which body, and the idea that somehow Congress will be the afterthought in a process that absolutely it is supposed to control. So I am really interested, as you go forward on this, the sharing of that, all that information--I just don't understand the negotiations and the constitutional authority. And I know you can do certain things, and there are other things that you have to run through the Congress. My concern is that the Congress seems to be an afterthought now, and not the main consideration when we do these negotiations. And it is like, well, this is what you gave us some authority to do, so we are going to go ahead and do it. I just don't understand at all how we sell this to the people we represent, that somehow this is in the best interest of the United States. I still want to dwell on the fact that we have been losing market share because of policies that we have initiated. Not so much that we have strong foreign competition, it is that we have weak policy when it comes to maintaining our own market share. And for whatever reason, we seem to have become a global entity as opposed to the strongest country the world has ever known and a nation that is the first responder in everything that goes bad in the world. We are the first ones to be there, and we keep ceding off all of these different things that we have, all of these different abilities that we have. And so, no, I think it is more important to act globally right now. I would just suggest that I am looking at the globe right now, and the globe is looking at us to see--I wonder when the Yanks are going to show up. I just hate to see us keep giving up authority, and the negotiations taking place from the executive branch, and then being run through the Congress at a later date. So all I am asking you to do is commit. We need to know what is going on and what is taking place. I don't like giving anybody a pen to go ahead and sign on to something in an international trade and a global tax initiative. It just doesn't make sense to me. And I think it is totally unconstitutional. And in fact, it is just not the right way to do things. Secretary YELLEN. We have consulted with Congress throughout over the last three-and-a-half years. Mr. KELLY. Yes, yes. Well, I appreciate what you are saying. Secretary YELLEN. And any agreement would need to be---- Mr. KELLY. Yes, yes, it depends---- Secretary YELLEN . Legislated and---- Mr. KELLY. Ms. Yellen, excuse me, just to reclaim my--my time is up, but it depends on how you identify ``We have consulted with Congress.'' I like to be consulted before something happens, not after, where it just happened and--you guys are willing to sign on. Listen, thank you for your service to the country. I think it has been incredible. And thank you for being with us today. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Thank you. Mr. Thompson. Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Secretary Yellen, for being here today. But more important, for your tremendous leadership and your steady handedness in your position not only now, but over the years. I would like to start by noting a couple of data points, a few data points: 15 million jobs have been created under President Biden; more Americans have health insurance than ever before; Democrats expanded Child Tax Credit, cut child poverty by over 40 percent and benefitted over 35 million families; the IRS is holding wealthy tax cheats accountable, and has already recovered over $500 million in taxes owed; wages are outpacing inflation; and our economy is outperforming the rest of the advanced countries around the world. And Madam Secretary, you are in large part responsible for those successes, so thank you very much. I would like to start with a couple of things that you mentioned in your testimony. First is the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act. As you mentioned, there were a host of provisions in that bill designed to create jobs, boost renewable energy, and lower costs for consumers. Can you talk a little bit more about the implementation of the clean energy tax credits in that Act? And are those incentives working? And what sort of investment are you seeing in renewable energy, manufacturing jobs, et cetera? Secretary YELLEN. Thank you. First, thank you for your kind words. So we are working around the clock to write the regulations that will provide certainty to households and businesses around the credits. We are seeing the ERA clean energy credits catalyze investment in clean energy technologies. We are concerned about our supply chains, particularly being over-reliant on China for many aspects of our clean energy, whether it is solar panels or batteries. We want to make sure that we are strengthening our supply chain at the same time we are creating good jobs and lowering emissions. And we are seeing many good jobs, and the wage and apprentice requirements to receive that large bonus really ensure that the jobs that are being created are good jobs. We are seeing investments in many parts of the country, especially places that are in need, whether they are areas of the country that were dependent on fossil fuels and have seen coal mines or plants close, areas that just haven't benefitted from very much investment. We are especially seeing good results there. And we are making sure that people know who can benefit from this law. It has unique features that non-profits and state and local governments can actually benefit from this law through the direct pay feature. We are working hard to make sure that potential beneficiaries understand how this can positively affect them. Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you very much. I would also like to ask about 2025 and the upcoming expiration of the 2017 Republican tax bill. I appreciate the President reiterating that no one making under $400,000 a year will see a tax increase. One of the things that has been left out by my friends on the other side of the aisle in talking about this is that it wasn't paid for, their bill was not paid for. And that, by definition, is inflationary. So in your view, what are some of the more responsible ways that we might offset the costs of any of the TCJA extensions? Secretary YELLEN. Well, the President has proposed a very large number of raisers in his budget, and all of them could be used for this purpose. He is proposed raising the stock buyback tax; raising the corporate alternative minimum tax; enacting Pillar Two, which would bring in substantial revenues; raising--we would raise--proposed to raise the corporate income tax to 28 percent--still a cut relative to pre-TCJA, but substantial revenues; a billionaires tax that would ask those extremely high-income individuals, wealthy individuals to pay something more in line with what nurses and firefighters pay in their taxes. And there are a wealth of ideas there on how we can finance this. Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you, Madam Secretary. I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Mr. Schweikert. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Secretary, first in this discussion, conversation, my basic principle is at the scale we must borrow at we want stability. We want liquidity. You know, we don't need any hiccups out there. And if some of this is a little off, you can pass me off to staff. But first I want to touch on cash balances. And part of this is there are a couple of reports out there that basically say statutory mechanics, when the current authority for borrowing starts to run out we should be doing an operating cash balance of around $23 billion. That seems dramatically too low. You know, in previous years you would run--the Treasury would in 2023--a $600 billion cash balance. Secretary YELLEN. That is right. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Today you are running over 900 billion. This is actually more of a mechanical, technical question. Do you need us, as the Ways and Means Committee, to update any statutory authorities or mechanics of what type of operating balance do you need to maximize stability? You know, you saw the blip we had yesterday when you did your, you know, refunding announcements, and that was only, what, a $41 billion tick up for that quarter. What do we do to maximize interest rate efficiency? Do you need any additional authorities? Secretary YELLEN. I don't think we need legislation. We have standing policy on operating cash balances. And I believe around 500 billion would be a normal level, given the volume. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Well, but you have been running dramatically higher than that traditional 500, 600 billion. Secretary YELLEN. Well---- Mr. SCHWEIKERT. You know, I think in the previous quarter you were running in the mid-800s; now you are running over 900. Secretary YELLEN. I think it depends on what our flow of expenses are. It can vary over time. And, of course, it has ups and downs as we--you know, tax collections are bunched around April 15th. But what caused our cash balances to run to exceptionally low levels in the past was the failure of Congress to raise the debt limit. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Well, but where I was going with that is there is an analysis that the statutory authority actually requires you to go down to 23 billion, and that may be one of your legal team saying, okay, you have the authority to ignore that interpretation of the statute. So, look, this is not a gotcha question. I want to know what we can do to help maximize stability. Secretary YELLEN. I would be glad to get back to you with details on that. But I would say during my time the major threat I have seen to our cash balance is that when Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling---- Mr. SCHWEIKERT. The trigger dates. Secretary YELLEN . In a timely way, we have absolutely no alternative but to run down our cash balances. Otherwise, we would be unable to pay our bills. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Yes, understood. I have a whole chart on your extraordinary measures and what is in your balances. I was just sitting here playing, and I have smart, much smarter, people on staff--like your billionaire tax. Okay. Great politics. Do I read it properly in your testimony, it is a .01 percent? Okay, fine. But that works out to, over the next 10 years, on an average of 0.143 percent of GDP. This year our burn rate is close to 9, 9.6 percent of GDP. My fear is the politics of theatrics and the actual math. We do a crappy job telling each other the truth and telling the public the truth of the fiscal--because you gave some brilliant speeches when you were Federal Reserve chairwoman on this type of debt future. And we are hitting numbers that we weren't supposed to hit for 10 years. When we did a quick analysis of some of the President's tax proposals, we were coming up--when we did the economic effects--of about a point and a half, 0.6 percent of GDP. Okay. But if we are burning over nine percent of GDP in borrowing, and this is in the time this year where tax receipts are up, what, seven percent? Secretary YELLEN. I am not sure just how much they are---- Mr. SCHWEIKERT. My fear is, as a committee, we are not telling each other the truth of the scale of the borrowing stress. We are basically, the United States and China, we are consuming much of the world's available capital. I really wish we could have a more adult conversation of the scale of---- Secretary YELLEN. I---- Mr. SCHWEIKERT. This is almost hitting dystopian levels of numbers. And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Mr. Larson. Mr. LARSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Madam Secretary, welcome to the committee. I want to associate myself with the remarks of Mr. Neal in saluting, I think, what every member on this committee knows: Your remarkable and incredible tenure of service to this great nation of ours, we are blessed to have you with us today. We are also blessed to have with us today another great woman who is in the audience with us today, Elsie Pascrell. And I think every member of the committee would join with me in recognizing that she gets a direct shot to heaven.  Mr. LARSON. Elsie, welcome here to the committee. Madam Secretary, I want to commend the Biden Administration. I think Mr. Thompson went through the list of accomplishments, et cetera, but I especially want to focus on what you have repeatedly said, that the President--and he has been rock solid on this--has said that he is not going to raise taxes on anybody who is making under 400,000. And he has also been out there as a champion of both not only protecting but preserving Social Security. And again--and let's do the reality check here by saying that people making over $400,000 ought to be paying what people making 35, 50, 75, 100,000 are paying. And currently, because I think this comes as a surprise to most Americans, most earning above that level pay little or nothing. Millionaires end up finishing contributing to Social Security in February, but zillionaires and wealthy people pay little at all or they circumvent the tax code all together and don't pay into the nation's number one anti-poverty program for the elderly and the number-one anti- poverty program for children. I commend President Biden for not only saying that we want to protect Social Security, but we want to expand its benefits, and we can do so by having all Americans pay their fair share. He couldn't have been clearer in his State of the Union message that this is what it is about. Of course, as you know, Madam Secretary, it is Congress that has to make these moves, and Congress hasn't done anything to enhance Social Security in more than 50 years. And talk about numbers, with 10,000 Baby Boomers a day becoming eligible for Social Security, it is long overdue that Congress take action. I applaud the President for doing so in such a straightforward, dramatic way, and paying for it. So my brief question to you, Madam Secretary, could you discuss the importance of Social Security and why the President has adhered to making sure that we are not taxing people below 400,000? Secretary YELLEN. I would be happy to. Every year Social Security lifts tens of millions of seniors out of poverty. It is the Federal Government's most important anti-poverty program, and it is a guarantee that generations of Americans have counted on. Namely, after working hard throughout one's life, that you will be able to retire with security and with dignity. And for those reasons, President Biden feels very strongly that we need to preserve the benefits and even extend the benefits of Social Security and honor the commitments that we have made to the nation's seniors. He has committed to working with Congress to protect Social Security for this generation and future generations. Mr. LARSON. I thank you, Madam Secretary. And I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Dr. Wenstrup. Dr. WENSTRUP. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for being with us today, Secretary Yellen. I appreciate it. Much of our conversation today has been focused on the future of our nation's tax code, of course, as we approach the expiration of many key policies from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act next year. You know, when I think about tax policy, I think about making America the best place in the world to do business and, for that matter, the best place to work. And right now we are in a fierce global, economic, political, and strategic competition. It is not the same as after World War II. Our adversaries, like China, want to dominate the world markets, and they are doing that. And they want to make America and our allies dependent on key industries and supply chains. I know you know that. Keeping our tax code globally competitive is a crucial part of strengthening our domestic manufacturing base and reducing our dependance on unreliable supply chains or those that can be used as weapons, if so desired, by our adversaries. Secretary, I know you have spoken at length about the need for de-risking--I agree with you on that--when it comes to our economic relationship with China, and your desire to see more friendshoring of our critical supply chains. I also know you recently visited China--thank you for doing that--to discuss economic issues, including the massive subsidy-driven industrial overcapacity that China has built, which is distorting global markets. I am not sure that we can always change what they do and their practices, but we can and should see what we can do to counter that, and I am glad you focused on the risk of China and what they pose to our security. But I am concerned that the Administration's tax policy proposals would take us in exactly the wrong direction when it comes to our economic security and our national security, for that matter. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was a huge step towards making our tax code globally competitive, bringing more business investment back to the United States. Since it passed, we have seen zero corporate inversions, and instead we have seen American businesses bringing back their overseas earnings to fuel investment and wage growth here in the states. So now, more than ever, we need to be working together to build on that type of progress, not reverse it by imposing crippling tax hikes on American families and businesses. I believe that is exactly what will happen if we do not act to renew key provisions of the 2017 tax reform law when they expire next year. Meanwhile, the negotiators from your department representing us at the OECD are preparing to give away the U.S. tax base and allow foreign countries to impose discriminatory taxes on U.S. companies. This does not help us. Anyone who runs a business would understand that. I believe that tax increases proposed by the President's budget and the failed global tax negotiations being supported by this Administration would severely harm our efforts to rebuild our domestic manufacturing and bring home critical supply chains. Secretary, the President's budget proposes increasing the corporate tax rate--it is one of the highest in the world, even higher than Communist China--which will make it much harder to bring manufacturing home from China and to meet your desire to de-risk from the PRC. One example: The Chinese have a monopoly on generic medications, all the way down to the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients. How do we break that monopoly and reduce our health risk, our national security risk by increasing corporate tax rates, making us unable to compete? I mean, are you against or are you for domestic supply chain production to enhance our national security and our national health security for our critical needs? Because I just don't see how increasing corporate tax rate, making us less competitive in the world is going to bring business back to the United States, where we need it most. Secretary YELLEN. I certainly agree with the goal of having resilient supply chains. The idea of friendshoring means we will work with trusted allies. And in addition to sourcing domestically, in the case of critical drugs, certainly I think that is an area where it is important that we have domestic capacity and are not totally reliant on China and other countries that may not prove dependable in the future. Dr. WENSTRUP. But---- Secretary YELLEN. And there are a variety of ways to promote this. Dr. WENSTRUP. Excuse me, though, who are we going to depend on, then? If we are increasing our corporate tax rate, that doesn't make us more competitive. And are we going to rely on our allies to reduce theirs? Is that the idea? I mean, this just makes no sense. Secretary YELLEN. Well, we---- Dr. WENSTRUP. We have had no one leave. Secretary YELLEN. I would point out that the Pillar Two agreement does impose taxes on China, that regardless of what their subsidies are or how they choose to tax, the United States and other countries that adopt Pillar Two will have the ability to place taxes up to this minimum tax on China to try to level the playing field. So China will not gain any advantage if it chooses--it has said it will implement the deal. Dr. WENSTRUP. I doubt that---- Secretary YELLEN. But if it doesn't do so, we will implement the deal on Chinese multi-nationals that compete with ours through a provision called the Undertaxed Payment Rule. Dr. WENSTRUP. Well, you had conversations with them. I would doubt that they said that they would cut their subsidies. I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Mr. Pascrell. Mr. PASCRELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome, Madam Secretary. So unemployment is at an historic low. Interrupt me when I say something that is not correct or can't be proven by data. Wages are rising. I want to come back to that in a minute. Inflation has plummeted. We got work to do. Factories are booming. America's economy is the envy of the entire world. There is no two ways about it. So I am proud of our efforts to make big business and rich tax cheats finally pay their fair share. What the heck is wrong with that? And we have made progress. We have not made progress in the area of the income gap that still exists, even when wages increased four to five percent. We have got to do something about the code, the tax code, the very tax code. You can draw a straight line from these winds to the policies enacted by President Biden and, yes, Democrats. Secretary Yellen, I am glad the budget includes finally closing the carried interest loophole, maybe the worst loophole in the entire tax code. My Ending Wall Street Tax Giveaway Act mirrors your proposal to ensure Wall Street executives and private equity tycoons pay their fair share. We came very close to closing that loophole, if you remember, in the Inflation Reduction Act. And I am not giving up because if we don't do that we continue to send the wrong message to the taxpayers. Now, you talk about competition, that is what we need. Madam Secretary, as the Congress continues to consider future tax legislation, can you commit to making carried interest fairness a top priority? Secretary YELLEN. Yes. Mr. PASCRELL. Question two. Early this year the GAO released a report. I requested that report on ways to crack down on wealthy tax cheats. It found that good enforcement returns $12 for every dollar spent. You remember that report? But identifying high-dollar cheating is a big challenge. They got every trick and every lawyer in the trade as rich tax cheats use sophisticated and brazen tactics to obscure their earnings. That is nothing new over the last 45 years. Madam Secretary, can you expand on plans to address gaps in the IRS hiring, training, and tech so that the agency has the tools to close the tax gap? Secretary YELLEN. The IRS is doing exactly that using the funding provided in the Inflation Reduction Act. Its budget was so limited after decades of cutting its budget as the economy grew that enforcement and the ability to hire competent tax lawyers, accountants, data scientists, and the like, that audit rates fell to exceptionally low levels on wealthy individuals, complex partnerships, and large corporations. And with the infusion of funds that the IRS has received in addition to, and importantly, improving consumer service dramatically, it is going after all of those tax cheats who are responsible for what is estimated as a $7 trillion tax gap over the next decade. And it has had an early success in going after 1,000 individuals making more than $1 million who owed back taxes. It has already collected $500 million. But there is much further to go, and that is where the enforcement dollars are going. No increase, as I have promised and as the commissioner has promised, on households or small businesses earning under $400,000. It is all going to the areas that you named. Mr. PASCRELL. Thank you, Madam Secretary. Welcome to the neighborhood. And I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Dr. Ferguson. Dr. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Secretary, thank you for being here. I want to see if you can help me understand some math, if you don't mind. With OECD proposals, Joint Tax said that Pillar Two is going to cost us $120 billion in tax revenue over a 10-year period. And OECD would--Pillar One would cost just $40 billion over 10 years. This is JCT. So you know, we have to use this. So you are looking at $160 billion, probably on the conservative side, of lost revenue coming into the Treasury because we are turning that revenue over to other countries. All right. If that is the case, and we are going to lose that revenue, that is one thing. But I can just point to two Georgia companies that will tell you that their analysis of Pillar One will cost them combined about $1 billion in sales. Now, if a company is going to lose $1 billion in sales, that means they are going to start cutting back, which means that it is going to put my fellow Georgians out of work. That doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. So again, according to JCT, between Pillars One and Two, about $160 billion in lost revenue. Now, just laying the groundwork there, you made mention that you were going to propose or work with the President and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to raise the corporate minimum tax, AMT, the corporate tax to 28 percent, implement a new billionaire tax. You had a laundry list of items, correct, that you believe we should be raising taxes on? Okay, so let me ask you something. If a company owes the Treasury $200 million in taxes, and you would like to collect those taxes to help with the deficit or spending, correct, but then they can turn around and write off all of that by buying green energy tax credits, how much of that money, then, of that $200 million is going to come into the Treasury? I mean, if I can wipe out my tax liability by buying green energy tax credits, what good does that do in coming into the Treasury? Secretary YELLEN. Well, if the firm is using the transferability feature to buy these tax credits, then another company that we want to benefit from those credits, the stimulus, and incentive that they offer but that lacks---- Dr. FERGUSON. But that---- Secretary YELLEN . Sufficient tax liability, this is a way in which we provide---- Dr. FERGUSON. But we are giving a pass to--I mean, analysis has shown that about 90 percent of these tax credits are going to go to companies with over $1 billion in revenue. And again, if you are looking to bring revenue into the Treasury to pay for whatever---- Secretary YELLEN. Look, it is really the same thing as essentially making the tax credits refundable, which would have been---- Dr. FERGUSON. How would we---- Secretary YELLEN . An alternative. That is a-- -- Dr. FERGUSON. Why would we do that? Why would we give---- Secretary YELLEN. Because---- Dr. FERGUSON . Companies like Amazon and Walmart, these major corporations---- Secretary YELLEN. Because---- Dr. FERGUSON . Refundable credits to go spend money in the green energy sector? Secretary YELLEN. Because many of the companies that are responding to the IRA and building the clean energy economy we want to see are companies that lack sufficient tax liability to be able to benefit from these---- Dr. FERGUSON. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Secretary YELLEN . Tax incentives. Dr. FERGUSON. Madam Secretary, reclaiming my time, if you are going to go down that road, and you are going to say companies lack that tax liability, why are we doing it on green energy and not looking at pharmaceuticals, not looking at other technology? But bottom line, why wouldn't we just say to Amazon, okay, not to pick on them, but they are a highly profitable company-- why not just say, ``You have got to pay your taxes, and then you go buy a fleet of battery-powered vans if you want to''? You are cutting revenues, you are giving a tax break to the very people that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are saying, they want them to pay their fair share. But they are not going to pay their fair share because they are going to go down this green energy deal---- Secretary YELLEN. And---- Dr. FERGUSON . That absolutely undermines our competitiveness. It doesn't make sense. The math doesn't add up. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Thank you. Mr. Davis. Mr. DAVIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome back, Madam Secretary. Thank you for your work. Let me begin by offering my sincere appreciation to your staff, who are helping my office with a number of very complex constituent issues. Your staff is top notch, and for that I am grateful. In addition, I thank Treasury for its effort to work collaboratively with states to identify the owners and beneficiaries of the $30 billion in unclaimed savings bonds. And I know that you cannot comment because the rule is not final, but I wanted to share concerns that Representative Estes and I and others on this committee have raised about the proposed rule. Given that most of these unclaimed bonds come from the middle of the last century, when African Americans and others were excluded from banks and often turned to Treasury bonds as a key investment, I suspect that a high percentage of unclaimed bond holders will be Blacks and people of other minority group identities. Given these concerns and given the success of state treasurers in helping people find unclaimed property, I worry that the proposed rules would greatly limit the ability of states to help Americans get back their missing savings bonds. My hope is that the final rule will allow Treasury to work more collaboratively with states, as we intended when we enacted the law. And finally, in my remaining time, I would like to thank you for your hard work implementing the increased energy investment credit for solar power, especially in low-income communities, and ask if you could share any updates to this program. Secretary YELLEN. Thank you very much. And on the savings bonds issue, I appreciate your comments and we will make sure that they are adequately considered before final regs are finalized. And on the bonuses for low-income communities, we have worked hard to clarify the rules and make sure that there is-- that low-income communities--that is a special focus of the IRA--to make sure that they are able to benefit, especially from the credits for solar, wind, and other renewable energies. We are working to finalize a set of regulations on this, and there are also allocated credits for low-income communities that the Department of Energy is--has accepted applications and awarded funds. Mr. DAVIS. I thank you very much. And let me just ask, are these proven to be effective in terms of job creation? Secretary YELLEN. I think overall are--the data that we have amassed shows that the green energy--the green credits have been very effective at stimulating investment resulting in job creation. And those jobs are disproportionately in lower- income communities with lower college graduation rates, also in rural communities and in communities that have been dependent on fossil fuel and seeing that--seeing job loss there. Mr. DAVIS. Thank you very much. And Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Chairman SMITH. Mr. Estes. Mr. ESTES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Secretary Yellen, for joining us today.  Mr. ESTES. As you know, last month the inflation came in hotter than expected for the third month in a row, which is a hit to American families by itself. But it is not just a one- time impact. Inflation is cumulative. And hardworking Kansans have been suffering for three years now, as this chart behind me indicates. You know, since Joe Biden took office inflation is up over 19 percent. The Joint Economic Committee estimates that Kansans are paying an average of nearly $1,000 more per month for the same goods and services, the same food, the same clothes, the same gas, the same rent that they did in January of 2021. And since then, in total, the average Kansan household has spent $23,600 more due to inflation. At the same time, net income is down almost four percent. I know your boss and his Administration like to point to rosier numbers, but the fact is for everyday Americans the chart behind me is the epitome of Bidenomics, and it is a complete failure. You know, several years ago, Secretary, you called inflation transitory. And since you have said that, I think that is the wrong word, but I guess I would like to ask you what you would call inflation now. What word would you use? Secretary YELLEN. Well, inflation has come down considerably, and the consensus of thinking among economists is that it was largely due to supply shocks that are mitigating. And our inflation has been quite similar to that in other advanced countries around the world, which suggests it was due to supply shocks connected with the pandemic. Mr. ESTES. I think you will have---- Secretary YELLEN. Inflation has come down---- Mr. ESTES. I think you will have a difference of opinion in economists. I mean, we even had Democrat and Republican economists in 2021 talking about the extra spending that was coming proposed by the Administration that was actually going to result in this inflation. And actually, that is what we have seen. Secretary YELLEN. Well---- Mr. ESTES. You know, I think most Americans would use phrases like ``crippling,'' or ``painful,'' or ``hindering their pursuit of the American dream.'' In fact, my constituents tell me about the challenges they face when they fill up their cars, or buy their groceries, or pay the rent or mortgage. And the numbers show the pain behind me that is still continuing to increase to this day as a result of Bidenomics and the policies that have been increased by the Democrats over the last three years. Secretary YELLEN. I think Americans care---- Mr. ESTES. I also want to switch gears a little bit before I run out of time. You mentioned earlier in a discussion with Chairman Smith that President Biden was not going to increase taxes on people making less than $400,000. In fact, I have a tweet here from Joe Biden dated one week ago today in talking about the Trump tax cuts. And he said, ``This tax cut is going to expire. If I am reelected, it is going to stay expired.'' I did some quick calculations. And basically, what that means is that there is going to be a 25 percent increase in the tax rate on people that make less than $44,000. There is going to be an additional $14,000 tax increase on people making less than $95,000, and additional increases on others up until making the $400,000. So if this tweet is right that came from President Biden, he is going to increase taxes on people making less than $400,000. Secretary YELLEN. President Biden has repeatedly issued a set of principles that will guide his negotiations, and he has repeatedly said that---- Mr. ESTES. I can send you the tweet. Secretary YELLEN . He will not support increases on families making under $400,000. And I haven't looked at the tweet myself, but---- Mr. ESTES. I am sorry, I really want to get to one other point---- Secretary YELLEN . That is not what he---- Mr. ESTES . I really want to get to one other point before we run out of time, but I can send you this tweet if you would like to see that later, after the committee. Secretary YELLEN. Well, I---- Mr. ESTES. But I do want to talk a little bit about OECD. I know it has been brought up before, particularly Pillar One and Pillar Two. I mean, I have stated several times in the hearing room that, in principle, Republicans and Democrats are in favor of eliminating the discriminatory digital services taxes and provide tax simplicity and consistency for businesses in the growing digital economy. However, despite the ongoing discussions, we are still seeing more and more countries like Canada enact DSTs, and the proliferation of Pillar One and Pillar Two has provided foreign countries the opportunity to raid our tax base. In fact, Pillar Two, as pointed out by the Joint Tax Committee on Taxation, is going to cost the U.S. Treasury tax revenue--Pillar Two itself, as pointed out by my colleague, Representative Ferguson--that it is $120 billion. And earlier this year JCT reported on Pillar One and noted that the plurality of in-scope countries would be from the U.S., and likely that the U.S. Treasury would forego between 100 million and $4.4 billion per year in tax receipts. In fact, I recently heard from one Fortune 100 company that they would be required to send between $100 and $500 million from the U.S. Treasury to countries like France and Germany and Japan. I think these policies that have been negotiated with OECD are dangerous for our U.S. tax base. We are already struggling to collect enough revenue, and I think we need to change course. I am sorry, I am out of time. I would like to talk more about this with you. But I will yield back, Chairman. Chairman SMITH. Thank you. Mr. Smucker. Mr. SMUCKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon, Secretary. I am over on this side. There we go. Fooled me, too. I would like to just clarify with you for those listeners watching this today the impact of your budget on the debt. Can you tell me the current level of our debt? What is the current debt amount?  Mr. SMUCKER. It is about 34 trillion---- Secretary YELLEN. Yes. Mr. SMUCKER . Which includes debt held by the-- intergovernmental debt, as well. Secretary YELLEN. That is right. Mr. SMUCKER. And can you also tell me what the projected debt will be at the end of this budget period, at the end of 10 years? Secretary YELLEN. So normally we look at debt held by the public, which---- Mr. SMUCKER. Okay, we can use that number if you would like. Secretary YELLEN . Which is currently about 28 trillion. Mr. SMUCKER. Right. Secretary YELLEN. And in 2034, under our budget, I believe it would be around 45 trillion. Mr. SMUCKER. Yes, the---- Secretary YELLEN. But GDP also grows, and the ratio to GDP would be a few percentage points more---- Mr. SMUCKER. Well, it would be---- Secretary YELLEN . Than it is now. Mr. SMUCKER. It would be at 128 percent, and now it is at 97. That is more than a few points. Secretary YELLEN. No, it would be at 105 percent in 2034. Mr. SMUCKER. Okay, that--debt held by the public. But it will be significant increase in---- Secretary YELLEN. It is now about 100 percent, so---- Mr. SMUCKER. Yes. Now 97, it would be about--it would be increasing. So it would be a significant increase in the debt. Secretary YELLEN. A small increase in the debt. Mr. SMUCKER. Yes, a significant increase in the debt. I want to refer also to your report on the fiscal health that came out just a month or two ago of the country. And you show that, given current financial policies, including that in your budget within 75 years we will just continue to see that increasing, it would be at 513 percent, or above 500 percent of GDP at the end of a 75-year period. You say in that report the current policy is not sustainable, and the cost of delaying policy reform is significant, will make it much harder to implement changes that will affect that trajectory. Do you think that is a real threat to the country going forward? Secretary YELLEN. Are you referring to the Social Security report there? Mr. SMUCKER. No, I am referring to your report on the nation's fiscal health done by the U.S. Treasury, signed by you. Secretary YELLEN. Okay. So we need to enact policies to make sure that the debt stays sustainable and we are on a fiscally sustainable path. And the President has proposed over $3 trillion---- Mr. SMUCKER. So let's---- Secretary YELLEN . Of deficit reduction---- Mr. SMUCKER. Let's talk about that. We have already established that the debt will increase significantly under this budget. So where do you get the three trillion in savings? Where does that come from? Secretary YELLEN. Well---- Mr. SMUCKER. Because you are not decreasing spending. Secretary YELLEN. Well, in some areas there are spending decreases. Mr. SMUCKER. Not overall. Secretary YELLEN. But most of it comes from additional tax revenues---- Mr. SMUCKER. Because we are allowing---- Secretary YELLEN . Because revenues have been-- -- Mr. SMUCKER. Because we are allowing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act rates to expire. Correct? Secretary YELLEN. Partly, but not---- Mr. SMUCKER. About two trillion of three trillion. About two trillion---- Secretary YELLEN. But not for---- Mr. SMUCKER. You are projecting an additional two trillion in revenue---- Secretary YELLEN. We are projecting---- Mr. SMUCKER . And counting that towards debt-- -- Secretary YELLEN. We are projecting, in addition to that, a higher corporate income tax, moving that up to 28 percent, putting in place Pillar Two---- Mr. SMUCKER. So Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit for the record an article from the Washington Post that shows the $2 trillion and talks about that being included in the budget, and then shows a significant portion of that will be taken by families who are earning less than 400,000. Secretary YELLEN. He is explicitly---- Chairman SMITH. Without objection, so ordered.   Secretary YELLEN. He has explicitly said that he will not agree to raise taxes for people making under $400,000. Mr. SMUCKER. So I think it is more important---- Secretary YELLEN. And that is not any proposal of his. He has not said---- Mr. SMUCKER. So I think it is---- Secretary YELLEN. He would allow everything to expire. Mr. SMUCKER. It is more important to look at---- Secretary YELLEN. That is just wrong. Mr. SMUCKER. I think it is more important to look at what he has proposed, rather than what he said. And very clearly, the $3 trillion in revenue, or in reduction, what you are calling a reduction in debt, includes a significant amount coming from families who are earning under 400,000 per year. Secretary YELLEN. Well, that will have to be paid for. Chairman SMITH. Thank you. Ms. Sanchez. Ms. SANCHEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Secretary Yellen, it is always an honor to have you here. I want to thank you for your testimony and for taking the time to answer our questions today. With you at the helm, Treasury has helped the Biden Administration rebuild and strengthen our economy for the benefit of American workers and families. Together we have made real progress in terms of lowering costs for American families, from childcare to health care to housing, not to mention creating 15 million jobs on President Biden's watch. The President's latest budget shows that this Administration is committed to building out a fairer, more level playing field in our tax code. We need to recalibrate our nation's tax system to drive benefits towards working families who need the most, instead of the wealthy who benefitted for the most part, under the TCJA. I want to hone in on a small but very powerful way that Treasury recently helped families navigate our tax system. This tax filing season the IRS launched a key cost-saving tool with Inflation Reduction Act funding. For the first time, certain eligible taxpayers could choose to file their returns online directly with the IRS for free. More than 33,000 Californians opted into that pilot program, and it is pretty clear that Americans are hungry for an efficient, free, and direct filing option with the IRS. Because for a lot of Americans and a lot of my constituents, filing their taxes is confusing, it is frustrating, and it is time-consuming, and often times very expensive. Not everybody has the time or the disposable income to work with a paid tax preparer, and I think that all of our constituents can benefit greatly from a free and easy-to-use tool that helps them file accurate returns but, more importantly, make sure that they aren't leaving tax credits on the table. Secretary Yellen, I understand that the initial Direct File pilot was limited in scope, and I can understand how, when you have got a pilot project, keeping it small and nimble would allow the IRS to carefully track uptake, as well as the participant feedback. What has Treasury been hearing from taxpayers who actually took the opportunity to file their taxes online for free and directly with the IRS? Secretary YELLEN. So what I can tell you today--we haven't completely analyzed the information--is that the pilot was very successful. There was increasing interest from taxpayers during the five-week interval it was available, and taxpayers shared that they found Direct File easy to use, completed the process in about an hour. And on average, taxpayers have been spending an average of 13 hours and $270 preparing their taxes each year. So the preliminary evidence suggests that this has been a very successful experiment. Ms. SANCHEZ. It warms my heart to hear that. Can you talk to how the Direct File can help families understand their eligibility for and their ability to claim certain tax credits like the Child Tax Credit or the Earned Income Tax Credit? Secretary YELLEN. So I believe I have--you know, I have not been through the entire--I have seen a demonstration. But the program, I believe, walks people through those areas to make sure that they are alerted to it and understand their eligibility. Ms. SANCHEZ. Yes, I know that often times people aren't even aware of certain tax advantages that they can claim, and the Direct File helps them to understand those. I want to give you in the last minute that I have of my time an opportunity to respond to the--somebody talked about inflation and costs going up. And unfortunately, inflation is a real thing. But how does our inflation rate compare with that of most modernized countries around the world? And can you talk to the fact that, if we allow certain provisions of the TCJA to expire but keep in place other provisions, how that is going to benefit working families? Secretary YELLEN. Well, with respect to inflation, inflation has come down considerably. And the measure that the Federal Reserve focuses on most over the last 12 months ran at 2.7 percent. But what is important to households, of course, they see that the prices of many goods they bought pre-pandemic are higher--not all, but some--is that their wages have gone up by more than that. So their purchasing power, their inflation- adjusted incomes are higher, not lower. And for example, even this morning we saw new data come out on the employment cost index that measures compensation. And it was up in nominal terms and in inflation-adjusted terms it showed that, over the last year, compensation on average his increased just under a percentage point for most families. So people in--generally are better off in spite of the price increases. But we know we have more work to do. And President Biden is very focused on areas where he can lower costs, whether it is health care premiums, household energy expenses that will come down as a--because of the Inflation Reduction Act, drug prices, and the like. And so this remains a concern to many households, and it is something that is a high priority, getting costs down further. Ms. SANCHEZ. I thank you for your time. I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Mr. Hern. Mr. HERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Secretary, thank you for being here today. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter for the record an article from Tax Notes titled, ``Gain and Little Pain from New Bermuda Corporate Tax.'' Chairman SMITH. Without objection.   Mr. HERN. Thank you. Madam Secretary, as you might be aware, Bermuda is introducing its new corporate income tax that will take effect in 2025. Bermuda entities will be able to mark up their intangible assets to their estimated market value, and under the new law they can amortize those assets over 10 years for tax purposes. Madam Secretary, this creation of a new deferred tax asset also results in the deferred tax expense. As you know, under general guidelines provided by the OECD for Pillar Two that you negotiated, deferred tax expense or these amortized deductions will not trigger minimum tax liability that could be imposed by other globe-participating countries. Bermuda has no intention of giving up its ability to attract business through the tax code. Other countries are adopting similar measures to maintain their status as an attractive jurisdiction at the expense of United States multi- nationals. We know about Singapore. We know about Ireland, the things they are doing to maintain their ability to use their tax code to lure companies there. Madam Secretary, are you concerned about the fact that Pillar Two is creating a new tax subsidy race where countries enact Pillar Two taxes, but offset the higher tax costs with tax subsidies in the form of qualified refundable tax credits and other incentives like what Bermuda is doing? Secretary YELLEN. Well, the idea of Pillar Two is to level the playing field. And countries that refuse to raise their tax, corporate tax, rate up to the minimum, countries that participate and enact the minimum can, in effect, tax companies in tax havens that haven't done it. Mr. HERN. But Madam---- Secretary YELLEN. You have cited an example. I am not aware that this is something that is broad-based, but if it is it would certainly concern me, and it is something that I would be prepared to look into. Mr. HERN. Well, Madam Secretary, we have all seen what Ireland has said about putting a cap on recurring revenues. We have seen what Singapore said in refundable tax credits. We have seen what China does in direct tax payments or direct access--or cash payments to their companies to be able to offset the taxable income so that they, in effect, from the look at it, that the minimum tax level would be hit. But companies in those countries are getting subsidies through direct credits that offset that and take it backwards, where ours aren't direct. Ours are not refundable. We have to actually earn income to be able to utilize those. Question two: Is this Administration concerned that Pillar Two incentivizes subsidy warfare that puts our adversaries like China at a competitive advantage? Secretary YELLEN. It would concern me if it has incented that, but I am not aware that that is broad based at this point. And in our case, many of our tax credits such as the green tax credits, the LIHTC credit, are being treated as refundable. As I have emphasized previously, we are working to make sure that the R&D tax credit also will be something that firms can-- -- Mr. HERN. But---- Secretary YELLEN . Benefit from. Mr. HERN. But Madam Secretary, I think you just validated that countries have the ability to make certain credits refundable to offset the minimum tax that other countries or OECD can lie claim to. China can do it. I think that you are going there evidences the fact that they are not always transparent in what they do, since all of their companies are basically owned by the CCP. Madam Secretary, I have got a longer question here, but it pertains to the same thing. I think there is a lot of work to be done. As you know, the committee, the Republicans on the committee, went to the OECD and expressed our concern and made it very clear that Pillar Two is not going to take place under a Republican-led Ways and Means Committee, and we are not going to give away our tax dollars. In fact, it is said time and time again about how many tax dollars, U.S. taxpayer dollars would go around the world, upwards of 200 billion. I know you said that was JCT's outward look. But I think it is important for everyone to know--and you know this to be certain--corporations don't pay taxes. The people that work for the corporations, the consumers of the products of those corporations, and the owners of those corporations pay the taxes to increase pricing for whatever the commodities are. In fact, Forbes, Brookings, Tax Foundation, Cato, and many, many others have said that consumers pay 31 percent of the new taxes, workers pay 38 percent of the taxes. All of those people, for the most part, make less than $400,000 a year. So they are going--about 70 percent of the tax increase will be paid by people making less than $400,000 a year, some portion of that. So I think it is disingenuous, as my colleague from Pennsylvania said, to say that no one is going to pay a single cent, as outlined in the White House's conversation about policy, going forward. It is just disingenuous. It is not factual, and it is not honest with the American people. One other thing that you said is that the labor participation rate was better today than it was pre-COVID. I know you---- Secretary YELLEN. For adults. Mr. HERN. I know you selectively picked an area. Secretary YELLEN. For adults. Mr. HERN. It was 63.3 percent on March 2020. Today it is 62.7, overall workforce. Secretary YELLEN. I said---- Mr. HERN. When you don't have the luxury as an employer, as I did for 35 years, saying I am only going to hire people working--you have got to be 25 years old or 54 years old. Secretary YELLEN. We have an aging population. And as people retire, we know that labor force participation overall will decline over time. Mr. HERN. Mr. Chair, I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Thank you.  Chairman SMITH. You are good? Ms. CHU. Yes. Chairman SMITH. Ms. Chu. Ms. CHU. Secretary Yellen, I heard your comments earlier about the success of the Direct File pilot program, and I was so glad to hear why it was a success. And I especially want to have you address some things that Republicans and the private tax prep industry are saying. They are attacking the numbers of the filers, 140,000 filers, to show that the pilot was a waste of money because there are 19 million who were eligible and that this was unnecessary. And yet, what I see is that there were a lot of obstacles to the program that the IRS was able to overcome. And actually, I would have called it a resounding success. So can you tell us why it was considered a resounding success, considering the obstacles that there were? And what considerations will go into the decision to extend the pilot? Secretary YELLEN. Well, let me say that this was an experiment, and it was deliberately introduced in a phased way, starting at small scale. It was only available to most filers for five weeks in a subset of states that decided to participate. So for that amount of time 140,000 people using it and expressing positive reactions to the experience I would certainly call a success. Additionally, because it is an experiment, only relatively simple tax situations could use it. If an individual went on and it turned out they had the kind of income that wasn't incorporated into the first iteration of this program, they were directed to do something else. But this saved a lot of taxpayers, even in this first stage, a lot of money that they normally spend and a lot of time. And there was customer service available for anybody that needed it. And so overall, I believe we will see that the experience was a very positive one. Ms. CHU. So it was deliberately at a number that could ensure its success, actually. Secretary YELLEN. That is right, to start in a phased way. Ms. CHU. Yes, and I want to also express appreciation because you also made it available in both English and Spanish. My district in the San Gabriel Valley includes many limited English proficient taxpayers who speak not only Spanish, but also Tagalog, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese. If the Treasury and IRS decide to renew the Direct File pilot, can you talk about how it could reach more taxpayers by expanding to possibly even more languages? Secretary YELLEN. Well, I am sure that would be something that would be considered over time. There are other things that could be incorporated in addition to expanding the kinds of income and deductions that are considered. You know, eventually, the information that the IRS gets on W-2s and other information reporting could be used to pre- populate returns, making it even easier. But these are things in the future if it is decided to continue with free file. Ms. CHU. Secretary Yellen, also I heard you talk earlier about the proposals that the Administration has to end tax breaks for the wealthy, and instead restore tax credits for workers and families like the Expanded Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit of the American Rescue Plan. We know about the powerful effects of these tax credits on reducing poverty, but can you talk about how these programs will impact the American economy and improve things for everybody? Secretary YELLEN. Well, I mean, a very good example would be the Child Tax Credit, which in 2021 lifted 5.3 million people, including 2.9 million children, out of poverty. We saw a 46 percent decline in child poverty in 2021. And this is not only beneficial to the children and their parents in the short term, but we know from many studies that when poverty is reduced for children, it redounds to their benefit over the remainder of their lives. Ms. CHU. Thank you. I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Thank you. There are several votes on the floor. The committee stands in recess until immediately after the conclusion of this vote series.  Chairman SMITH. The hearing will come to order. Mr. Carey is recognized. Mr. CAREY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Yellen, as you know, low carbon hydrogen can reduce carbon emissions and create much-needed American jobs. Ohio is well positioned to lead on hydrogen, given the state's proximity to the end markets, as well as its access to low- cost, abundant, and diverse energy feedstocks. I believe Ohio can be a leader in hydrogen production from natural gas, with carbon capture and sequestration, sometimes known as blue hydrogen. Our state has abundant storage capacity, carbon capture emissions, and unparalleled access to low-cost natural gas. But most importantly, we know hydrogen made with natural gas while using carbon capture and sequestration can produce very low emissions. Unfortunately, the Administration's recently proposed regulations for hydrogen production, tax credit 45V, could halt several of the proposed Ohio projects. Last fall, DoE selected the Appalachian Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub centered around the Ohio River Valley, an area that I know very well, as the official hydrogen hub. Natural gas will play a major role in the overwhelming majority of these projects. This hub alone would create up to 18,000 construction jobs, with about 3,000 of those jobs being permanent. Without a workable, flexible 45V guidance, many of the projects within the hub will be uneconomical. Clear, inclusive tax guidance can help increase much-needed economic certainty that there will be adequate supply of hydrogen to meet the needs of Ohio's industries that are already making investments to use hydrogen in their businesses. I recommend that the Treasury permit taxpayers to use actual EPA-verified greenhouse gas emissions data to calculate an accurate tax credit value, rather than being forced to use a baseless national average, as laid out in the proposed regulations. Companies investing in lower methane intensity natural gas to produce hydrogen should be able to demonstrate the low- carbon intensity of the produced hydrogen with EPA-verified data, then use the data to calculate the corresponding tax credit value. The proposal of the tax credit and the intent of Congress is to drive the incremental and continual reductions in the carbon intensity of hydrogen. Without this change to the proposed rule to permit hydrogen producers to prove the actual carbon intensity of their hydrogen, the 45V tax credit will drastically be--mischaracterize carbon emissions' intensity, which will stifle the development of low carbon hydrogen products and impede the Administration's goal at reducing the overall emissions. And I know this is probably not something that a lot of people talk about, but given the fact that Ohio does have the aquifers to hold carbon, it is something that is very important to our state. I only have a minute and 30 seconds. If you have a second, I wouldn't mind your response. Secretary YELLEN. Well, the hydrogen provisions of IRA are very important, and we have worked hard to put out a notice of proposed rulemaking that will provide some clarity and flexibility to let projects advance with the appropriate environmental safeguards. We have worked very closely with the Department of Energy and with EPA on the proposed regs, given their technical expertise, but this is very complex, and it requires evaluating lifecycle emissions. We have received many, many comments--I believe over 40,000 comments--on the proposed rule. I appreciate your comments, and we promise that we are sifting through them and need to reconsider what the appropriate response is. So what I can say is that we will take this input seriously as we work to revise the regulations. Mr. CAREY. Well, I do appreciate that. I just want to say, again, with the developments that we have in place, Ohio looks to get 18,000 construction jobs, 3,000 permanent jobs. This could be a very big, very big economic factor for the State of Ohio. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Thank you. Ms. DelBene. Ms. DelBENE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Madam Secretary, for taking the time to be with us here today. And thank you for your attention to the needs of working families and struggling Americans, and for the work that you do to keep America globally competitive. Secretary YELLEN. Thank you. Ms. DelBENE. Madam Secretary, I first want to give you a chance to clarify the Administration's position on the Child Tax Credit, something I am a big supporter of. I know that some assertions were made, and you didn't have a chance to respond. So I want to give you a chance to respond. Secretary YELLEN. The President is supportive of the Child Tax Credit, and he has proposed to extend it in his 2025 budget, and has been supportive of Wyden and Smith also, the provisions on the Child Tax Credit that are included there. Obviously, it has made a tremendous difference when it was in effect in 2021, reduced child poverty by 46 percent, and is very important, and an important provision that really helps working families. Ms. DelBENE. Absolutely. And I would love to see us put that in place and make that permanent. So that is work we are going to continue to focus on. The Inflation Reduction Act also included a historic $80 billion investment in the IRS, 20 billion which was rescinded by my Republican colleagues. But one of the key needs addressed by these funds was modernizing the agency's core technology infrastructure. As this technology is updated, I wondered if you could speak about how emerging technologies like artificial intelligence are being integrated into the IRS's work to provide services to taxpayers and to enforce tax laws. And how is the IRS addressing data privacy and security concerns inherent with such technologies? Secretary YELLEN. So the IRS certainly has already begun to use AI in its work. I am not an expert on this, but I know that they see great potential in terms, on the enforcement side, in being able to sift through tax returns of high-income filers and complex partnerships and corporations, and to identify which ones would be good candidates for audits and trying to uncover fraud and close the tax gap. You know, Treasury has a governance process where we are employing AI increasingly in Treasury's work, and we have put in place oversight and a governance process around that to make sure that it is used responsibly in accordance with the President's executive order. Ms. DelBENE. Also, under your leadership, Treasury recently closed a loophole in our Russian seafood ban that previously allowed fish caught in Russia to still get to the U.S. if processing occurred in a third country like China. The ban is working, but unless our allies act in concert, American seafood will remain at a competitive disadvantage to Russian seafood in foreign markets. Madam Secretary, I wondered how can Treasury push our allies, who are also large seafood importers, including Japan, Canada, the EU, and the UK, to cut off seafood trade with Russia? Secretary YELLEN. So I must admit I am not intimately knowledgeable in what we are doing on this particular aspect of sanctions. Ms. DelBENE. Okay. Secretary YELLEN. But we are constantly working with our allies to try to coordinate our sanctions so that they are effective. Ms. DelBENE. And then one I know you will have--and I probably won't give you enough time on this--but I wondered if you could talk about how suggesting the U.S. will never implement Pillar Two makes it more difficult to get the changes that we would like to see. Secretary YELLEN. In---- Ms. DelBENE. Pillar Two of the OECD. Secretary YELLEN. To see the changes, how does it make it more difficult to---- Ms. DelBENE. About how, when folks are suggesting that we are never going to implement Pillar Two, how that makes it more difficult for us to get the changes that we would like to see. Secretary YELLEN. Well, this was a global agreement. The United States led the push on this, and we have argued since day one that Pillar Two is something that is good for the entire world. We have pushed our allies now on the order of 40 countries have adopted it, most major countries, and I think they see it as a failure on our part not to be willing to adopt it ourselves. And so it does undermine our ability to exhibit leadership with our allies. Ms. DelBENE. Thank you. My time has expired. Thank you, Madam Secretary. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SMITH. Ms. Malliotakis. Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Thank you very much for being here. I am proud to represent Staten Island and Brooklyn, where you are from, and---- Secretary YELLEN. Thank you. Ms. MALLIOTAKIS . Fort Hamilton High School says hello. Secretary YELLEN. Thank you. Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. And I wanted to speak with you specifically about fentanyl and the involvement of the Communist Chinese Party. I know you recently returned from a trip from fentanyl (sic). You specifically talked about the money laundering that is involved. We know that Communist China is subsidizing the production of these fentanyl analogues that are now illegal in the United States and in China, but yet they are exporting it, killing, as you know, 100,000 Americans annually. A lot of it is going through the drug cartels in Mexico, in particular when they are subsidizing the production of this fentanyl in China. NPP and ANPP are two fentanyl precursors that we know specifically the Mexican drug cartels are using. So according to the Congressional Research Service, U.S.- destined illicit fentanyl appears to be produced clandestinely in Mexico using these chemical precursors from China. Earlier this month you reported on your trip that you were creating a joint Treasury-People's Bank of China cooperation and exchange on money laundering. So I just wanted to know where this group is at, what you think we will be able to derive from this to help save these American lives that are being lost, sadly, because of this interaction between the CCP and the Mexican drug cartels. Secretary YELLEN. So I think fentanyl is a critical issue, as you have indicated, and Treasury is doing everything that we can to stem the flow of precursors from China to Mexico and the illegal sale of fentanyl from Mexico into the United States. I have also visited Mexico to discuss the fentanyl issue and to enhance our cooperation with them. In the case of China, President Biden and President Xi, when they met--I guess it was in November in Woodside--agreed to jointly tackle fentanyl, which was a very good development. Meetings have been taking place. As you noted, in my recent trip--I guess it was two weeks ago--to China, we agreed to establish a special work--sort of dialogue or work plan around illicit finance. We have had one meeting so far that has been devoted to that topic, and fentanyl certainly is one of the key issues, although we are looking more broadly at illicit finance beyond fentanyl. But China has agreed to cooperate with us to try to stem the sale of these precursors into Mexico and other places, and this is an area of cooperation. Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. So it is your understanding that these money laundering organizations in the PRC are acting outside of the CCP's control? Secretary YELLEN. I think so. It is not my understanding that the CCP is positively directing this activity, but that it is taking place among Chinese firms. And we need their cooperation to clamp down on those firms. We have sanctioned some, but there are many smaller firms in China that I believe are involved in producing these precursors and other equipment that is needed. Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. The U.S. Department of Treasury and the Office of Foreign Assets Control has so far sanctioned more than 65 mainland China or Hong Kong-based persons for illicit fentanyl trafficking. And we also seen the DoJ take some action indicting three of the PRC-based companies. So I am glad to see that we are having some action taken. These--any of these firms--again, everything in China obviously has the government's involvement in it. So my concern is more that the manufacturers of this fentanyl are being subsidized by the government. They obviously control the banks in China. And then, on top of it, these PRC-based companies. So I am just wondering how much we can trust them as partners. I am hoping that you are making some progress in that. But the reality is that, you know, we are seeing this increase, not decrease. More Americans are dying as a result of this fentanyl that is streaming from the PRC to the Mexican cartel. Part of it is because of our open southern border, thanks to the President's 60-plus policy changes when he came in. So I just hope that you will work diligently, and I trust that you are, to really try to hold China accountable for this type of activity that we are seeing that are killing so many Americans. Secretary YELLEN. It is a real American tragedy, and we will do everything and are doing everything we can to stem the flow of these drugs into our country. Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Thank you very much. Chairman SMITH. Thank you. Ms. Sewell. Ms. SEWELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Secretary, Madam Secretary, welcome again to our committee. I want to talk to you about equity and the President's charge to his cabinet at the very beginning of his Administration to really, really try to level the playing field and have equity be one of the hallmarks of that. And I had an opportunity to sit with you. I think we had breakfast together. During the last Congress Congressman Richie Neal put together a racial equity initiative within Ways and Means, and had a chance to talk to you about some of the things that you were thinking about doing in terms of equity. The budget is truly a reflection of what we value. We spend money on those things that we value. I want to commend this Administration and yourself for including in this budget expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child Tax Credit, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. I was a bond lawyer before I was a Member of Congress, and new market tax credits are a way to really help depressed and distressed communities. Can you talk a little bit about how the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit will seek to level the playing field and our equity initiatives within Treasury, frankly? Secretary YELLEN. Thank you. I think all of the initiatives that you mentioned, the New Markets Tax Credit, which we are proposing to make---- Ms. SEWELL. Permanent. Secretary YELLEN . Permanent, and also add a track that would be particularly focused on the most distressed communities, the Earned Income Tax Credit would be extended to single individuals with low incomes. It was done in the ARP. Ms. SEWELL. Yes. Secretary YELLEN. And this would make that permanent. Of course, the Child Tax Credit has been critically--when it was expanded in 2021, critically important in reducing child poverty, reduced it by 46 percent. And---- Ms. SEWELL. Amazing. Secretary YELLEN. Yes. Ms. SEWELL. And so that in the fiscal year 2025 budget, that you would actually make permanent the Earned Income Tax Credit--and some of those are very, very important. Secretary YELLEN. Very---- Ms. SEWELL. I noticed also that the President's budget provides a new mortgage relief credit. Can you talk a little bit about what that one is? Secretary YELLEN. Well, home ownership for people who don't already own homes, first-time buyers, is almost prohibitively expensive. First of all, mortgage rates have been so low for so long that it has created a kind of lock-in across much of the country, where people don't want to sell their homes to buy new ones because they will lose the benefit of the low mortgage rates they have locked in. And then, with house prices having gone up, and now with much higher interest in mortgage rates, it is almost impossible for first-time buyers. So the President has proposed a pair of tax credits. One would go--$10,000, I believe--to purchases of new homes, and the other would go to individuals who are willing to sell their homes to try to get rid of some of that lock-in. But we know that affordable housing, and especially starter homes, is an area where we really need to do a lot to increase availability. Ms. SEWELL. Increase availability and also access, as well as making sure that we are leveling the playing field so that all Americans have an opportunity to live the American dream. Secretary YELLEN. Yes. Ms. SEWELL. Going back to the New Market Tax Credits, I represent my home district, Alabama's 7th district, and we have utilized New Market Tax Credits to help underserved urban but also rural parts of my district to actually--we are beneficiaries of this. As you know, New Market Tax Credits really let cities and counties and non-profits to give an opportunity to really help a distressed area. Can you talk a little bit about why that permanency with New Market Tax Credits is so critical? Secretary YELLEN. I think it--because this is intended to generate private investment and is very successful in doing it, knowing that the program will be there over time, I think, generates much more interest in the part of the private sector. Ms. SEWELL. And more certainty, yes. Secretary YELLEN. Right. Ms. SEWELL. Absolutely. Thank you so much. I yield back the balance of my time. Chairman SMITH. Mrs. Miller. Mrs. MILLER. Thank you, Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Neal. And welcome here today, Secretary Yellen. I am going to be on a little different track than my friend from Alabama. I am deeply concerned about many of the actions that the Treasury Department and President Biden's Administration are taking. Unfortunately, every American is feeling the constant pinch of inflation, higher interest rates, and lower purchasing power. Despite this, the Treasury and the IRS appear to be only trying to make our constituents' lives worse instead of better. For example, the IRS has continued to illegally delay the implementation of the Democrats draconian 1099-K threshold. The Treasury Department has issued weak foreign entity of concern definitions to that which fail to protect American tax dollars from flowing to Chinese companies. Guidance coming from the Treasury Department on energy tax incentives are blocking traditional energy communities from participating in the future energy economy and leaving them behind. You have led an unprecedented attack on American taxpayer privacy by overseeing the expansion of IRS snooping, and yet are failing to crack down on the leaks of sensitive taxpayer documents. Furthermore, the IRS has wasted millions of taxpayer dollars on its unauthorized Direct File program. The Biden Administration has shockingly announced its plan to raise taxes by over $7 trillion next year. You said last month under oath that there is no plan to protect middle-class taxpayers from these planned increases. On the world stage we have surrendered the U.S. tax base to unelected global bureaucrats at the OECD and failed to protect the American tax system from what I think of as a heinous international interference. On every front the American taxpayer loses, our nation becomes weaker, and our global adversaries are rewarded and emboldened. Secretary Yellen, I am deeply concerned about our domestic industry's reliance on Chinese technologies and investments. As the recently appointed chairwoman of the supply chain's Tax Team, I look forward to working with my colleagues to improve upon the broken IRA's energy credits, protecting a competitive corporate rate, and ensuring that the United States is the best place to invest as it was under President Trump's historic tax cuts. I have introduced two bills, the Protecting American Advanced Manufacturing Act and the End Chinese Dominance of Electric Vehicles Act, to improve on the foreign entity of concern definitions for the 45X and the 30D tax credits, respectively. The current agreements establish a dangerous precedent that will take the U.S. decades to reverse by creating a future where our automotive and other industries are heavily reliant on foreign technologies. Without immediate passage of both of my bills, Chinese entities will receive billions of American tax dollars every single year. Secretary Yellen, yes or no, does the Biden Administration support taxpayer dollars funding Chinese entities? Secretary YELLEN. Well, when it comes to electric vehicles, the IRA, which obviously the Administration supports, has foreign entity of concern restrictions coming into effect this year and next, which will severely curtail--almost prevent entirely--participation of Chinese firms in producing components or minerals or processing---- Mrs. MILLER. That is not yes or no. Secretary YELLEN . That go into batteries. Mrs. MILLER. That is not---- Secretary YELLEN. So that is a very significant restriction that will protect our supply chain. With respect to 45X, that is a credit that Congress directed to go to any company that undertakes certain advanced manufacturing---- Mrs. MILLER. Reclaiming my time---- Secretary YELLEN . In the United States. Mrs. MILLER . By allowing these Chinese companies to maintain control of the technologies, the intellectual property, and the supply chains, all the while receiving American taxpayer subsidies, how will this encourage U.S. companies to develop the technologies to become less dependent upon China and our adversaries? It doesn't. Does the Biden Administration share any of my concern that China is using various IRA credits to deepen its influence on our domestic manufacturing industries? Secretary YELLEN. The United States is doing everything we can in Treasury in implementing the IRA to strengthen our supply chains and make them less vulnerable to China. Mrs. MILLER. Well, I continue to remain skeptical on the environmental and economic benefits behind your decision- making, and I do urge swift passage of my bills to further protect the United States manufacturing. And I yield back my time. Mr. SMUCKER . Ms. Moore. Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And of course, Secretary Yellen, it is always good to be in your presence with your just wise experience. This committee is really blessed. I want to ask you a couple of questions related to domestic violence, sexual violence. The 2013 amendments to the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, which I had the privilege and the opportunity to lead, really made some changes to prohibit housing providers who have used the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit from using domestic violence, dating violence, or sexual assault and stalking as grounds for evicting the victim, or denying subsidies or admissions due to an abuser's act. The IRS, of course, is not just the administrator of the housing tax credits, it has a duty to ensure that the Low- Income Housing Tax Credit program's compliance is with VAWA. I think we have had some informal communication with the Treasury Department in this past decade where the Treasury has disavowed any responsibility to set out some sort of guidance on this. And in fact, in 10 years we have not seen that done. And so, I was wondering--and I am joining Ms. Tenney. She and I are writing you a letter to try to find out what the status of why you don't feel that you need to comply or, if you do, if you will. Madam Secretary. Secretary YELLEN. Well, first, let me thank you for your work on this very important initiative, which I think is critically important for domestic violence victims, and the reauthorization explicitly extended VAWA's protections to applicants and tenants in LIHTC properties. Now, if there is specific issues or guidance that you think is necessary, I would like to put you or your staff in touch with people at the Treasury or/and IRS, and we would be glad to work with you. Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Well, thank you with that, because the national housing authorities have put together some sort of guidance that seems to be working, and we will share that with you. Mr. Smucker and I, as an extension of this discussion, I want to talk about something we think is extraordinary, and that is judgments that are made for victims of sexual assault. If you are a victim of sexual assault and you get a settlement or an award, you will be able to get a settlement and not pay taxes on it if you can prove that there is some physical harm. But as an example, I mean, if you were put in a situation where you were forced to strip naked and parade, you know, through a gang of perpetrators, and no one penetrated you, you might get a judgment out of that, but you would have to pay taxes on it. And we don't think that that is fair. And so we are looking, Mr. Smucker and I, to changing the law so that there is a presumption of a physical abuse that would meet the requirements for some kind of income exclusion. And so we are hoping that you will see this in the positive light that we see it. Secretary YELLEN. We would be glad to work with you on that. Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. I have one question with my remaining time, just to sort of understand what your stance is on minerals. You just had a previous discussion with Mrs. Miller that I thought was very compelling, and she talked about China, our subsidizing China in minerals. And I guess I didn't really understand that discussion. What I am concerned about is that there is a tremendous cost to extract and process critical minerals domestically. And by denying the monies to this domestic activity, are we in fact subsidizing or enabling minerals from other places? Secretary YELLEN. Well, I mean, we are making it really all but impossible to get the $7,500 subsidy if the minerals they are processing take place in China, and the IRA contains incentives to produce and process these either domestically or among friends---- Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Well, Madam Secretary, why aren't we allowing the credit---- Mr. SMUCKER. The gentlewoman's time has expired. Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Okay. Why aren't we allowing the credit when it is produced domestically? Could we do that and still prevent outsiders? Secretary YELLEN. The credit is available when the minerals are processed domestically or in countries with whom we have a free trade agreement. Mr. SMUCKER. The gentlewoman's time has expired. Ms. Tenney is recognized for five minutes. Ms. TENNEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And also, thank you to Secretary Yellen for your service and for being here today and this long session today. I just wanted to kind of go back to a couple of things that Congresswoman Sewell said, and go back to the New Markets Tax Credit issue, and the authority which ends in 2025. And we teamed up and wrote a note, a letter to you, about six months ago indicating why it has taken so long to get this underway, why we can't do what the Treasury has done in the past, doing this as a lump-sum program when it was authorized in 2015 and 2016. And as you know, as we are coming down to a deadline, the deadline is the end of 2025, and obviously, this is an urgent issue so we can make sure that we get the monies directed to these needy communities we have. Representative Sewell and others on the committee are also very concerned about this, but also to get to other parts of my district. I have a very rural, sprawling district in upstate New York, and this New Markets Tax Credit has been a help. We did get a response from Acting Assistant Secretary Corey Tellez, but it was six months later, and really just said, ``We are working diligently.'' So it wasn't, you know, a progress report of any substance. And we are just wondering if there is any way you can give us an update today. Where are we with this? Can we get it done in a way that we did in 2015 and 2016 to get these credits expedited as time is running out on this program, and very much needed program, in a bipartisan way? Secretary YELLEN. So you are talking about previous credits that would qualify this year? Ms. TENNEY. No, we are talking about the current credits that haven't been--you have indicated that some of them, in the letter that we received in February in response to our September 2023 letter, you have indicated that you have made a number of awards, but the program isn't completed and there are a lot of rewards outstanding. And we have people out all across the country waiting to be able to get approved through Treasury. What is the holdup? Can we get an expedited--I mean, we really just want a simple answer. Can we get your attention on that, and make sure this comes out? Secretary YELLEN. I will look into it. I am assuming that we will award these, but I don't know the timetable when we will---- Ms. TENNEY. Right. As you know, construction projects, they are very---- Secretary YELLEN. We will try to get back to you. Ms. TENNEY. Thank you. They are very expensive, very--and we want to--you know, these investments are made, and then the credits aren't out, and we have got people willing to come into our rural and needy communities to invest, and we just want to make sure that they have the certainty that they need to do that. The second question I have for you--and I just wanted to check on Treasury's progress--as you know, these horrific attacks on Israel by Hamas on October 7, we have seen a dangerous rise in anti-Semitism across the country. Notably at universities, we are seeing this play out every day today, including my own home state of New York, even upstate New York, where I have nearby Cornell University, Syracuse University, and many other campuses there. We are seeing these anti-Semitic demonstrations, support of terrorist groups like Hamas, and there are even reports indicating that numerous U.S. charities are suspected of funneling this money to Hamas, or from Hamas to various ties to organizations that we have designated as financiers of terrorism by the Treasury Department. I just wanted to know where we are with Treasury today, and what are we doing to make sure that we are cracking down on Iran and other groups with sanctions, with support for cutting down their ability to fund these groups that we think are coming here. And I just wanted to just say thank you to Chairman Smith. Earlier this year we did do--or earlier, I think, or later last year we did a hearing on what is happening on our campuses, and a deep dive into where this money is coming from. A lot of it looks like it is coming from Iran, coming through, you know, not-for-profits, whether they are 501(c)(3)s, (4)s, and using our IRS structure, but also Treasury may be backing off on sanctions on Iran. And I want to know where we are with that today. And if you could, quickly comment on are we going to continue to press Iran in its ability to be a state sponsor of these things? Secretary YELLEN. Well, it is really at the absolute top of our agenda to crack down on Hamas and Iran. We have taken a large number of actions. I would be glad to detail them all out for you, but---- Ms. TENNEY. Can you just give me a---- Secretary YELLEN . Both against Iran and Hamas---- Ms. TENNEY. Can you--yes, can I just reclaim my time? Just, like, clarify my question, if you would, please. How are we increasing sanctions on Iran again now, as we see what is happening, and we know that there has got to be some kind of linkage? Are we cracking down on sanctions on Iran right now? Is that something Treasury is continuing to press? Secretary YELLEN. Absolutely. We took a set of sanctions--I believe it was just last week--to crack down on oil sales by Iran's military to China. We have cracked down on their provision of UAVs that are going to Ukraine and other places and being used by terrorist groups against Israel. We have taken numerous, numerous actions to go after Hamas financing, using every channel we are aware of, and we are working jointly with our allies to do this. Ms. TENNEY. Thank you. Well, we appreciate that. My time has expired, but we really need to crack down and get the sanctions in place to really put a dent Secretary YELLEN. We are---- Ms. TENNEY. Into Iran's ability to fund this. We know that this is what is probably happening, and where the money is probably coming from, somehow using the channels of our good- intentioned, not-for-profit laws. So---- Mr. SMUCKER. The gentlewoman's time has expired. Ms. TENNEY . I appreciate that. Thank you. Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Kustoff is recognized for five minutes. Mr. KUSTOFF. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Madam Secretary, for appearing today. I am over here to your left. If I could, Madam Secretary, you have got a unique position. You have chaired the Federal Reserve. You have got the position you have got now. Is the Fed's target rate for two percent inflation, is that still a real number? Is that the goal, and is that attainable? Secretary YELLEN. Well, the two percent inflation target was codified as part of the Federal Open Market Committee's policy a number of years ago, and it remains the goal. And more, as Chair Powell has said, the committee is absolutely committed to achieving that. At this point, inflation using the metric that they use is 2.7 percent. It has come down substantially from its peak, and they continue to put in place a policy that they consider to be restrictive to move it down further. Mr. KUSTOFF. Well, let me ask---- Secretary YELLEN. I believe it is definitely obtainable. Mr. KUSTOFF. Let me ask you about that, because you have used the word ``substantially decreased'' several times during this hearing. Your predecessor, Lawrence Summers, in an interview on April 10 on Bloomberg TV, said, ``You have to take seriously the possibility that the next rate move will be upwards rather than downwards.'' This morning he released a statement that said this morning's ECI, Employment Cost Index, and housing price inflation figures confirm what I have suspected and feared: Inflation is not securely trending to target levels. He goes on to say, ``Note that the ECI has accelerated from previous quarterly, semiannual, and annual levels. I suspect it has been understating labor cost inflation of late because of reduced work requirements associated with the WFH. The home price inflation figures are also a cause for concern that shelter inflation is not durably declining. With higher interest rates and higher unit prices, rents will at some point reaccelerate. Note that, as many have pointed out, bottlenecks have been easing over the last year or so, reducing inflation momentum. This will not forever--this will not be forever and, given geopolitics, may reverse. Financial conditions are now loose by historical standards, all reasons why the Federal Reserve is in a treacherous environment. Should have been more careful about easing signals, and now should be very cautious about possible rate cutting.'' It is really hard to disagree with anything he said, isn't it? Secretary YELLEN. Well, he is a person who has been wrong in the past. He said that it would absolutely take a recession to bring inflation down, and that turned out to be a serious misjudgment. I don't want to talk about appropriate monetary policy. Mr. KUSTOFF. Fair enough. Secretary YELLEN. That is not my job; it is up to the Fed. But on house prices I would say I consider it highly likely that over the next year house price inflation, shelter inflation will come down considerably. And the reason I believe that is that, if you look at the market for new rental apartments and rentals of new single-family houses, those rental prices have stabilized or, in some cases, declined. And the reason that shelter costs continue to increase as much as they are is because tenants who have leases, when the leases end and their rents are renegotiated, they come up to market. So it takes a while---- Mr. KUSTOFF. Thank you. Let me reclaim my time just to ask you---- Secretary YELLEN . But it will come down. Mr. KUSTOFF . Do you not agree with anything that former Treasury Secretary Summers said in that statement? Secretary YELLEN. I agree with some of it, but I can't go through it with you. Mr. KUSTOFF. Okay. Fair enough. Secretary YELLEN. Yes, I don't disagree with everything in there. Mr. KUSTOFF. Let me, if I can, in my remaining seconds--in 2018 we passed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. I think that the bill was critical because it fixed a one-size-fits-all regulatory structure. Obviously, you are chairman of the Financial Stability Oversight Council. I know that you all meet soon. My concern is with that bill, which is Senate Banking Bill 2155, it allowed financial regulators to tailor or calibrate regulations for certain banks based on their respective characteristics and risk levels. The one I am particularly concerned is I am concerned about the Basel III framework, the rules relating to Basel III and long-term debt requirement proposals, especially as it relates to regional banks. My ask of you is, when you chair, you will pay particular attention to the concerns of regional banks as it relates to these rules. Secretary YELLEN. Well, this is really under the purview of the banking supervisors, the Fed, the FDIC, and the OCC. FSOC doesn't have jurisdiction. Mr. SMUCKER. The gentleman's time is expired. Secretary YELLEN. But they have said they are reconsidering the rules that they put out. Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Kildee is recognized for five minutes. Mr. KILDEE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Secretary Yellen, for your presence here and for the work that you have been doing on behalf of the American people. I have been proud to work with this Administration on implementing some, I think, monumental pieces of legislation: CHIPS and Science Act, Inflation Reduction Act. Both laws are supporting American workers, creating American jobs, particularly in manufacturing. And I have been especially focused on manufacturing more solar panels and solar components here in the United States, rather than having such a reliance on China for these goods as we do now. And I know you understand that. In fact, recently you said, and I quote, ``China's overcapacity distorts global prices and production patterns, and hurts American firms and workers, and I could not agree with that statement more. That is exactly right. China's state-backed solar industry is flooding the global market with cheap products, undercutting our American workers at a time when we are trying to build that capacity. So to meet this challenge, of course, we need policy that drives demand for U.S.-manufactured solar products across the solar supply chain. And we can do this with strong domestic content rules. And so my question to you comes out of a concern that domestic content guidance may leave out some critical pieces of the solar supply chain. And so I am curious what Treasury's plan is to ensure that the final domestic content guidance for solar facilities incentivizes onshoring of the full U.S. solar supply chain and reduces our dependance on China for components like, for example, polysilicon or wafer. Can you comment on that? Secretary YELLEN. Sure. Well, we put out some initial guidance on domestic content. It was an interagency effort, and we relied heavily on advice from the Department of Transportation in applying the Buy America rules that are referenced in the text of the IRA in determining the categorization of clean energy products. We also consulted with the Department of Energy. Now, we have gotten a lot of public feedback. Some of it-- much of it is from stakeholders throughout the solar supply chain, and this is feedback we will take into account as we revise the regulations. Mr. KILDEE. I do very much appreciate that, and I think it is such an important element to make sure that we are looking at the entirety of that supply chain because there is a lot of American jobs that could be stood up simply on some of those elements. And I wonder if you could also comment on another subject that you and I have discussed before, and that is the 48D semiconductor investment tax credit. Making sure that we expand the U.S. supply chain for semiconductors starts with polysilicon--and again, you and I have discussed this--a substance that is 99.5 percent of semiconductor chips. The U.S. has a technological advantage on polysilicon production, but China and other countries are catching up, and that is one of the reasons that the new tax credit in the CHIPS and Science Act is intended to spur that investment in the semiconductor supply chain. And so I wonder if you might comment on your willingness of Treasury to continue to work with us on final guidance for the 48D tax credit that supports those critical elements of the semiconductor supply chain. And as you know, for me it is important that that include American-made chip-grade polysilicon. Secretary YELLEN. So again, I would say that we put out some proposed rules and received a lot of feedback. We explicitly asked questions about the appropriate scope. I would also say that the Department of Commerce that administers a grant program, we are coordinating closely with them to make sure we cover the entire supply chain. I can't preview the likely final rules, but we have been very attentive to comments that we have received on this. Mr. KILDEE. I very much appreciate that. And as you know, Congress takes these actions, we have an interest in the implementation process. It is the responsibility of the Administration, but we have an interest, as the authors of the legislation, to ensure that congressional intent is being realized. So I appreciate your willingness to work with us, and I particularly appreciate your service to our country in the various roles that we have worked together. You do a fine job and are doing a particularly fine job at this hearing. Secretary YELLEN. Thank you so much, Congressman Kildee. I appreciate that. Chairman SMITH . Mr. Steube. Mr. STEUBE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Secretary, on March 6, 2024, the Committee on Judiciary and Select Committee of the Weaponization of the Federal Government released a staff report on the financial surveillance in the United States. Have you had a chance to review that? Secretary YELLEN. I am aware of it, but I haven't reviewed it in detail. Mr. STEUBE. Well, I would encourage you to read it because it is pretty appalling to the American people. Last week Chairman Jordan sent you a letter regarding the financial surveillance without a warrant of American citizens. The date--actually, let me go back. So Mr. Chairman, can I add that report to--I ask unanimous consent to add that report to the record. Chairman SMITH. Without objection.   Mr. STEUBE. Last week, April 24, Chairman Jordan sent you a letter regarding the financial surveillance without a warrant of American citizens. Are you in receipt of that letter? Secretary YELLEN. We are in receipt. Mr. STEUBE. Have you read it? Secretary YELLEN. I have looked at it. Mr. STEUBE. You have looked at it? Does that mean you have read it, or is that---- Secretary YELLEN. Yes. Mr. STEUBE. Okay. Do you intend to provide the committee with the SARs, as requested in that letter? Secretary YELLEN. We will respond to the committee. Mr. STEUBE. Are you going to provide the SARs, as requested in the letter? Secretary YELLEN. Well, those reports are strictly confidential under the law, and I am not prepared to discuss any one in particular. Mr. STEUBE. I am just asking if you are going to comply with the letter that Chairman Jordan who has oversight over your Department and the cabinet, if you are going to comply with the letter. Secretary YELLEN. We will respond to the letter, and I don't really have more to say about that. Mr. STEUBE. Under the Biden Secrecy Act, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, an agency under your control at the Department of Treasury receives vast amounts of data covering millions of financial transactions involving everyday Americans. Is that correct? Secretary YELLEN. Through FinCEN receives reports. Mr. STEUBE. And is it correct that FinCEN received 20.6 million currency transaction reports in 2022? Secretary YELLEN. I am not sure. It could be. Mr. STEUBE. It could be, roughly, more, less? Secretary YELLEN. I don't know the number. Mr. STEUBE. But you would agree that it is millions of reports? Secretary YELLEN. Probably, yes. Mr. STEUBE. It is also true that FinCEN received 4.3 million suspicious activity reports in 2022, which was nearly double the amount received by the agency in 2019. Secretary YELLEN. I don't know. Mr. STEUBE. You don't know at all, even though it is an agency---- Secretary YELLEN. I don't know if they received double the previous year, I really don't know. Mr. STEUBE. But SARs typically gets millions of reports. You would agree with that statement? Secretary YELLEN. I don't know if it doubled, though. Mr. STEUBE. Okay, well, I am sure your staff can provide you with that information. Secretary YELLEN. I am sure they can. Mr. STEUBE. That is an agency under your--so you don't know is what you are telling me. Secretary YELLEN. I could look into it, but I don't happen to know. Mr. STEUBE. Okay. Doesn't the data in these reports include important and sensitive private and financial data? Secretary YELLEN. Well, these are private data only available to law enforcement. Mr. STEUBE. But it includes data of American citizens, their private financial data. Correct? Secretary YELLEN. Well, on transactions that are regarded as suspicious. Mr. STEUBE. And their data, correct. Secretary YELLEN. And potentially illegal. Mr. STEUBE. The sensitive personal financial data included in this report is held in a database. Correct? Secretary YELLEN. Yes. Mr. STEUBE. Neither FinCEN nor any Federal law enforcement agencies need to get a warrant to access this private financial data. Is that correct? Secretary YELLEN. I don't think you need to get a warrant, but it is only shared subject to strict confidentiality. Mr. STEUBE. But you don't need to get a warrant. Secretary YELLEN. Not to the best of my knowledge. Mr. STEUBE. Are you aware that in 2021 FinCEN emailed financial institutions suggesting search terms including, and I quote, ``America first,'' ``Trump,'' and ``MAGA'' to use in identifying transactions that may indicate, and I quote, ``involvement in riots or potential violence''? Secretary YELLEN. This is activity that took place under the previous administration, not under the Biden Administration, in close proximity---- Mr. STEUBE. No, this is 2021. Secretary YELLEN. This is---- Mr. STEUBE. Twenty-twenty-one. Secretary YELLEN. This is before President Biden's inauguration. Mr. STEUBE. No, it is after. Secretary YELLEN. And after January 6, there was concern about potential disruption of his inaugural. And FinCEN worked as it is instructed to do with financial institutions to try to uncover who was involved in January 6---- Mr. STEUBE. So were you aware of the FinCEN emailing the financial institutions with those search terms? Secretary YELLEN. I am now aware that there were communications that took place. In some cases, I believe financial institutions suggested to this group search terms they had used that had been helpful in identifying potential perpetrators of January 6. Mr. STEUBE. FinCEN also worked with the FBI in early 2021 to determine certain transaction thresholds for SARs. These include certain weapons-related transactions. Do you know how many SARs were filed as a result of the FBI and FinCEN's coordination at that time? Secretary YELLEN. No. The only reason that--I believe that weapons were involved. It is never a search term used on its own that results in anything. It is a way of trying to narrow the scope of search for individuals who, based on other information available to the financial institution, may have been guilty of illegal behavior. Mr. STEUBE. Without a warrant. Mr. Chairman, I ask that the letter from Chairman Jordan to Secretary Yellen dated April 24 is added to the record. Chairman SMITH. Without objection.   Chairman SMITH. Mrs. Fischbach. Mrs. FISCHBACH. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Secretary, for being here today. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed by President Trump, provided tax relief to millions of middle-class Americans and their families. The doubling of the standard deduction, the doubling of the Child Tax Credit, and the adjusting of individual tax rates saved working-class people significant money on their tax bills. President Biden's comments have already been mentioned several times today, and he told the American people flat out that he intends to let the Trump tax cuts expire and remain expired. You have repeatedly said today that the President has no tax plan, only principles from which he will negotiate. Let me just say that allowing the Trump tax cuts to expire on middle-income Americans seems like a misguided principle to me. So let me ask you this, Madam Secretary. If the Trump tax cuts expire, and President Biden fails to pass his tax plan, which actually currently doesn't exist, which Americans will pay less in taxes? Secretary YELLEN. President Biden has made absolutely clear that he opposes increasing taxes on people earning less than $400,000, and he supports cutting taxes for working people and families with children to give them more breathing room. And-- -- Mrs. FISCHBACH. Reclaiming my time---- Secretary YELLEN . He will work with Congress to try to achieve that. Mrs. FISCHBACH. Ma'am, reclaiming my time, thank you, isn't it true that nearly all middle-income individuals and families would pay more with the expiration of the Trump tax cuts? Secretary YELLEN. Some individuals would, but President Biden has said he would oppose allowing tax cuts to expire for people making under $400,000. Mrs. FISCHBACH. But my understanding, though, is that he doesn't really have a tax plan, he just has ideas. And so how are you going to translate that into---- Secretary YELLEN. There will be a negotiation over what to do when these tax cuts expire. And the President, as he does in many other situations, will negotiate with Congress. Mrs. FISCHBACH. But I think that, if you let these expire, you are going to see increases, you are going to see increases. And without an alternative, I mean, we just--right now what you are saying is there is just an idea out there. Secretary YELLEN. There are principles. Mrs. FISCHBACH. Right now there are principles, okay, principles. Same thing. There is no real plan. And you are going to let these--he is going to let these tax cuts that-- people are recognizing that there are--they are seeing right now expire with just principles that are---- Secretary YELLEN. There will be a negotiation. Mrs. FISCHBACH . Hanging out there. Secretary YELLEN. And in that negotiation he will oppose any tax increases on families earning under $400,000 at the same time that he will oppose keeping in place benefits that went to the wealthy. Mrs. FISCHBACH. And maybe you addressed this earlier, but is he going to tell us what these principles are? Is he going to give us some concrete---- Secretary YELLEN. He has told you what the principles are. Mrs. FISCHBACH. Okay, all right. Secretary YELLEN. I am telling you what the principles are. Mrs. FISCHBACH. Well, then, there is just not--I mean, we are supposed to rely on these ideas, principles, whatever you want to call them, when we have solid tax cuts right here, and they shouldn't be allowed to expire because just, you know, a single parent making $52,000 a year with two kids would pay an average of $1,474 more in taxes if these expire. A married couple with two kids making $85,000 a year would pay an average of $1,661 more in taxes if these expire. A retired married couple making $48,000 a year would pay an average of $340 more in taxes if these expire. That is real dollars to these people and--you know, that are paying these taxes, and are recognizing and are seeing these breaks under the Trump tax cuts. And so to just say that they--you are going to--for the President just to say he is going to let them expire doesn't seem very responsible because these are real people that are paying these--that would pay more taxes. And so I guess we just are supposed to rely on the principles and the idea that he will come up with something through negotiation to help these people. So with that I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Mr. Schneider. Mr. SCHNEIDER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Madam Secretary, thank you for being here. As others have said, thank you for your work on behalf of our country and the American people. I am just briefly going to pick up on some of the things we have been hearing. But, you know, when we talk about--and you mentioned we laid out principles, and I think the principles have been very clear. What Democrats are trying to do is try to bring down costs for working families to help them make ends meet. In the American---- Secretary YELLEN. Exactly. Mr. SCHNEIDER. In the American Rescue Plan, we cut child poverty in this country by 50 percent through the child tax cut. And I think next year, given the chance, we are going to do that and not just try to cut it by 50 percent, but in the wealthiest country in the world no child in this country should be living in poverty. And we shouldn't be willing to accept that. We are investing in housing. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit that addresses a critical need for families and workers around this country to have access to quality housing. And R&D, we grow our economy by investing in innovation, and these are things that the 2017 tax law didn't do. So I could spend my whole five minutes on that. I don't want to spend my time, I really want to hear more from you. But one of the things that we did with the Inflation Reduction Act, among many great accomplishments, was we made the single largest investment in climate change. It was truly remarkable. And part of that was a tax credit for Sustainable Aviation Fuel that I was proud to lead on. And I am working to make sure that we implement that and extend that for the future. So at the risk of asking a question you may not be able to answer, but can you give us any sense of the criteria or objectives that Treasury is using in thinking about how to issue the rule for Sustainable Aviation Fuel, and any update on forthcoming guidance that we might be expecting? Secretary YELLEN. Absolutely. First of all, I want to thank you so much for your leadership on the SAF credit, and I want to tell you that today is the day that--we are releasing a notice today that will catalyze innovation in the aviation industry and incentivize the production of cleaner and more sustainable aviation fuels. And I think it will make the United States a leader in decarbonizing aviation. So we are announcing the release today of a notice that will provide clarity around eligibility for the SAF credit. And at the same time we will also be releasing an updated model of the GREET model, which is applicable--will enable firms to determine exactly the credit that they are eligible for under the SAF. I think it will provide the clarity that people have been looking for, and this should occur this afternoon sometime. Mr. SCHNEIDER. Great. Well, thank you. I am so excited to hear that not only is it forthcoming, but it is coming today. I know that is critically important. Aviation accounts for more than two percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Through Sustainable Aviation Fuel we have the possibility of doing more than a 50 percent reduction and maybe getting it down further from that. So I can't emphasize how important this is. I also know that you have a hard out, so I am going to yield back the balance of my time so that more of my colleagues will have a chance to ask questions. But I thank you for your time. Secretary YELLEN. Thank you, Congressman. Chairman SMITH. Mr. Moore. Mr. MOORE of Utah. Thank you, Chairman. Secretary Yellen, thank you for being here. I remember our visit last time. I appreciate these days. I know they are long days for you, with a lot of questions coming from multiple directions, but this one of the more important hearings that we will do all year. So this is going to sound like a gotcha question to start off with. It is not. I want to expound on it and have a really thoughtful discussion on the corporate tax rate, because it is based on our conversation last time and a continuation of that. But would you agree, can we at least say that we agree that tax policy does have an impact on our economy? Secretary YELLEN. It can, yes. Mr. MOORE of Utah. Tax policy does have an impact. So this is the part that is frustrating me as I hear from my Democratic colleagues today about, you know, A, we have got such a great economy today, and we have had such a great, strong recovery, and all this kind of--the bare bones of our economy are still in place from the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act. We saw strong economic growth. We saw real wage growth come from the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act. And I can speak so favorably about it, I wasn't even in Congress then so I am not even boasting about this. As I watched COVID hit and throw everything off in the world, and then, when Democratic control took over in 2021, there was massive spending but the same tax code, the same tax rate still existed. Some things were starting to trail off. I hope to be able to reestablish the R&D tax credits, as well as everybody on this committee, basically. But we have seen a strong economic recovery. Unemployment is low, and I can absolutely point that to the fact that we have had a consistent, simpler tax code that strengthened middle class and lower-income Americans since 2017. The part that concerns me is a book that I recently read. It is called, ``Never Split the Difference.'' The tax rate was 35 percent. In 2017 we lowered it to 21. And now President Biden just wants to do 28. It almost feels like lazy to me that we are just going to say, well, okay--because you admitted last time you were here when we were having our conversation, ``I do believe it was too high, and now I believe it is too low, so we are just going to split the difference.'' But the part that I want to hit on here is, according to the Tax Foundation, the top combined marginal rate on corporate income under current law is actually 25.6 percent. And the President's proposal would increase that to 32.2, a corporate tax rate that would be the second highest in the OECD, behind Colombia. The Joint Committee on Tax has shown that most of the cost of a 28 percent corporate tax rate would be borne by Americans making less than $500,000. What specific analysis can you point to demonstrating that raising the corporate tax rate won't impose burdens on low- and middle-income Americans? Secretary YELLEN. Well, I think all of the analysis I am familiar with shows that TCJA, including the corporate tax cut, was a regressive tax cut that disproportionately benefitted the wealthy and the large corporations, and the corporate tax cut enriched corporate shareholders at the expense of the alternative, which would have been benefits to middle-class families. Mr. MOORE of Utah. So if I could jump in---- Secretary YELLEN. It promised an investment boom, and that certainly never materialized. You said that the economy did well, but I don't believe it did well because of that piece of legislation. Mr. MOORE of Utah. Okay, thank you. Secretary YELLEN. It simply busted the deficit---- Mr. MOORE of Utah. And I will reclaim my time, because I don't believe you can argue. And if you want to come to Utah's 1st district, you can hear from companies in that district where their real wage income grew for their frontline employees. This wasn't just for all of the shareholders like it is often times communicated. We will see that, as we just try to split the difference on this tax policy, that that cost will go directly to the consumer. Take a---- Secretary YELLEN. Well, there is---- Mr. MOORE of Utah . Retail company or a Home Depot or a Lowe's. If we put that extra tax burden on them, there is only one place to put it. They still have to pay their employees. They are going to have to raise income--they are going to have to raise prices on consumers. And I don't know of any analysis that would refute that. Secretary YELLEN. Well, there is an interesting recent paper that shows that there were some benefits that went to wage earners from the corporate tax cut, but it was almost exclusively to the highest-income earners within corporations, that virtually none of it went to the massive workers at these firms. Mr. MOORE of Utah. And that hasn't been my experience talking to actual companies in my actual district. I know it is considered a strong talking point from my colleagues on the left, but that hasn't been the experience. Companies had extra income that they could reinvest in their companies, they would keep it onshore. And this is the part that I just dig into that frustrates me so bad. And I am already over time, and I appreciate the conversation. And I believe next time we will continue to talk about the corporate tax rate. Secretary YELLEN. Thank you. Chairman SMITH. Mrs. Steel. Mrs. STEEL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to highlight the provision from TCJA that has been bipartisan: support Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction, or FDII, incentives for companies to keep intellectual properties here in the United States. This allows companies to invent and make new creative works here, including my home state of California. We are also competing with countries who provide massive tax incentives to attract innovative companies, and FDII ensures that United States remain the best place to develop global solutions and technologies for the future, and we must protect this provision created in TCJA. This is the reason why I am introducing Growing and Preserving Innovation in America Act. This bipartisan legislation will permanently preserve the current FDII deduction rate. Secretary Yellen, you have been here for such a long time, and I really appreciate it. And I just want to do the follow-up question that Congressman Wenstrup asked you about China and the OECD, that under TCJA that U.S. corporate tax lowered to 21 percent. And China is 25, but there are actually certain companies up to 15 percent. So they are--kind of like corporate tax rate is low. If the United States raises corporate tax rate to 28 percent, and we adopt a new global minimum tax rate, the U.S. will forfeit tens of billions of dollars that we have been talking about. That Pillar One, we are going to lose about $120 billion. And Pillar Two, about $40 billion. And, you know, we did the CODEL trip to France and Germany. The French government didn't even want to meet us because they are gaining about $4 to $5 billion from Pillar One and Pillar Two. So this will hurt the U.S. economy, I believe. And the plan being discussed fails to hold China accountable. I am on Select Committee on China, so we have been really watching it, you know, what is going on with China. So if I heard right that you assumed earlier that China will join the OECD agreement, what assurances do you have that they would truly comply with the rules, and not continue to abusing the system like they have done so many times on the international level? And why should we give the CCP economic advantages on the back of American taxpayers? Secretary YELLEN. Okay, well, you covered a lot of different things, but let me respond on China and Pillar Two. You know, this is an agreement that contains an enforcement mechanism. That is one of the reasons it is so powerful. If a country doesn't go along with it, doesn't raise their minimum tax rate on their multi-nationals to the agreed-upon level, other countries that have complied and put it into effect can tax firms based in countries that are not going along with it. That applies to China. If China doesn't raise taxes on its multi-nationals and they operate in the United States, the U.S. will impose taxes by--it is called the Undertaxed Payment Rule. We will impose taxes on those Chinese corporations and we will collect the tax revenue. And we will make sure that those companies do pay a 15 percent minimum tax so that they don't have unfair competition with our companies. Now, if China imposes the tax, they can collect the tax revenue. But if they won't do it, we are going to collect the tax revenue and we are going to tax the Chinese firms. And this works to our advantage, not to China's. Mrs. STEEL. I am not really sure that--you know, China has been always, like, you know, for them, that stealing is much cheaper than, you know, researching, and it just takes longer time. It is much faster. So I don't know they can really follow the rules and then they are going to raise taxes to comply with the, you know, global minimum tax. So having said that, I want to go to my question that another expiring provision in the TCJA is enhanced standard deduction. This is a guaranteed tax deduction for hard-working Americans who want to file simple tax returns. And you are talking about actually simple tax returns and about 140,000 people filed it because the IRS's system that has been changed. If this provision expires, taxes will go up on hard-working families. Do you support the increased standard deduction created by TCJA, and support keeping these individual tax cuts for hard- working Americans making less than $400,000 who do not want to maneuver a more complex tax system that exists---- Mr. HERN . The gentlelady's time is expired. Secretary YELLEN. The President supports no tax increases on families making under $400,000. Mrs. STEEL. I'll just make just one statement, because most of new audits from IRS are targeted more on taxpayers making under just $200,000, so that $400,000 are kind of like assumed numbers. But you know what? Having said that, I have a few questions, and I am going to submit them in writing.   Mr. HERN. Thank you. The gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Evans, is recognized for five minutes. Mr. EVANS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. HERN. Will the gentleman suspend? We have about 28 minutes left of your time, Madam Secretary, so we are going to try to keep it on time going forward here. And I would appreciate all of the members to respect that time. Thank you. Secretary YELLEN. I don't have---- Mr. HERN. Go ahead, Mr. Evans. Mr. EVANS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary YELLEN. I have to leave at 2:15. Mr. HERN. Two-fifteen? We had better talk fast, then.  Mr. EVANS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank you, Madam Secretary, for being here today. I wanted to thank you for--I wanted to talk about Social Security, one of the most foundational anti-poverty programs that our country has ever created. Something I want to stress, that it is an earned benefit. So the question I want to ask, Madam Secretary, the House Republican Study Committee proposed Social Security budget would cut Social Security by $1.5 trillion over the next decade. Can you please describe how this plan would impact the recipients for whom Social Security makes up either the majority or the entirety of their income for retired years? Secretary YELLEN. Well, Social Security is a critical program that keeps millions, tens of millions of people who are retired or seniors out of poverty. And President Biden has made it clear he would never support cuts in benefits to those individuals. Mr. EVANS. So what exactly in your mind that you think this House Republican Study Committee is attempting or suggesting? Do you have any idea what you think they are trying to suggest? Secretary YELLEN. I am not sure exactly what they are suggesting, but they may be suggesting benefit cuts, raising the retirement age. I am not sure what is in their list of suggestions. Mr. EVANS. That is basically what I want to get an understanding. If you don't have any idea, we don't have any idea. So I want to be very clear. We thank you for all that you have done, and we thank for the service that you have done. We really appreciate and value that. Thank you. Secretary YELLEN. Thank---- Mr. EVANS. I yield back to the chairman. Secretary YELLEN. Thank you, Congressman. Mr. HERN. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania. By the way, I chair that committee. So if you need the help on what that policy is doing, I would love to sit down and chat with you. With that I recognize the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Fitzpatrick. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Thank you. Thank you, Secretary Yellen. Thank you for testifying here today on the President's budget for fiscal year 2025. Secretary Yellen, in the current budget plan outlined by this Administration it assumes that the tax cut and jobs provisions will expire at the end of 2025. And under that plan the Child Tax Credit and the standard deduction both would be cut in half. So my first question, Secretary Yellen, could you walk me through this decision by the Administration, and how you plan to protect the economic security of Americans who qualify, as it is, Americans on the lower end of the economic scale that benefit the most from these two provisions? Secretary YELLEN. Well, the President's budget is built on a baseline that assumes, as is in current law, that features of TCJA expire. And he makes a number of proposals, but he hasn't offered a detailed plan for how he would meet his pledge to make sure that none--no family earning under $400,000 would see an increase of their taxes when that occurs. He has articulated principles that he would take into a negotiation. He has made clear he stands ready to work with Congress, and what the principles would be, that no family making under $400,000 should see an increase in their taxes. Because that is costly to implement relative to his budget, he will work with Congress to agree on a set of raisers that would cover the cost of that. Mr. FITZPATRICK. So turning to free trade agreements, this Administration has been interpreting the term ``free trade agreements'' so broadly that they have expanded it to include critical mineral agreements. Specifically, we saw the USTR brokered a CMA with Japan without any congressional approval for such a deal. So my next question, Secretary Yellen, is why did the Administration proceed in brokering this agreement without any input from Congress, which it is required to do? And what plans are there in the future, as far as you are concerned, that the Administration intends to take to ensure that Congress is notified of any FTA between the U.S. and any other country? Secretary YELLEN. Well, certainly, the Administration agrees that Congress has an important role here. I think our objectives align in that our objective is to reduce our dependence on China and other foreign countries of concern, and to have more resilient supply chains by producing more at home and importing more from our partners and friends. And in that regard, especially when it comes to critical minerals that we are short of or lack, we are looking to expand sources of supply among our friends. We have consulted closely with Congress over the last year- and-a-half, with leaderships and staff members of this committee on these matters. We want to be sure that we are working with you and that our incentives are in alignment. Mr. FITZPATRICK. And lastly, Madam Secretary, I need to address China. I know it has been a topic of robust discussion today. China currently controls up to 50 percent of the electric vehicle battery supply chain. Troubling, to say the least. Your Treasury Department put out a rule this past December that defined battery component in a way that effectively favors Chinese manufacturers. Specifically, under this rule a foreign entity of concern can produce all materials and parts of the battery component, and the electric vehicle can still remain eligible for a tax subsidy. I know this was raised earlier. So Madam Secretary, just lastly, can you please speak as to why the Treasury decided to define battery components this way? And can you explain what your Department is doing to help U.S. manufacturers and not Chinese manufacturers? Secretary YELLEN. I mean, I would be glad to get back to you and try to understand better what you are focusing on here, but the FIAC rules are very strong, and indicate that battery components starting this year made by a foreign entity of concern can't be included in any car that receives the $7,500 credit. Next year that expands to critical minerals and their processing. Mr. FITZPATRICK. I have a follow-up with you, Madam Secretary. We will do that, but my time has expired. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. HERN. I thank the gentleman. The gentlelady from Texas, Ms. Van Duyne. Ms. VAN DUYNE. Thank you very much. Secretary Yellen, earlier today you committed to closing the carried interest loophole. Unfortunately, this has become a popular punch line that is just not true. For a lot of new and emerging entrepreneurs across the country who don't come from Wall Street or wealthy backgrounds, carried interest is the sweat equity that they have put into their business. It is the work that they have put into growing their business. And I look forward to working with my tax team colleagues to better educate Members of Congress on the opportunity that carried interest provides, and the longstanding tax policy principles that it is based on. Last year you testified and said, ``Progress has been made on inflation, but there is still work to be done.'' Unfortunately, not much has changed in the last year. Inflation hasn't gotten any better. Energy prices haven't gotten any better. And we continue to see housing prices at record highs. Under this Administration prices have increased nearly 20 percent and real wages have fallen by nearly four percent. That affects people who are making less than $400,000. And yet the President's budget put out earlier this year continued growth policies that exacerbate this problem. In your testimony you claim the Administration is taking actions to bring down the cost of key household expenses like energy. But that is not true. The Biden Administration's desire to harm American energy continually through tax increases on domestic energy production is the weaponization of the tax code against all Americans, including those making less than $400,000. During your Senate Finance hearing, you said traditional energy companies have had significant tax benefits that tilted the scales. In the Treasury Green Book, the Administration's tax proposal says, ``These traditional oil, gas, and coal preferences encourage more investment in the fossil fuels section that would occur in a neutral system, and this market distortion is detrimental to long-term energy security.'' Do you really believe that oil and natural gas production is detrimental to the long-term energy security? Secretary YELLEN. Well, to give preferences right now, when we understand the---- Ms. VAN DUYNE. Aren't you doing that with green new policy deals, giving preferences, picking winners and losers? Secretary YELLEN. Well, we pick winners and losers, but they have to be ones that are positive for what is an existential threat, which is climate change. Ms. VAN DUYNE. Okay. So you believe, then, that oil and gas natural production is an existential threat, and that that is somehow better to cut all of that production for our---- Secretary YELLEN. No---- Ms. VAN DUYNE . Long-term energy security? Secretary YELLEN. No one is saying to cut all that production. Ms. VAN DUYNE. So some is---- Secretary YELLEN. There is no--we will be dependent on this for---- Ms. VAN DUYNE. I reclaim my time. This Administration's goal---- Secretary YELLEN . A long time, but there is no reason---- Ms. VAN DUYNE . To shut down--the Administration's goal to shut down energy companies and change the rules to basically make it impossible to operate profitably. Secretary YELLEN. It is not--that is not the Administration's objective, but there is no reason why we should be giving tax preferences---- Ms. VAN DUYNE. But is tilting the scales toward green energy worth the security risk by buying oil from adversaries such as Venezuela? Secretary YELLEN. We are promoting clean energy and renewables---- Ms. VAN DUYNE. We are buying it from countries---- Secretary YELLEN . In order to---- Ms. VAN DUYNE. We are buying it from countries that produce it in a much dirtier manner than any place in the U.S. And that is---- Secretary YELLEN. We are going to switch to renewables. Ms. VAN DUYNE . What your policies are forcing us to do right now. Earlier you talked about the corporate rate in the U.S., as my colleague, Congressman Moore, has alluded to, the U.S. has been at a ``race to the bottom.'' Did the Tax Cut and Jobs Act lower the corporate rate to the lowest in the OECD? Secretary YELLEN. It is among the lower in the OECD. Ms. VAN DUYNE. I fail to see how this is the bottom, then. I mean, under the President's budget, according to the Tax Foundation, the U.S. would have the second--not the lower to the bottom, but would have the second--highest corporate rate in the world. Is this something that the Treasury is proud of? Secretary YELLEN. Over decades, corporate tax rates have declined---- Ms. VAN DUYNE. It would be the second-highest---- Secretary YELLEN . Around the world. Ms. VAN DUYNE . Corporate rate in the world. Secretary YELLEN. I don't believe that 21 percent is the second-highest---- Ms. VAN DUYNE. I have other questions, but I also want to-- -- Secretary YELLEN . In the world. That is certainly not---- Ms. VAN DUYNE . Make sure that some of my other colleagues have an ability to ask them. With my one minute left, I yield. Mr. HERN. Madam Secretary, I know we are close to your time, but I would ask for your indulgence to our Democrat on this side over here, Mr. Beyer from Virginia. Mr. Gomez, okay, from California. Mr. GOMEZ. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Beyer and I will be splitting this five minutes, so I will be quick. We took care of Jimmy Panetta so he couldn't get back in time, so we get the last five. One of the things is--first, let me just say I recognize that the President's budget proposal for fiscal year 2025 invests in working and middle-class families by making child care and housing more affordable. And these are two issues that I don't think we give a lot of attention to. Last year, during a retreat with the Ways and Means Democrats, Jack Lew came by and said there is two issues that in the near and long term will be dragging down the growth of our GDP: child care and housing. And it makes sense when you see almost those 2 issues combined eat up about 60 percent of a family's income, pre-tax. So one of the things we are trying to do through two caucuses I started was--the Congressional Dads Caucus--is child care, the Child Tax Credit. How do we focus on that? And then, at the same time, when it comes to more housing affordability. So I am going to kind of go out of order since we have limited time on my questions. But Secretary Yellen, can you detail actions the Administration is taking to provide desperately needed relief for America's renters? Secretary YELLEN. We are really looking to expand through any number of tax proposals and through expanding LIHTC, the supply of affordable housing. It is a critical problem facing America. Mr. GOMEZ. And one of the things that we see in my district, 78 percent of my district is renters. We know that this is getting worse. And also, even on the other side of the aisle, I have conversations with a representative from Nebraska, and I asked him, what is the number one issue facing your district? And he said housing affordability. So I think it is an issue that we need to tackle. Additionally, we know the Child Tax Credit had such an impact when it came to reducing child poverty in this country by making it fully refundable but also advanceable. I believe that advance ability is not given a lot of attention that it should get and should receive because, as a working-class person, $200, $300, $500 a month means that you can use that for formula, diapers, all those monthly expenses. Would you agree that paying the CTC on a monthly basis, which I know that we can do, rather than yearly, would help maximize the CTC's power to help working families? Secretary YELLEN. Yes, it would. I think it was very important, and the Internal Revenue Service worked very hard to make sure they implemented that right away. It was in the middle of the pandemic, and it required an heroic effort, but it made a big difference and we are very supportive of it. Mr. GOMEZ. Thank you. And with that I will yield the rest of my time to Mr. Beyer. Mr. BEYER. Thank you, Mr. Gomez. Madam Secretary, I greatly appreciated seeing your proposal for a minimum income tax of 25 percent on the ultra-wealthy. I was proud to work with Steve Cohen to turn this into legislation. Many cosponsors. It is ridiculous that the wealthiest 0.001 percent of Americans, on average, pay effective rates in the single digits. Many of them pay nothing. Can you talk to us about how that minimum tax would work? Secretary YELLEN. Yes. The President's budget would impose a minimum tax of 25 percent on total income, and income would include unrealized capital gains. It would only apply to taxpayers with more than $100 million in wealth, and it would not require, for those taxpayers who have highly illiquid assets, they could defer payment of it. Others could pay in installments so that it wouldn't be a huge hit in the first year. But right now, many wealthy people really never pay taxes on that during their lifetime. They borrow against it, live very well, and often can pass it on with step up of basis at death so that no one ever pays taxes on that, on those gains. Mr. BEYER. Thank you very much. One last question in 25 seconds. Are you thrilled with Direct Files so far? Secretary YELLEN. It is going great. It has gone really well. We are going to provide a thorough assessment, but all the anecdotal evidence we hear, people have really appreciated it, found it easy to use. It saved them, on average, $270 and something like 12 hours of work to file their taxes. And it is a great option. Mr. BEYER. Thank you very much. And I yield back. Mr. HERN. Thank you. Madam Secretary, this is your option. We have one member left. He can submit his questions, and he will give you those questions, or he can go now and---- Secretary YELLEN. Go for it. Go for it. Mr. HERN. Thank you for your indulgence. Secretary YELLEN. Last one. Mr. FEENSTRA. Thank you, Secretary Yellen. I truly appreciate you being here and at least giving me some grace and giving me some time. Thank you very much. So last week I sent you a letter on the decision by USTR to reverse digital trade policy at the WTO, which I would like to submit for the record. With the decision, the USTR determined that it will no longer defend against foreign governments' demands for American businesses to locate facilities, equipment, employees, and intellectual properties in those countries. In the Pillar One negotiations, market countries have sought taxing rights over companies selling into them, but those taxing rights are allocated on paper only, as we know. The local data storage requirements that would proliferate around the world do the opposite, reallocating taxing rights not on paper, but instead reallocating real economic assets that create a taxable presence in those countries. So in this year's Green Book, the President notes the concern of undesired incentives to locate certain economic activities abroad. But if local data storage requirements are allowed to proliferate, U.S. businesses will face not only an incentive to invest abroad, but will require to do so. This newly allowed method of discriminatory targeting of the U.S. companies for tax revenue is going to cost us, obviously, jobs and investment and IP transfers. So my question is, Secretary Yellen, did the Department of Treasury consult with USTR on the likely tax and economic impacts of this decision? I mean, did you guys work together? Did you talk about it at all? Secretary YELLEN. Well, this was really USTR's decision, and I honestly have to defer to USTR when it comes to Ambassador Tai's position that she has taken on the--you are talking about the WTO situation with digital trade. When it comes to Pillar One, we have had interagency coordination, and our position on this really remains completely unchanged. We are trying as hard as we can to get rid of digital service taxes that we regard as discriminatory against U.S. firms. Mr. FEENSTRA. And thank you for that. But you know it very well. If you look at it, I mean, obviously, our multi-nationals will have to build infrastructure, and that, obviously, will costs these companies jobs, and costs taxes that could be paid here. I mean, how do we square that up? Secretary YELLEN. You mean because of the WTO position? Mr. FEENSTRA. Yes. Secretary YELLEN. I am sorry. You know, I really just can't--I haven't been involved in that at all. We have generally opposed data localization requirements, and I don't think that has really changed significantly. But I honestly have to defer to USTR on that issue. Mr. FEENSTRA. Okay, and I appreciate that. I mean, it just seems like everybody is at odds here. The USTR is at odds with the Treasury. I mean, I just--and the WTO, I mean, I don't quite--I think we are going in two opposite directions. And I think the thing that we don't want is where our multi-nationals are paying taxes to other countries, and other countries are using us for a piggy bank. And I just feel like we are swaying that direction. Do you see that at all? I mean-- -- Secretary YELLEN. Well, we are really trying to oppose that in the Pillar One negotiations. We are trying to get rid of digital service taxes that are being imposed on our firms. Mr. FEENSTRA. Well, I would really appreciate that. I mean, but continue to look at that. Please do a deep dive into this, because what is going to happen is we are going to lose a lot of dollars when these infrastructures get moved to other countries, and losing jobs and IP transfers. So if you could. With that I will close down my comments. Thank you for being here. Mr. HERN. Madam Secretary, we would not want you to leave here without getting high praise and accolades from the gentleman from California, because I am sure that is what he wants to heap upon you on your way out. So Mr. Panetta, you are recognized. Mr. PANETTA. Thank you, Madam Secretary. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Secretary, I will be quick. I will focus on just one issue, and it is one that is important to me and my constituents in the 19th Congressional District, and that is housing costs. As you know, researchers have found that high housing costs can strain a local economy by slowing employment growth. If housing is unaffordable, local companies can struggle to attract and recruit workers. I have long advocated, especially on this committee, for building of more workforce housing, for making sure that there is a first-time home buyer's tax credit, for doubling the capital gains tax on home sales. We want to make sure that there is these types of tax credits to bolster housing. Can you explain how investment in housing, like the areas that I have talked about, can support the economy? And would the Department of Treasury support these types of investments, especially in workforce housing? Secretary YELLEN. Well, we are very concerned about shortage of affordable housing in places like California, but also many parts of the country. The President is doing everything he can to promote affordable housing. There are many proposals in the Green Book, including expansion of LIHTC and credit for first-time buyers and sellers of houses to get rid of some of the lock-in that has occurred because of the increase in mortgage rates. Mr. PANETTA. And I agree with you on the LIHTC, and I am a big supporter of LIHTC. However, what I found, especially in the 19th Congressional District, you have a number of people who work in our district, but they don't qualify for low-income housing. That is why I believe workforce housing is very, very important to ensure that people who work in the district can afford to live in the district. And so I am hoping that workforce housing is something that the Department of Treasury would be interested in. Secretary YELLEN. We would be glad to work with you on that. We are trying to do everything we can in this area. Mr. PANETTA. And I will take that as a closing answer. Thank you, Madam Secretary. I yield back. Secretary YELLEN. Thank you. Mr. HERN. I thank the gentleman. Madam Secretary, thank you for your time here before the committee, and thank you for extending your time. We stand adjourned, without objection. Members will have two weeks to submit questions in writing. Madam Secretary, thank you.
