THE ANNUAL TESTIMONY OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY ON THE STATE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM ---------- Tuesday, July 9, 2024 U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Financial Services, Washington, D.C. The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:09 a.m., in room 2128, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Patrick McHenry  presiding. Members present: Representatives McHenry, Lucas, Luetkemeyer, Huizenga, Wagner, Barr, Williams of Texas, Hill, Loudermilk, Mooney, Davidson, Rose, Steil, Norman, Meuser, Fitzgerald, Garbarino, Kim, Flood, Lawler, Nunn, Houchin; Waters, Velazquez, Sherman, Meeks, Scott, Lynch, Cleaver, Himes, Foster, Beatty, Vargas, Gottheimer, Gonzalez, Casten, Horsford, Tlaib, Torres, and Nickel. Chairman McHenry. The Financial Services Committee will come to order. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a recess of the committee at any time. Today's hearing is entitled, ``The Annual Testimony of the Secretary of the Treasury on the State of the International Financial System.'' I will note at the outset that this hearing has a hard stop of 1 p.m., which we will strictly observe. I now recognize myself for 4 minutes to give an opening statement. Secretary Yellen, I appreciate you being here today. From Europe to the Middle East to Asia, global unrest is creating additional challenges for the international financial system. There are also rising risks emerging from our own domestic failures here at home. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently warned that U.S. deficits and debt now present, ``a growing risk to the U.S. and global economy and should be urgently addressed.'' In last year's negotiations surrounding the debt ceiling, House Republicans secured historic guardrails on Federal spending with the Fiscal Responsibility Act. Unfortunately, the Biden Administration has undermined this bipartisan progress at every turn with reckless and expensive executive action. The government debt isn't just a challenge for America, nor is inflation a challenge for America alone, although it is distinctly worse than the rest of the globe. Total public debt globally is at a record high. Much of it is held by emerging market economies with poor creditworthiness and depressed interest rates that do not accurately reflect the default risk. This problem is exacerbated by opaque Chinese infrastructure lending through its Belt and Road Initiative. Communist China is now the largest creditor to the developing world. To add insult to injury, it remains one of the largest annual borrowers from the World Bank, despite assurances that these loans would be phased out. The Biden Administration is failing to leverage U.S. standing at the international financial institutions (IFIs) to block financing for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). At the same time, Treasury is proposing a multiyear process to stand up an entirely new bureaucracy to regulate private U.S. investment to China. To be sure, the recently-proposed rulemaking is a step in the right direction, and more responsible than other proposals that have been floated about this town. However, this approach will take years to implement, and lacks the urgency necessary to confront the generational threat posed by the CCP. We have an existing, time-tested sanctions regime that can have an immediate impact, and I urge you, Secretary Yellen, and I urge the Biden Administration to use it and use it forcefully. Any serious effort, whether legislative or administrative, to block global funding for the Chinese military-industrial complex must include the full blocking sanctions in Congressman Andy Barr's Chinese Military and Surveillance Company Sanctions Act. Treasury has also implemented its beneficial ownership (BO) reporting regime as the Administration's principal effort to crack down on the line of foreign actors in the U.S. financial system. There is bipartisan support in Congress for this reporting regime for two reasons: first, it was supposed to be narrowly targeted to strengthen our national security tools; and second, it was supposed to protect small businesses from duplicative reporting regimes. Thus far, Treasury has failed to adhere to congressional intent on both counts. America faces grave strategic challenges in Europe and the Middle East. The Biden Administration has rightly provided historic military and financial support for Ukraine following Russia's invasion, yet Treasury has undermined its own sanction efforts by allowing Putin to continue funding his war machine through a glaring loophole in its so-called oil price cap. Similarly, this Administration has wavered in both rhetoric and action after a promising initial response to Hamas' barbaric terrorist attacks on Israel last October. To begin to right the ship, Treasury must redouble its efforts to cut off funding for Iran and its proxies. If nonsensical and contradictory policies like these continue, allies will continue to question America's, and specifically this Administration's, leadership on the global stage. I yield back. The Chair will now recognize the ranking member of the committee, the gentlewoman from California, Ms. Waters, for 4 minutes for an opening statement. Ms. Waters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning. I would like to welcome you, Madam Secretary, before the committee today and applaud the work of both your leadership and President Biden's leadership. The Biden-Harris Administration is fighting every day for people by creating 15.7 million new jobs, doubling the average monthly number of jobs created during Biden's term when compared to Trump's first 3 years before the pandemic, increasing wealth and wages broadly, and steering our economy out of the throes of a pandemic made worse by the previous Administration. I also applaud President Biden for never backing down in the face of opposition. When the Supreme Court blocked his plan to cancel student debt, President Biden sought other ways to help America's student loan borrowers. To date, the Biden Administration has forgiven $144 billion in Federal student loans for nearly 4 million borrowers. This is what it looks like when we have a leader who puts the well-being of the American people above his need for revenge. From signing into law the American Rescue Plan and the bipartisan infrastructure law, which is making the U.S. economy the strongest in the world, to taking on companies saddling Americans with illegal junk fees, to cutting child poverty in half, our economy is stronger because of President Biden. I also commend Secretary Yellen's work to stabilize the banking system after last year's regional bank failures, as well as deploying $12 billion for community development financial institutions (CDFIs) and minority depository institutions (MDIs), and $10 billion for small businesses through the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI). I am working on a bill to build on the successes and the effectiveness of the SSBCI, and I look forward to working with you on that. And there is still more work to be done, especially on issues like housing, and President Biden has made housing a top priority of his Administration. On the other hand, the MAGA operatives have made their priority loud and clear. They have conceived a 920-page plan to undermine our government, our social safety nets, and our values as Americans. This Project 2025 is diabolical, so insidious, and so disturbing that everyone in this country needs to read it. They need to read it so they can understand the plan to take away their rights, their freedoms, and their democracy, and turn this country into a Christo-fascist state. You can read this garbage at www.project2025.org. Now, Project 2025 was written by former Trump White House staffers, Trump Administration officials, and the ultra right- wing Heritage Foundation. Banning abortion and contraception, abolishing the Department of Education, and taking over the Department of Justice so a Republican President can use the FBI to settle political scores are just a few of the low lights. Project 2025 would also gut agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Federal Reserve, and dangerously restructure the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and other agencies critical to the economy. Moreover, Project 2025 describes plans to withdraw from international financial institutions like the IMF and the World Bank, both of which have advanced U.S. democratic ideals all around the world. I yield back. Chairman McHenry. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Luetkemeyer, the Chair of our Subcommittee on National Security, Illicit Finance, and International Financial Institutions, for 1 minute. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, welcome, Secretary Yellen. Since we heard from you during last year's annual testimony, the global debt crisis has only grown worse. Russia continues its war against Ukraine, and with help from Iranian funding, Hamas perpetrated a heinous attack on Israel, our closest ally in the Middle East. Meanwhile, Communist China continues to threaten global economic security through unfair, even illegal trade practices, and threatens regional security with escalating aggressive actions against the Philippines and Taiwan. It is therefore bewildering, despite that behavior, why and how the CCP still receives over a billion dollars annually from World Bank commitments. Indeed, the global economic and security situation has deteriorated so dramatically during the 3\1/2\ years of the Biden Administration that I can't help but ask what have they been doing that could account for this? In the international financial system, the Administration's weakness on Iran sanctions and on energy in general is one obvious culprit. At the IFIs, the continued push for the green agenda through the evolution roadmap is another, prioritizing climate over the needs of 700 million people who remain mired in extreme poverty. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman McHenry. The Chair now recognizes the ranking member of our Subcommittee on National Security, Illicit Finance, and International Financial Institutions, Mrs. Beatty, for 1 minute. Mrs. Beatty. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Ranking Member Waters. And Secretary Yellen, thank you for being here today to testify. I would like to echo the remarks made by Ranking Member Waters. Over the last 3\1/2\ years, President Biden has helped restore the United States' leadership in a global economy. We are experiencing unprecedented levels of job creation, historically-low unemployment, declining inflation, and growing wages and wealth, the rebuilding of an economy that works for everyone. I want to thank you, Secretary Yellen, for the work that you have done to restore our leadership at the international financial institutions and to protect our economy and our national security. I also want to thank Leader Hakeem Jeffries and the Democrats for governing by giving the votes necessary to pass the debt ceiling, although we aren't in the Majority. I look forward to continuing to build on the historic work that you and President Biden and the Administration have done. Thank you. And I yield back. Chairman McHenry. Today, we welcome the testimony of the Honorable Janet Yellen, the 78th Secretary of the Department of the Treasury. Secretary Yellen, thank you for being here. You will be recognized for 5 minutes to give an oral presentation of your testimony. And without objection, your written statement will be made a part of the record. We welcome you back before the committee, and I will now recognize you for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE JANET L. YELLEN, SECRETARY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Secretary Yellen. Thank you. Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Waters, and members of the committee, thank you for the invitation to testify in my capacity as Chair of the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies. The United States built the international financial institutions 80 years ago with our allies and partners. Today, U.S. leadership at them is essential to our national and economic security. We work through the multilateral development banks (MDBs) to fight poverty and drive sustainable and inclusive growth, strengthening developing and emerging markets that are key trade and investment partners for the United States and addressing global challenges such as climate change, pandemics, and conflict and fragility that threaten to undermine global economic growth. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) provides crucial support to countries to help resolve debt problems, minimize negative spillovers to the global economy, strengthen governance, and restore growth. These institutions' strong balance sheets make U.S. contributions to them safe and highly cost-effective. They crowd in support from other partners, and the United States works as the largest or near-largest shareholder in all of them to make sure they use their funds well. These institutions are also the only realistic option for the United States to offer high-quality and transparent development financing at the scale needed to be a U.S.-led value proposition that competes with China's. We must show leadership and contribute strong financial support as it has only become more important to provide credible alternatives to lending options that can be opaque and coercive, potentially undermining borrower countries' sovereignty and long-term economic sustainability. Over the past year, we continued to push for evolution at the MDBs so that they are efficient, effective, and can better help countries address global challenges. Congress enabled a $250 million contribution to the World Bank's IDA Crisis Response Window, demonstrating U.S. commitment to providing a critical lifeline to the world's poorest and most vulnerable countries. We made the largest pledge to the replenishment of the International Fund for Agriculture and Development, a strong partner in increasing food security. We also helped lead successful negotiations around capital increases and important reforms for IDB Invest, the private sector arm of the Inter- American Development Bank, and a key partner in Latin America and the Caribbean, and for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to enhance its lending capacity, including for continued support of Ukraine. We now ask that Congress authorize our participation in these capital increases and in the African Development Bank's callable capital increase so that it can continue to lend at current levels to countries that otherwise would be forced to look elsewhere. The President's budget also requests $1 billion that would enable up to $36 billion in new lending capacity at the World Bank, as we continue to press international partners to join us in efforts that could expand lending headroom by $100 billion. I thank Congress for authorizing lending $21 billion to the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust, making us the largest contributor and further showcasing our strong commitment to supporting low-income countries. We also led successful negotiations on the 16th general quota review so that the IMF is adequately resourced to continue to play its crucial role at the center of the global financial safety net and to preserve our quota share and veto, solidifying U.S. influence at this vital institution. We request authorization to increase the U.S. quota to cement this significant achievement. Let me stop there. I would be happy to answer your questions.  Chairman McHenry. Thank you, Madam Secretary. I will now recognize myself for 5 minutes for questions. Let's start with the notice of proposed rulemaking on outbound investment. We have talked a good bit about this. As I said in my opening statement, I think what the Administration has done is a step in the right direction. I welcome it. But we have time-tested tools of sanctions that are clear red light/ green lights, what is permissible/what is not permissible. So we have a notice of proposed rulemaking, and there is a line established about, what are investments, investable technology that is prohibited versus a reporting regime, and it is not clear. So, just wanting to have one question as an example, the difference between artificial intelligence (AI) being used for an MRI in a medical setting to identify cancer, and by a drone operator using location targets' imaging to targets in a weapons setting--how do you draw the distinction between those two different AIs? Secretary Yellen. We recognize that, in artificial intelligence, it is widely used for many different purposes. And the regime that we have proposed is really oriented toward those uses that are clearly national security risks. We want to make sure that China and other countries of concern don't gain access to technologies and products that are critical for---- Chairman McHenry. Why not just name names and say, ``Don't invest in these companies?'' Isn't that the clearest route to stem the flow of capital going into Chinese technology? Let me give you another example. The regulation says that AI that operates at either the 10 to the 24th, 10 to the 25th, or 10 to the 26th computational operations would not be investable for Americans. What is the real-world difference between these operational levels and the significance of one being used in a military capability setting? Secretary Yellen. We have tried to target technologies that are critical and can contribute to military intelligence or cyber capabilities in countries of concern. We want to make sure that what we are doing here is narrowly targeted at clear national security risks---- Chairman McHenry. Why not just use sanctions for that? Why not just use direct sanctions that say, ``Do not invest in these companies?'' Red light/green light, there is no complete clarity here. Why not just go with that approach? Secretary Yellen. Sanctions usually are put in place after something has occurred that creates a problem, and these are very rapidly-evolving areas. We know that there is a gap in our regulatory framework, and we want to make sure that American firms and persons are not contributing, through their investment activities, to enabling firms in China or other countries of concern to---- Chairman McHenry. Yes. We are trying to get at the same thing. I am saying clearly that we have sanctions that we can proactively take on companies that are using this technology, and it is far clearer. And that is a far clearer way to stem the flow of U.S. investment capital into China. Let me switch to one additional topic, which is the beneficial ownership regime. As I said in my opening statement, we wanted clarity here. We didn't want redundancy. Why did the Treasury bifurcate the beneficial ownership rules and move forward without the third rule? And when can we expect Treasury to publish the customer due diligence (CDD) rescission rule? Right now, you have two reporting regimes on small businesses. This is onerous. What is the timeline to clear that up? Secretary Yellen. That is something that we are working on revising to make sure it is consistent with the requirements of the Corporate Transparency Act. I believe that we are hoping to get something out this fall. We are engaging right now with other stakeholder agencies to discuss the substance of the proposal, and we want to have a notice that will enable the public to weigh in with their own comments. Chairman McHenry. Okay. Well, right now, because of rules 1 and 2 going live, every small business in America has a new reporting requirement that they are most likely unaware of, and this needs to be cleared up. I will now recognize the ranking member of the committee, Ms. Waters, for 5 minutes. Ms. Waters. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Yellen, I don't have much of a question to ask you. I want to thank you basically for the work that you have done. There is a lot of talk about in helping small businesses and minority businesses, but under your leadership, working with the President of the United States, you have done a magnificent job. I want to thank you for the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), an alternative to the big banks who don't give loans to small businesses; they don't want them in the bank. But because of CDFIs, people have a place to go to present their case and get loans. The other thing I want to thank you for is the Minority Business Development Agency, which you put $125 million into in order to teach and to train and to make sure that small businesses have the assistance that they need, the technical assistance to these businesses so that they have the legal, the accounting, and business advice that they need to grow and prosper. And, of course, I want to thank you for the SSBCI. We put in this committee $10 billion to create 10 million loans, and I want you to know that it is making a difference. I want you to know that the other side has not done any significant work for small and minority-owned businesses. We are trying to close the wealth gap. I give you credit for your leadership, and for your understanding. If I wanted to ask you a question, I would ask you, do you think that these kinds of efforts will help us to close that wealth gap? Secretary Yellen. I absolutely do, and I very much want to thank you for the strong endorsement that you have given Treasury's work. I know how important this is to you, and it is important to the country. It has been our focus to use the funds that Congress has provided most effectively since day one of the Biden Administration. And addressing the wealth gap is a top priority. At Treasury, we are trying to use every single tool that we have to make headway on this. As you know, this is something that is difficult to eradicate, but I think our efforts are making a difference. And, as I have traveled around the country, I have often had the chance to visit businesses that are getting help from CDFIs in low-income or minority communities. And I have seen small businesses get the support they need through CDFIs or through SSBCI to develop and thrive. This is a clear focus of all the work the Biden Administration has done. Ms. Waters. I think it is important for people to know that this is all over the country. And I am trying to get my colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle to work with us so that rural communities and small communities and towns can have more access. The infrastructure is not there with nonprofits and others to work with what you are doing for all of us. And maybe, there is something you can say or do to encourage those who have small towns in their areas that don't know about the programs. And, when we take it to them to ask them, ``Don't you want to participate in CDFIs, and don't you want some of the money that comes to your States with SSBCI's?'' What can we do to get them more interested so that more of this money can get into rural communities? I know that you don't have time. This is not the proper place to educate them now. But perhaps you can volunteer to meet with some of my colleagues to get them interested from the opposite side of the aisle on how they can take advantage of what you are doing, what the President is doing, and what we are learning so we can help equal the playing field so that we can have financial services working for everybody, and that we can have women- and minority-owned businesses, et cetera, that have been excluded for so long, participating because of the work that you are doing. Secretary Yellen. Thank you very much. And we would be glad to work with you or with others who are interested in bringing these benefits to low-income and rural communities. We do try to do significant outreach, and we are certainly prepared to do more, and would welcome the collaboration. Ms. Waters. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Hill. . The gentlewoman's time has expired. I now recognize myself for 5 minutes. Madam Secretary, it is great to have you here before the committee. It has been more than 2 months since President Biden signed the REPO Act into law, and I would like to see it swiftly and fully implemented by the President. I wrote to you in May, joined by Congresswoman Waters and Congressman Meeks, to encourage the Administration to do that. And, while I support doing all we can to help Ukraine eject Putin, I have several concerns about the extraordinary revenue acceleration loan package announced by the G7 leaders last month. I question whether this plan can really work in practice. Under the REPO Act, the President already has the authority to go after Russian sovereign assets in the United States, and I believe these frozen assets should be legally seized, the ownership converted, and those funds deposited in the REPO contemplated trust fund. I think that is in the best interests of Ukraine, the U.S., and our G7 allies. And I think it sends the right message that we are leading. Congress, on a bipartisan basis, passed this law. We want tough sanctions. We want Ukraine to have the arms they need. And we need the financial deterrence that the REPO Act brings. As Margaret Thatcher told us years ago, ``This is no time to go wobbly.'' I would like to know how we are implementing that law. Will you commit to meet the mandatory deadlines as required by Section 104 of the REPO Act, starting July 23rd? Secretary Yellen. We will meet the requirements of the Act, but let me say we were very pleased with the passage of the REPO Act. It provides Treasury and the Administration with an important set of tools, and we think all options should be on the table. However, we also believe the strength of our response to Putin has been that we have a global alliance that has worked together in support of Ukraine, and we have looked for an approach that our allies, particularly the G7 and the European Union, could be supportive of, that would deliver significant revenues to Ukraine. And, as I think you know, the G7 leaders in June did---- Mr. Hill. I do know, Madam Secretary. Let me reclaim my time just to use it effectively. And I thank you for your leadership, but the REPO Act, as Mr. Meeks and Ms. Waters and I point out, does give more strength. We should be leading and use that full tool, because we know the support is there in Europe if we will provide that leadership. What is the total amount, now that you have had this 2 months, of frozen Russian Central Bank assets held in the Federal Reserve here in the United States? Secretary Yellen. It is a relatively small amount. Mr. Hill. I understand that. Could you give us the amount, please, ma'am? Secretary Yellen. It is on the order of $5 billion or $6 billion. And most of the assets are held in Europe. Mr. Hill. I understand that. I understand where the assets are held. Thank you. Let me switch subjects to the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21). I want to thank you, and I want to thank Under Secretary Liang for the work you did on looking at our digital assets regulatory framework, which we worked on mightily over the last year, on a bipartisan basis. I particularly want to thank the White House for the Statement of Administration Policy, which says that you are eager to work with Congress on developing legislation for digital assets to ensure a comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework. Do you continue to commit for the balance of this Congress to work with the committee and in the Senate to achieve a regulatory framework for digital assets? Secretary Yellen. Yes, very much so. I am happy to make that commitment, and we have worked productively together. It would be nice to see this reach a good conclusion. Mr. Hill. On another topic related to digital assets, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are consistently taking opposite legal positions in Federal court on digital assets. In your capacity as the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) leader, what are you doing to bring the CFTC and the SEC together and be on the same page about this matter? Secretary Yellen. It is not the job of the Financial Stability Oversight Council to adjudicate---- Mr. Hill. No, but you are supposed to quarterback for financial risk. Are you quarterbacking between the CFTC and the SEC on this dispute? Secretary Yellen. Not really. We have done a report on the risks connected with cryptocurrency and digital assets. Mr. Hill. Okay. In my final---- Secretary Yellen. The risks have to do with holes where there is a lack of authority. Mr. Hill. Right. I agree. And you are working constructively with us. Thank you. I am going to submit some questions in writing for the record on the multilateral banks and what I think is a preference that China is seeking, and we need Treasury to push back on that. My time has expired. I recognize the gentlewoman from New York, Ms. Velazquez, for 5 minutes. Ms. Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, welcome, Secretary Yellen. Thank you for being here this morning. As you know, many working-class families and small businesses are concerned about inflation. You recently told Yahoo Finance that you expect inflation to come down, and, as we get into next year, you believe inflation will get back to the 2-percent target, and you do not see the basis for a U.S. recession. Can you explain how the policies of the Biden-Harris Administration have helped temper the rate of inflation and given you this sense of optimism? Secretary Yellen. I am optimistic, because I believe that the big inflationary impulse that we saw in 2022 largely was global, and it largely reflected supply problems stemming from the pandemic and its impact around the world. And, due to the work of the Biden Administration, and firms in the economy, and the pandemic being resolved, many of those supply issues are now fully resolved. So, much of the pressure has diminished. On top of that, we have a strong labor market that has attracted many new people into the labor market. Labor supply has surged. And, although the labor market was initially very tight, now we have a strong labor market, but one with fewer pressures that would create inflationary concern. Inflation is coming down. The measure the Fed focuses on is now running at 2.6 percent over the last year, and I believe that it will continue to come down over time. Rents and housing costs continue to be higher than we would ideally like. Ms. Velazquez. Yes. Secretary Yellen. And it will be a while before housing costs come down to a more normal level, but that process is in---- Ms. Velazquez. Thank you. Madam Secretary, in his opening statement, Chairman McHenry mentioned the IMF's warning about the U.S. debt burden. However, in the same Yahoo Finance interview, you were also critical of the tax cuts passed by Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans, saying that decision was responsible for many of the problems that we face now with our fiscal trajectory. Can you explain the fiscal problems that arose from Donald Trump's tax cuts and how the Biden Administration is working to reduce these effects? Secretary Yellen. It was a tax cut that had a very large impact on the deficit and the national debt. It was costly. It was regressive. It did not pay for itself. And, in a way, it concealed its true cost by including delayed raisers, phaseouts, and sunsets, some of which Congress will have to deal with next year. We did not see the investment boom that was promised by the Act. And President Biden believes it is important to be on a fiscally-sustainable path. Ms. Velazquez. Thank you. I hope the other side is listening. Secretary Yellen, millions of businesses are required to report their beneficial ownership information to FinCEN by January 1st. Yet, according to several conversations I am having with businesses in my district and across the country, many legitimate businesses are unaware that this requirement exists. How are FinCEN and the Treasury Department working to increase awareness of this requirement, particularly amongst rural and underserved businesses in which English is not a primary language? Secretary Yellen. FinCEN has a very active program of outreach and of education, and I believe that you participated--and I want to thank you for that--by hosting an event designed to inform people and business owners about what the requirements entail. There is other language to support---- Ms. Velazquez. If I could just make a suggestion? I would like to see better coordination--Mr. Chairman, please give me just a second--to work closely with the Small Business Administration (SBA). We have a network of Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs) across the country---- Mr. Hill. The gentlewoman's time has expired. Secretary Yellen. I will do that. Ms. Velazquez. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Hill. The gentleman from South Carolina, Mr. Norman, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Norman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Secretary Yellen, for being here today. I think the Chair mentioned beneficial ownership. How is your office going about educating the 32.6 million businesses that have never heard of FinCEN? You have a penalty of a quarter of a million dollars plus 2 years imprisonment on something that has been ruled unconstitutional by a court in Alabama. What are you doing to: one, inform the businesses who are the lynchpin for this economy; and two, is there any thought to extending the 12-month deadline to another year, to 2 years? Secretary Yellen. As I mentioned, there is an extensive outreach and education program that is taking place across the country. People with FinCEN are hosting events. And we are happy to work with Members of Congress to explain what this is about in different parts of the country. So, if you have an interest in that, please just contact us. But there is an extensive outreach effort. It is a very simple process; it takes 15 or 20 minutes, I believe, for most firms to be able to file. There is a very user-friendly website where the information can be input. It is not a difficult process. We have seen a good response so far and I don't think it is going to be necessary to extend the timeframe. It goes through the end of this year. Mr. Norman. What are the numbers that have already complied, in your opinion? Secretary Yellen. I believe 2.7 million is the most recent number. Mr. Norman. 2.7 million out of 31 million. That is kind of a low percentage. Now, if the penalty is going to stay in place--you say this is simple. But, for the businesses, these businesses are struggling. They are just trying to make ends meet with this Biden Administration, what they are doing with inflation, what they are doing with the supply chain, all of the above. And to put another regulation on them at this point in time and not know--put me on your list for what FinCEN is doing. Secretary Yellen. Okay. Mr. Norman. Your average plumber is not going to go on a website and try to find out how to comply with the beneficial ownership. So, if you could supply--and I will send you a letter after this, if you could comply and consider extending it. A quarter of a million dollars fine is ridiculous. Secretary Yellen. The fine is for, ``willful violation,'' as I understand---- Mr. Norman. Define, ``willful violation?'' Secretary Yellen. ----the rules. And your plumber example is not somebody who is willfully violating the rules. FinCEN is not going to prioritize going after small businesses who are unaware---- Mr. Norman. Secretary Yellen, you realize that is in the print? You realize the fine is printed? Secretary Yellen. For, ``willful.'' Mr. Norman. How do you define, ``willful?'' Secretary Yellen. Someone who knows they have an obligation and fails to---- Mr. Norman. Does that apply to the plumber who doesn't know what FinCEN is? In the example I used, does that contractor, that plumber, that welder, if he has a business, is it willful if he just doesn't comply? Secretary Yellen. There is a massive education and outreach effort. And personally, I wouldn't regard that as willful. Mr. Norman. Okay. Well, if you could clarify that in writing, not just verbally, I think that would mean a whole lot. Now, on another subject, I am in South Carolina. The Chinese are buying up farmland all over this country. What is the role of the Secretary of Agriculture, and what is your role in, I guess, allowing this to take place, if any? Secretary Yellen. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has the ability to ban land purchases or, in some cases, even insist on divestiture of activities taking place---- Mr. Norman. Are they doing that now? Define how they ban it. It is taking place now. They are doing it through separate entities, LLCs. I only have 12 seconds, so I will write you a letter, if you could define for me what, ``banning,'' means and how specifically you stop this. Secretary Yellen. We work closely with the Defense Department. This is national security-oriented. And yesterday, we issued a new proposed rule that adds 50 additional military bases to the existing ones and changes some of the perimeters of some of them. Mr. Hill. The gentleman's time has expired. Secretary Yellen. It follows a thorough Department of Defense review. Mr. Hill. The gentleman's time has expired. The gentleman from California, Mr. Sherman, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Sherman. Madam Secretary, I want to commend you and the entire Biden economic team. Over the last couple of years, we have seen the greatest decline in the inflation rate at any time this century, and at the same time, we have kept unemployment at historically-low levels. I want to thank you and the entire team for that effort. I also want to compliment you for the Direct File system that has allowed millions of taxpayers to be able to file their tax returns in an electronic form without paying $130 to Turbo Tax. To quote your good words before the Senate, you said that one day, information that taxpayers receive on the W-2 forms and the 1099s could be used to prepopulate the program, and I look forward to the day when the majority of Americans can file their tax return in less than 2 minutes simply by seeing the W- 2 form and the 1099 information. They have already achieved that in about a dozen countries in Europe. The gentleman from Arkansas mentioned the REPO Act. Those assets should be used to go to Ukraine, but there are Americans who have claims against those assets, judgments against those assets, and I would hope that we wouldn't send all of the money to Ukraine, and then tell the Americans with claims that they are out of luck. The anti-money laundering laws are important. I want to bring to your attention that Florida, and now Tennessee, have laws designed to--and it is perhaps a good purpose of these laws--say that you shouldn't be denied financial services because of your political opinions or religious beliefs. But I hope that you will work with those States and preempt those laws as necessary to protect the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). We shouldn't be in a circumstance where you lose your account because you have all of these suspicious activity reports (SARs), and the bank can't tell you about the suspicious activity reports, and all of a sudden you think it is because of your political beliefs. In the past, when you have come here, I have talked to you about how China has incentives for its domestic taxpayers to invest in Chinese companies but denies those for investments in the United States, but we have incentives for Americans to invest--we call it capital gains allowance--and we provide it to those who invest in China. But I want to focus instead on India. India has cut its corporate tax rate from 40 percent to 22 percent, but they have excluded branches of foreign companies. So many U.S. companies can just form a subsidiary and take advantage of that 22- percent rate, but American financial institutions have branches, and as a technical matter, they can't form a subsidiary. Can I count you on you to bring this up with the Indian Ministry of Finance, that American companies should have the same tax rate as Indian companies in India? Secretary Yellen. I would be glad to have my staff discuss this with you in greater detail to understand the issue. Mr. Sherman. I look forward to that. I want to commend you for sanctioning individuals who use sexual violence as a weapon of war in Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and South Sudan. But the greatest use of sexual violence in war this century is the 100,000 Tigrayan women who have been subjected to sexual violence in northern Ethiopia. Can you commit to applying the same standards that you did for Sudan, the DRC, and South Sudan to individuals, particularly in the Ethiopian and Eritrean military, who have carried out this campaign of sexual violence against Tigrayan women? Can I count on you to use the same standards? Secretary Yellen. This is really a determination that has to be made by the State Department rather than Treasury. But certainly, human rights violations have been a concern. Mr. Sherman. And finally, the Russian Central Bank has urged the use of crypto to evade Western sanctions. A stablecoin offers no particular advantage in that it is stable. You can't make money by holding it, and it usually doesn't pay interest, certainly not the interest you get on money market funds. Its sole advantage is evading our sanctions and other laws, including tax laws. And I hope that in enforcing our sanctions on Russia, you will not facilitate that by facilitating a stablecoin. Secretary Yellen. We are very attentive to the use of crypto currencies and stablecoins. We don't think it is a very substantial thing that Russia is doing. But, as our sanctions bite more and more, it becomes a concern. Mr. Hill. The gentleman's time has expired. The gentleman from New York, Mr. Garbarino, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Garbarino. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Madam Secretary, for being here today. Back in September, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) announced that it is considering a Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) SBREFA that includes a broad and novel definition of, ``data broker.'' Secretary Yellen. Of what? Mr. Garbarino. As I mentioned to CFPB Director Chopra, I am very concerned that this proposal may not recognize how consumer data is used for identity verification and fraud prevention. Use of data for these purposes is not the same as using it for credit eligibility purposes and, therefore, shouldn't be subject to the FCRA. Further, the companies that provide identity and fraud- prevention technology to financial institutions should not be regulated under the FCRA, as they already fall under the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. It would be a serious mistake to limit our fraud- prevention tools in the system. Secretary Yellen, given that the CFPB's proposal may severely impact the ability to prevent fraud and conduct identify verification, has the CFPB spoken to anyone at FinCEN or Treasury regarding its SBREFA proposal? Secretary Yellen. I would have to ask. I don't know what contact there has been. I have not talked to Director Chopra about this, but my staff may well have done so. Mr. Garbarino. If they haven't, will you commit to engaging with the CFPB on this? Secretary Yellen. Certainly. I would be happy to look into it. Mr. Garbarino. Okay. Wouldn't it make sense for the CFPB to minimize its impact on the Bank Secrecy Act compliance and other law enforcement and privacy statutes? Secretary Yellen. If it has that impact, it would make sense. Mr. Garbarino. Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you very much. Over the last 2 decades, China has unleashed a global lending spree, mainly through its Belt and Road Initiative, showering mostly developing countries with hundreds of billions of dollars in an effort to expand its influence and become a political and economic superpower. China has opaque loans, different from most other loans to developing countries by advanced nations or institutions like the World Bank, that usually carry higher interest rates and shorter maturities, requiring financing every couple of years and frequently using national assets as collateral. As more countries are on the cusp of default, rising interest rates are only going to make it more expensive to pay off debt denominated in dollars and other key currencies. Secretary, what should the role of international financial institutions be in addressing the needs of those that have outstanding Chinese debt and are currently in desperate need of relief from Beijing? Secretary Yellen. We are working extremely hard to relieve the debt burdens of low-income countries that clearly need to restructure their debt and are trying to do so in the context of an IMF program. And, as you say, China is often the holdout and the most difficult lender to deal with, and we have been addressing that in all that we do. It is a topic I have raised in all of my bilateral meetings with my Chinese counterparts. We have raised this with the IMF and the World Bank. A sovereign debt roundtable has been created to deal with some of the issues that China continues to raise in multiple debt restructurings. And while I still have serious concerns, some progress has been made in the context of Common Framework debt restructurings. Zambia and Ghana, for example, are countries where progress has been made; China has come to the table. But there is clearly more to do. Mr. Garbarino. You have said that you have spoken with the World Bank and the IMF about this. Estimates peg China's lending to the developing world at a trillion dollars, which makes them a bigger lender than the World Bank and the IMF, but China is still considered an emerging and developing economy under the eyes of the IMF. Do you believe that the U.S. should now use its influence in international organizations to change China's status as a developing country specifically at the IMF? Secretary Yellen. I guess I need to look at that. I am not prepared to give you an answer on that. Mr. Garbarino. Again, it is my understanding that the IMF considers China an emerging and developing economy, which allows them better terms under certain loans. And, if they are giving out a trillion dollars a year to other countries, I think we should look at it. Secretary Yellen. We oppose, in the World Bank and all of the MDBs, any lending to China whatsoever given China's income level and extensive lending around the world. And we have pushed, and they have reduced very substantially the lending that they do. We vote against all of it. Mr. Garbarino. Thank you. I just to want say this: International banks play an important role in our nation's economy, particularly in New York. I recognize that the Basel III Endgame is not in your current jurisdiction, but the financial impact of these rules cannot be understated. I would encourage you, as Treasury Secretary, to talk with banking regulators and other FSOC members about the impact of this rule. Mr. Hill. The gentleman's time has expired. The gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Scott, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Yellen, you remember the last time you were here, I raised concerns about the balloon going over the United States by China and how concerning that was, and since that time, this issue of national security and agriculture is going hand in hand. Our farm bill--my good friend, Chairman Thompson, and I, as two leaders on the House Agriculture Committee, have framed this as a national security issue. And here's why: The FBI has now labeled the Chinese Government's action as the greatest threat. FBI Director Christopher Wray warned us in April that, ``Chinese hackers have infiltrated U.S. critical military infrastructures and are now poised to cause significant damage at any given moment's notice.'' So, we have a national security issue here of soaring magnitude, and we are working in a bipartisan way, obviously, to solve this problem. I want to ask you some specific questions here. Under your proposal going forward, you now have more than 50 new facilities that will be added to the lists of sites where surrounding property transactions may be reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and now is totaling 227. So, I want to thank you. You all are moving. Secretary Yellen. We are. Mr. Scott. And this has to be our number-one national security issue, largely because it is a delicate dance. Many people don't know--we do know China is our greatest threat, but it is also our greatest and largest trading partner. So, it is a very delicate dance that we have to do. Now, tell me, how did you ultimately decide which military bases would be included in this latest expansion? Secretary Yellen. We worked very closely with the Department of Defense in issuing the notice of proposed rulemaking that came out yesterday, and they undertook a comprehensive assessment of military installations and considered a number of factors--operations, assets, missions, training at each installation, and what was appropriate in terms of coverage under CFIUS---- Mr. Scott. Pardon me. I want to get to a couple more questions. My understanding is that three or more military installations were removed from that list. Secretary Yellen. Congressman, my understanding is that nothing is actually removed from the list, but when areas were expanded or new bases were added to the list, some existing bases may have fallen within the radius of another base that either was expanded or added. I don't think that there were any bases that were actually removed. Mr. Scott. Okay. Now, let me ask you this. To the best of your knowledge, is there any indication that the Chinese Government is looking beyond land purchases and farm land and expanding into buying other types of small businesses around military bases? I also want to thank you for working with my staff on this issue, and I hope that we continue to work together, because it is now the number-one issue facing us as far as agriculture is concerned, and now, as far as the national security of our nation. Secretary Yellen. I can get back to you on whether or not we are looking at small businesses, but---- Mr. Scott. Thank you. Secretary Yellen. ----I believe that would be within the scope of CFIUS's---- Mr. Scott. I look forward to working with you on that. Mr. Luetkemeyer. . The gentleman's time has expired. I now recognize the gentlewoman from California, Mrs. Kim, for 5 minutes. Mrs. Kim. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Yellen, thank you for joining us today. As you know, the House unanimously passed my bill, H.R. 540, the Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act. This will support Taiwan's membership at the IMF where statehood is not a prerequisite to join the international organizations, and the IMF has no conditions where statehood is not a requirement. And as you know, Taiwan belongs to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Asian Development Bank. So if Taiwan seeks its membership at the IMF, would you support it? Secretary Yellen. Taiwan has not expressed any interest in joining the IMF. This is not a decision that the United States Government---- Mrs. Kim. With all due respect, Secretary Yellen, that is why we passed the Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act, and we are hoping that you will work with us and fully support Taiwan's membership in the IMF. And obviously, it goes without saying that the world would benefit from having the input and expertise of the world's 21st-largest economy. So, I hope you will work with us, and the legislation has already passed out of the House. Secretary Yellen. Sure. I guess what I can say is that we have supported greater engagement between the IMF and Taiwan, even with Taiwan being a nonmember. Mrs. Kim. Thank you. Secretary Yellen. We have urged surveillance activities---- Mrs. Kim. Yes. Secretary Yellen. ----and other IMF activities to work with Taiwan to include them. Mrs. Kim. Taiwan has indicated their expressed interest to join, so when that happens, I hope you will support that. Let me move on to my next question. This is something that I know Representative Garbarino mentioned earlier, so I echo his comments to address the growing problem of indebtedness of low-income countries. G20 nations and the Paris Club agreed to the Common Framework with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Can you speak of any of your efforts to force the CCP to make its sovereign lending more transparent through the Common Framework? Secretary Yellen. We have engaged thoroughly over a long period of time, and deeply, in every way we can, with China to bring them to the table to participate actively in restructuring through the Common Framework. It has been frustrating, but I think that there has been some progress. We have urged the IMF and the World Bank--they have set up a sovereign debt roundtable, which is a forum to discuss issues that China routinely raises that aren't really case-specific, but broader. Mrs. Kim. Thank you. Secretary Yellen. And I think we have made some progress there. Mrs. Kim. Thank you. Secretary Yellen. And there are several countries where we have achieved---- Mrs. Kim. Thank you, Secretary. Let's continue to be more vigilant in making sure that with like-minded countries, and with our allies, we can force the CCP to be more transparent. I am going to move on to the next question. We cannot afford to cave in to CCP demands that private creditors should be ignored in debt restructuring negotiations. There should be comparable treatment between public and private creditors. As you know, private capital is a powerful tool to counter the CCP's debt diplomacy. Earlier this year, the U.S. and the CCP launched a bilateral U.S.-PRC Counternarcotics Working Group to counter the manufacturing and trafficking of all illicit synthetic drugs, but I am afraid that we are giving away some of our leverage by lifting some sanctions, and once again, we are yielding to the empty promises made by CCP officials. Can you tell us about the role of Treasury and your role in the Working Group? Secretary Yellen. We participate in the Counternarcotics Working Group. And Treasury has also--under the auspices of a financial working group, we have established, with our counterparts led by the People's Bank of China, an anti-money laundering forum where we are working on best practices, which also relates to counternarcotics. We have seen China take some action against firms that are involved in producing precursor-- -- Mrs. Kim. I know late last year, when Xi Jinping and President Biden met, they also started the fentanyl working group and the narcotics working group early this year. But we know from experience that we cannot solely rely on commitments made by Xi Jinping and CCP officials. So, I hope that you will do more to ensure that the CCP abides by the commitments that are established by the Working Group. I know you are participating, but please be more firm. Secretary Yellen. Yes. And we have taken sanctions actions ourselves against Chinese firms on this. Mrs. Kim. Thank you. My time is up. I yield back. Mr. Luetkemeyer. The gentlelady yields back. With that, we go to the gentlelady from Ohio, Mrs. Beatty, for 5 minutes. Mrs. Beatty. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Ranking Member Waters. Secretary Yellen, I would just like to make a quick comment about FinCEN's beneficial ownership reporting rule, which has been discussed by many of my colleagues this morning. I know you are collecting the data to protect our national security and our financial system, and you are doing it because Congress actually mandated it in the Corporate Transparency Act. However, I, too, am concerned that many of our small businesses don't know about this new requirement, but I am going to do my part to spread the word and to educate the business owners in my district. As a matter of fact, I am excited about hosting Treasury Under Secretary Nelson and FinCEN Director Gacki in Columbus next week for our FinCEN small business information test. We may want to get a little quote from you in light of your words today to help relax some of them that this is not an attack on them. Secretary Yellen. Thank you for participating in this. It is much appreciated. And we want them to know about it, but we are not looking to penalize small businesses that learn about it and take the actions they need to file. Mrs. Beatty. Okay. Well, thank you for that. We will certainly, in my opening remarks, include that and share that with the businesses, because we found out that many of them absolutely have no idea about this reporting. Secretary Yellen. Right. Mrs. Beatty. But the good news is there were some who not only knew about it; they had actually completed their transparency forms. So, we are going to continue---- Secretary Yellen. It is pretty simple, filing for a small business. Mrs. Beatty. Thank you. Let me now go to the first question I have. Secretary Yellen, the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA), as you know, is undergoing a replenishment this year. As the largest single provider of development finance to the poorest countries, the IDA is essential to addressing the most critical development challenges and setting high standards across the field. What role does IDA play in addressing the critical challenges caused by climate change in developing countries, and how is Treasury pushing IDA to advance its development priorities for the next 3 years? Secretary Yellen. It plays an absolutely critical role in providing concessional demands to the poorest countries, and it addresses a wide range of needs from food insecurity to education, to climate, to pandemic preparedness, and other things. We look forward to an ambitious IDA21 refinancing, and we want to make sure that the funds are used effectively, given the enormous pressures that these countries are under, given all that has happened in terms of climate change, and also, in terms of pressures on food and energy prices. Mrs. Beatty. Okay. Thank you. Secretary Yellen, under President Trump, the United States became more isolationist as it exited the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and engaged in close contact with dictators. How has the United States Treasury, under the Biden Administration, helped restore and reassert U.S. leadership in the global economy? Secretary Yellen. Thank you. Since day one, it has been a priority at Treasury for us to work closely and collaboratively with other countries around the globe to address common problems, whether it is food insecurity, development aid for countries so that they can grow, addressing debt problems, or addressing pandemic preparedness. We have worked closely on trying to set a floor on corporate income tax rates globally to stop what has been a decades-long race to the bottom. And certainly when it comes to our support of Ukraine, the United States has shown global leadership, and we have worked very closely with our global colleagues on support for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. So, a wide range of things that is just a very partial list, and we really try to turn the clock 180 degrees in terms of cooperation and involvement in international fora. Mrs. Beatty. Thank you. And my time is up. Mr. Luetkemeyer. The gentlelady's time has expired. The gentleman from Nebraska, Mr. Flood, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Flood. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Madam Secretary, for being here today. Before I begin, I want to make a brief statement on something that is admittedly not within the scope of this particular hearing but is very important to my district and agriculture producers across the country. With the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit going into effect in less than 5 months, Nebraska's agriculture and energy producers need full and accurate guidance promptly. I was disappointed to see Treasury release guidance in April for the 40B Sustainable Aviation Fuel Credit that rejected the best available scientific data and tied the hands of our nation's agricultural producers with an unworkable, one- size-fits-all limitation. Nebraska's farmers don't need the Federal Government to come in at the eleventh hour and dictate which practices are acceptable and not acceptable. And I will continue to advocate for greater flexibility that fully recognizes the role Nebraska's producers play in the future of transportation fuels and for an all-of-the-above energy policy that puts our farmers first. I plan to submit some questions, Madam Secretary, for the record on this issue, and I would appreciate a quick response. Switching gears, Secretary Yellen, in response to a letter from Chairman McHenry, among others, regarding FSOC's calls to fill the spot market gap in digital assets, it was noted that, ``crypto asset platforms engage in practices commonly subjected to greater regulation, including operating order book style markets and custody crypto customer assets.'' Those activities sound a lot like activities undertaken by centralized intermediaries, and centralized intermediaries are undoubtedly an important piece of the regulatory puzzle for digital asset regulation. That is why this committee and the Agriculture Committee collaborated together on the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act, which provides a new regulatory framework with sufficient responsibility and resources for the CFTC to effectively regulate spot markets for digital assets that are not securities. However, I think it is important that we think about some of the unique characteristics in decentralized systems as well. These protocols will allow willing buyers and willing sellers to find one another and make a trade based on the rules of the protocol to any of the market participants. Here is my question: What do you think about decentralized trading protocols that do not create order book style markets or involve the custody of customer's crypto assets? Wouldn't these markets, which are unique relative to most of our understanding of traditional centralized markets, require a different approach to regulation? Secretary Yellen. You are talking about decentralized finance (DeFi) type of activities and---- Mr. Flood. We have to recognize there is going to be a decentralized angle to all of this in digital assets, and so far, everything seems very centralized, so yes. Secretary Yellen. And your question is, what about the regulatory approach to those markets? Mr. Flood. When you look at this whole regulatory regime, how do you think about decentralized trading protocols basically that do not create order book style markets, or involve the custody of a customer's crypto assets? Have you given that a lot of thought? Secretary Yellen. This is certainly something that the regulators are looking at, the SEC, and, to some extent, the CFTC. Perhaps, some of these activities may fall under the regulatory umbrella of the banking agencies as well and---- Mr. Flood. And I would add this, Madam Secretary. FSOC released a report in late 2023 which dedicated an entire section to the risks associated with digital assets. One such risk the report mentioned was, ``concentrated risk.'' I would like to focus on a couple of aspects of concentration risk on which I would like your views. If there are only a small number of entities that are able to serve as custodians of digital assets for registered investment advisors, would you agree that such an arrangement could constitute a concentration risk? Secretary Yellen. It could potentially, but I would need to know more about the details. Mr. Flood. I will note that a witness representing the registered investment advisors spoke in front of Our Digital Assets Subcommittee early last year and testified that his firm had, ``three, maybe four,'' options for digital assets custody currently, and indicated the number could reduce what the SEC's custody rulemaking. I guess, Madam Secretary, in the time I have left, if there are only a small number of entities that are able to serve as custodians of the now-approved spot Bitcoin's ETFs, would you view that arrangement as a potential concentration risk? Secretary Yellen. I just have to know more about the details. I would need to really look carefully at the case you have in mind. Mr. Flood. I will leave you with this: I emphasize that there are only a handful of custodians for spot Bitcoin ETFs, and most issuers only have one custodian. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. And thank you for your time. Mr. Luetkemeyer. The gentleman yields back. The gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Casten, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Casten. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Secretary, it is so nice to see you here again. I am grateful for your time today. I want to chat about this ongoing risk from climate change to our financial markets, and specifically to what is happening in insurance sectors. There has been a lot of reporting that I am sure you have seen--The New York Times said that homeowners' property insurance firms lost money in 18 States in 2023, so a third of our union---- Secretary Yellen. Yes. Mr. Casten. ----at least as far as the Senate counts things. In Texas, home insurance rates went up 23 percent in 2023. We have seen 15 companies that just left Florida after Hurricane Ida, and 12 insurers went totally insolvent after the hurricanes in 2021, and 20 in Louisiana. And I know we have had this conversation with you, and with your staff. Whether this presents a systemic risk to the G-SIBs is one question, but with over a third of Americans' wealth tied up in their homes, it is clearly disruptive. I am grateful for what the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) is doing to try to get the data. I have some concerns, though, that the data call from FIO is relying on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). And I have heard--I don't think this is public, but I have heard anecdotally and privately from folks whom I trust, that there are at least nine States that are not participating in that data call, and that those States tend to be ones that are most exposed to climate risk. So, my first question is, are you aware of those data gaps in the FIO data call, and what can FIO do to fill in those gaps to make sure we get a robust picture of where the financial risks are now? Secretary Yellen. I knew that a couple of States were not participating, but I thought it was the case that most of the States, where there are great concerns, are participating. I am happy to look into that in greater detail and get back to you. Mr. Casten. Okay. I don't know if that is public, but maybe we can share with staff what we are hearing, and we can just compare notes and see what we are seeing. Secretary Yellen. FIO and NAIC were able to collaborate, and we thought that was a better approach to trying to collect detailed, meaningful data that would give us insight into this problem. And so, that is the route we have taken. Mr. Casten. Okay. Secretary Yellen. We expect to learn a lot from this data collection. And as you say, it is potentially a very serious problem. Mr. Casten. Are you able to get--I don't know if you saw, there was a New York Times story today that referred to a National Bureau of Economic Research paper from last month, I think Keys and Mulder were the authors, but they essentially looked at insurance payments that are made and were able to subtract out public information on property tax and mortgages to get the inferred insurance that was paid as part of the escrow. Secretary Yellen. I'm sorry, I haven't seen that. Mr. Casten. Well, check out the New York Times today. It is fascinating, because it would seem to imply that there is a way to back into the data, at least as far as what is happening with---- Secretary Yellen. We infer it---- Mr. Casten. ----rates and where some of the exposures are, and we can get wonkier here than our time will allow, but it seemed to suggest that there is a real dichotomy between States that have a very pro-consumer regulatory structure, that therefore are not keeping rates high enough to attract business, and States that have a very pro-insurer regulatory structure that are letting antitrust issues run amuck and driving rates up. And meanwhile---- Secretary Yellen. The State regulatory regime, I think, definitely matters to what is happening in individual States. Mr. Casten. Sometimes, 5 minutes bothers me. We should have longer conversations. The concern I have is that insurance is going to be this canary in the coal mine, except it is more like a gorilla in a very small closet, I guess. It is all regulated at the State level. In theory, we have FIO. In theory, I think this committee has jurisdiction over insurance generally, whatever that means. But it just feels like this huge Whack-A-Mole when we are trying to get data. And I am curious if you think that you or FIO, or maybe more broadly, FSOC--do you have the authority just to go and ask the right questions so that we can understand where these risks are pooling, or do we need to find other workarounds, maybe even more regulatory fixes? Secretary Yellen. FIO has looked very carefully at this and considered whether the collaboration with the insurance commissioners was an adequate way to collect this data, and on balance felt this was the best approach, and that we would collect information that would be very useful and provide a lot of insights. As you know, this is normally a State matter, and not a Federal matter, but there have been increasing calls. And given what is happening, I think the Federal Government should be looking very carefully at this, not just to provide information, but because there may be a call for Federal action. Mr. Casten. Yes, exactly. And I see where the risk is pooling. I am out of time, so I yield back. Thank you very much. Mr. Luetkemeyer. The gentleman yields back. The gentleman from Iowa, Mr. Nunn, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Nunn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Madam Secretary, for being with us today. I want to highlight--I think we all agree that national security is at the top of the list, certainly at Treasury and here in Congress as well, and national security means standing up to Russia, China, and Iran. It is not about overly burdening small businesses in my home State of Iowa. So, let's get started today. I want to thank Secretary Yellen. My home State has 270,000 small businesses. In fact, it makes up 99 percent of our business in Iowa. And they are facing a tremendous amount of paperwork coming largely from Treasury, which is why we invited FinCEN Director Gacki to come out and hear directly from Iowans, and she did a great job, but she also got an earful. She heard and admitted that FinCEN has alerted only 2 million of more than 3.2 million small businesses of their obligation to fill out beneficial ownership information. That is an abysmal number, particularly when we have less than 6 months left in your timeline to help be able to execute. So here is my ask today, Madam Secretary: Would you support our bipartisan Small Business Red Tape Relief Act, which would extend the deadline for small businesses to be able to be compliant with Treasury? Secretary Yellen. FinCEN has 2.7 million reports so far, and they are engaging in a very extensive outreach and education effort. And it is their judgment that it is not necessary to extend the deadline, but---- Mr. Nunn. Madam Secretary, I appreciate that. Let me share with you what was delivered directly to Ms. Gacki. The very fact that we have only alerted 2 million out of more than 30 million is harmful. If they fail to meet it in the next 6 months, it will be $500-a-day to small businesses. We are not going after the bad guys; we are going after small businesses in Iowa. I would ask you, as the Treasury, to extend this deadline and work on a bipartisan level with us to make sure that our small businesses are taken care of. I hope you hear me on that. Secretary Yellen. Look, we are not trying to go after small businesses that do their best to meet their responsibilities, I think because they don't---- Mr. Nunn. Most of them don't know what their responsibilities are because they have not been informed by FinCEN at this point. Secretary Yellen. The CTA penalizes willful violations of the law, and we are not looking to take some sort of, ``gotcha,'' enforcement actions against small businesses that are doing their best. Mr. Nunn. I certainly hope that is the case, because my folks back home see a $500-per-day fine as not only, ``gotcha,'' but as a very painful impact. In that vein of setting deadlines, one of the things I would ask is, will Treasury be able to meet their November 1, 2024, rulemaking deadline on 45Z, the Clean Fuel Production Credit? Secretary Yellen. This is the successor to the Sustainable Fuels. Mr. Nunn. That is correct. Secretary Yellen. That is something that Treasury is working on but I can't give you an exact--there are many---- Mr. Nunn. I hope you meet your deadline, Madam Secretary, because you have laid out a very strict $500-a-day deadline for small businesses in Iowa that work largely in renewable fuels. I hope that Treasury can meet its own deadline that you have laid out of November 1st. I would like to change briefly now to Iranian illicit oil sales. I think we have all seen the threat in the Middle East, what it has done for Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Americans have died; Americans are still in the firing line; Treasury is the lead for sanctions. Can you tell us today, are there any U.S.-based firms providing insurance to Iran's illicit ghost fleet of oil tanker ships? Secretary Yellen. I can't speak to particular entities. What I can say is that we are working to crack down---- Mr. Nunn. Let me give you what the New York Times has, Madam Secretary, which is a list of 27 tankers currently supporting the illicit sale of oil from Iran to some of our worst adversaries. General Michael Kurilla of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) noted that Iran continues to sell 90 percent of its oil directly to China and fund a terrorist war in his area of responsibility (AOR) as a result of this. I have asked 5 times now for Treasury to be able to find a list, both in the classified and unclassified versions, of how we are cracking down on insurance violators here in the United States. Are we going to be able to do anything, or are you going to be able to have an answer for us on the insurance companies here domestically based that are providing insurance to a terrorist regime? Secretary Yellen. Most of the insurance companies that I am aware of that do this are outside the United States. Mr. Nunn. But there are some here in the United States, you would agree? Secretary Yellen. I am not able to comment on specifics of investigations that we are doing. Mr. Nunn. I would like a follow-up. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Mr. Luetkemeyer. The gentleman's time has expired. With that, we go to the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Gottheimer, for 5 minutes. Mr. Gottheimer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Yellen, the average price of childcare in this country is now higher than the average cost of rent. In my home State of New Jersey, the average family pays more than $440-a- week in childcare costs. What forms of tax relief are available for hardworking families struggling with these high costs, and what is the Biden Administration doing to combat the effects of these rising costs, please? Secretary Yellen. We certainly have proposed extending the Child Tax Credit, which was immensely helpful, and we are supportive of the legislation that has gone through the House, and would urge action in the Senate that would extend the Child Tax Credit along with other provisions. Mr. Gottheimer. Thank you. And I think it would be great if we could actually get that passed. It would lift 400,000 children above the poverty line. Switching gears a little bit following on the questions that were just asked, I applaud your recent decision to impose additional sanctions on a shadow banking network that has enabled Iran to fund proxy terrorist groups, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and Houthis. Holding Iran accountable has been a top priority for me, and for many of us, which is why I was proud to help pass the bipartisan Iran-China Energy Sanctions Act and the Stop Harboring Iranium Petroleum (SHIP) Act. Can you elaborate more on these sanctions and additional actions the Administration is taking to reduce the risk of Iran-funded terrorism against America and our allies? Secretary Yellen. We have taken a wide array of sanctions actions to try to stop the flow of illicit funds from Iran that funds terrorist groups--the Houthis, Hezbollah, and others. We have worked jointly with other countries to impose--we are really using every tool that we have to crack down on that as well as sources of revenue, including oil revenues that enable Iran to have the funds to distribute to these terrorist groups. Mr. Gottheimer. Do you think we need to do more to address cooperative sanctions of Asian between Iran and our other adversaries, including Russia, China, and Venezuela? Secretary Yellen. I'm sorry, what specifically do you have in mind? Mr. Gottheimer. Are we doing anything there? Is that something that is on your front burner, that you are concerned about, the sanctions of Asians? Secretary Yellen. We note that there are oil shipments that Iran has, and we have systematically tried to shut that down and recently taken very significant actions that military groups in Iran have used to support their activities, oil shipments. Mr. Gottheimer. Thank you. Madam Secretary, are you familiar with the recent State laws that require banks to provide an explanation with specific reasons for closing or denying an account, including in situations where the decision was related to financial crimes risk? Secretary Yellen. Yes. Mr. Gottheimer. I am concerned that these State laws may conflict with Federal requirements, especially the obligations that banks have under the Federal anti-money laundering laws that prevent terrorists and illicit financing of the U.S. financial systems. I presume you share those concerns? Secretary Yellen. It is a Federal obligation to file suspicious activity reports and comply with the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, and that is something that we require and expect all banking organizations to do. Mr. Gottheimer. Are you doing anything to address this issue, this conflict here? Secretary Yellen. I am certainly stating that it is an obligation of banks and that we would enforce it. Mr. Gottheimer. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into the record a bipartisan letter signed by my colleagues on this committee, Representatives Luetkemeyer and Sherman, please. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. Gottheimer. Thank you. We urge you and your counterparts at the OCC and FinCEN to look into this issue, please, and act. And I hope--if it is okay, I would love for our teams to sit down together and talk about actions that we can take. Secretary Yellen. I would be glad to do that. Mr. Gottheimer. Thank you so much. In my last 30 seconds, I just want to zoom in on a terror financing issue for just a minute. With respect to Iran, do you agree that the IRGC's designation as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist organization, as a foreign terrorist organization, should not be lifted until such time that it has demonstrated that it has permanently ceased the conduct for which it was designated in the first place? Secretary Yellen. I haven't looked into the exact requirements, but that is probably reasonable. Mr. Gottheimer. Yes, I am concerned about that, and, of course, looking at the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) employees who participated on October 7th, and I hope you are looking that as well. Secretary Yellen. We think that those who were responsible for the atrocities should be held to account. Mr. Gottheimer. Thank you. I yield back. Thank you. Mr. Luetkemeyer. The gentleman's time has expired. With that, we will go to the gentleman from New York, Mr. Lawler, for 5 minutes. Mr. Lawler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Secretary, when was the last time you met with President Biden in person? Secretary Yellen. I meet with President Biden over a wide range of issues--the economy, China, Russia. Mr. Lawler. When was the last time you met with him in person? Secretary Yellen. I am not going to comment on my meetings with the President. Those are private. Mr. Lawler. Well, as a Cabinet Secretary, have you noticed any mental or cognitive decline in any of these meetings? Secretary Yellen. The President is extremely effective in the meetings that I have been in with him. That includes many international meetings that are multi-hour, like his meetings with President Xi. I have met with him with other leaders who are in---- Mr. Lawler. So, are you testifying that you have not seen any mental or cognitive decline? Mrs. Beatty. Mr. Chairman, a point of inquiry. She is not a physician. Mr. Lawler. She is a member of the Cabinet. Mrs. Beatty. You are asking her a medical question. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Let's keep the comments to the subject of today. Mr. Lawler. It is not a medical question; it is her interpretation as a Member of the Cabinet. Mrs. Beatty. And I move to have those words taken down. Mr. Chairman, I move to have those words taken down. She is not a physician. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Will people please not go between the witness and the committee? Okay. Mr. Lawler, she has answered the question. Let's move on. You are recognized for the balance of your time. Mr. Lawler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Secretary, have there been any discussions among Cabinet Secretaries about invoking the 25th Amendment? Secretary Yellen. No. Mr. Lawler. Okay. The supplemental appropriations bill enacted in April contained two of my bills, the SHIP Act, which requires the imposition of sanctions on foreign ports and refineries that knowingly process Iranian oil, and the Iran- China Energy Sanctions Act, which requires you to close corresponding accounts for Chinese banks if they are involved in petroleum transactions with the Central Bank of Iran or another sanctioned Iranian financial institution. This applies no matter how minor or infrequent the transaction may be. In March, General Kurilla, the head of CENTCOM, testified before the Armed Services Committee that Iran continues to sell 90 percent of its oil to China, funding Tehran's subversive activities across the region. That is a quote. Anyone who participates in the sale of Iranian oil plays a role in helping the regime evade U.S. sanctions. Engaging in this trade is tantamount to aiding and abetting a terrorist state, and it must end. These sanctions create a significant financial incentive for ports and refineries to stop dealing in Iranian oil, or else lose access to the U.S. economy. Since Joe Biden took office, Iranian oil sales are up over $100 billion, a $100 billion increase. Can you speak to where you are in implementing these laws, the SHIP Act and the Iran-China Energy Sanctions Act, and will you commit to swiftly implementing these sanctions as required by the law? Secretary Yellen. I need to look into the details of where we are with respect to these particular Acts, but we have put in place a wide array of sanctions on Iran, including for oil dealings. We have sanctioned firms in other countries that are involved with the Iran oil trade, and we are constantly evaluating additional sanctions to put in place---- Mr. Lawler. Since the supplemental aid package passed, have you had any meetings on the SHIP Act or the Iran-China Energy Sanctions Act? Secretary Yellen. I have regular meetings with my staff---- Mr. Lawler. Have you had any discussions on those two provisions of the supplemental? Secretary Yellen. I have discussed Iranian sanctions with them. Mr. Lawler. Specifically, the SHIP Act and the Iran-China Energy Sanctions Act? Secretary Yellen. That is not the way we organize our discussions. We talk about our Iranian program and what we are doing. Mr. Lawler. I am going to interpret your answer to be, no, you have not had discussions on the SHIP Act and the Iran-China Energy Sanctions Act, and the Treasury Department has not advanced sanctions with respect to those two laws. Secretary Yellen. I have not said that. Mr. Lawler. Well, is it yes or no? Secretary Yellen. I have had discussions with them, and it has covered a wide array of sanctions issues in connection with Iran. I am not sure specifically which actions have to do with which aspects of the law---- Mr. Lawler. Okay. I sent a letter---- Secretary Yellen. ----and that is not how it is presented to me. Mr. Lawler. I sent a letter specifically on the SHIP Act and the Iran-China Energy Sanctions Act to you and Secretary of State Blinken a few weeks ago. We have not heard back. We certainly would appreciate a detailed response as to what has been done to implement the law that was passed under the supplemental aid package. And in my remaining time, have you communicated the sanctions risk to Beijing at all with respect to the Iran-China Energy Sanctions Act? Secretary Yellen. We have discussed with them our concerns about Chinese businesses and others involved with these matters. Mr. Lawler. But not specifically on the Iran-China Energy Sanctions Act? Secretary Yellen. We have discussed an array of sanctions issues. Mr. Lawler. Okay. Mr. Luetkemeyer. The gentleman's time has expired. Just a reminder to the committee that getting into the personal business of the President, as well as Mr. Trump, is inappropriate for this committee. With that, Ms. Tlaib from Michigan is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. Tlaib. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Secretary, for being here. As you probably know, many of the countries in the global south are facing a tremendous debt burden, almost--I think that is almost half of the world's population right now, 3.3 billion people are impacted by this, living in countries that spend more on the interest on their debt than the healthcare or education in their communities. And you know the IMF issues fees called surcharges on heavily-indebted countries. Secretary Yellen, do you believe that developing countries suffering through a perfect storm of global crises, including shocks to the food and fuel prices, soaring interest rates, climate change, and so much more, should be required to pay these fees on top of the interest they pay on their debt? Secretary Yellen. The surcharges framework we think is important to create appropriate incentives to repay the IMF in a timely way and to contain borrowings. But the IMF, with our support, is currently reviewing this policy. Ms. Tlaib. Do you support that review? Secretary Yellen. Yes, we are supportive of the review. Ms. Tlaib. Perfect. Can you explain to our residents what the Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) are at the IMF? Secretary Yellen. Special Drawing Rights are essentially a system in which countries agree to provide lines--the way I think of it is providing countries with additional lines of credit that are in proportion to their quotas at the IMF, and-- -- Ms. Tlaib. I love telling my residents that it actually is--it would provide immediate relief to countries across the globe while costing the U.S. taxpayer nothing, absolutely nothing. Is that correct? Does it cost our U.S. taxpayer any money? Secretary Yellen. No. No, we earn interest on special if we provide hard currency for Special Drawing Rights. We earn interest on that, and it doesn't cost us anything. Ms. Tlaib. And, Secretary Yellen, is the United States actually standing in the way of new issuance or looking at the Special Drawing Rights? Secretary Yellen. We thought at the onset and after the pandemic struck, which hit so many countries, and created a global shortage of liquidity, that an SDR allocation was appropriate, and one took place, a large SDR allocation. At this point, we don't think an SDR allocation is needed or appropriate---- Ms. Tlaib. So, you don't think a new issuance is required? Secretary Yellen. ----but we have---- Ms. Tlaib. I don't want to send a message that our country, Secretary, doesn't--that our message to developing countries is that the U.S. is unwilling to respond to the debt crisis. Secretary Yellen. We have been very supportive of an expansion of the poverty reduction in growth trust. Congress-- -- Ms. Tlaib. But why not just help them? I don't understand. Secretary Yellen. It does help them because it gives interest-free loans to the countries that are most in need. Ms. Tlaib. So, more debt. The way the international financial institutions are governed is inconsistent---- Secretary Yellen. It is that SDRs are, in a way, debt too-- -- Ms. Tlaib. I know, but---- Secretary Yellen. ----because countries that use them do have to pay interest on them. So, it is not that different. Ms. Tlaib. Yes. The way the international financial institutions are governed is inconsistent with the democratic ideals we seek at home. And in the IMF, for example, the U.S. and other G7 countries get 41 percent of votes despite only having 10 percent of the global population. So, Secretary Yellen, what would you say to countries who feel we don't practice what we preach when it comes to democratic decision- making and to international financial institution? Secretary Yellen. We have certainly been supportive of governance reforms that increase the role and the voice of borrowing countries so that they have more say and representation. We have supported adding directors who represent low-income countries. And we have supported the idea of reviewing the formula that would determine quota allocations in the future. We have been opposed to an ad hoc quota review that would reallocate in a sort of ad hoc way voting rights, but we are supportive of the IMF reviewing the formula that determines voting rights. Ms. Tlaib. Thank you. Thank you, Secretary. I yield back. Mr. Luetkemeyer. The gentlelady's time has expired. The gentlelady from Indiana, Mrs. Houchin, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. Houchin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to the ranking member. And thank you, Secretary Yellen, for your testimony and for being here today. Like many of my colleagues, I have concerns about the ways in which this Administration continues to support policies and practices at international financial institutions that do nothing to further American interests, and instead, seem to only help China and our competitors continue to make gains at our expense. From allowing mission creep into social and climate issues, to giving our adversaries the upper hand in key geostrategic regions, this Administration has been allowing America's influence abroad to be undermined, and it has to stop. Starting with the first of this month and running until the end of next June, the World Bank is aiming to devote 45 percent of its financing to climate-related programs. In the Bank's latest annual report, climate was referred to some 200 times, largely in the context of the Bank's green energy investments and reducing the reliance of developing countries on fossil fuels. At the same time, China has been taking an all-of-the-above approach to energy investments, pushing renewable energy while also developing oil and gas resources. One of our foremost concerns when it comes to China and the CCP is the extent to which they exert their influence over developing countries by providing funding for basic necessities. When half the population of Sub-Saharan Africa does not have access to electricity to begin with, it is not hard to see why China's influence in that area might be growing. Secretary Yellen, if 45 percent of the Bank's resources are chasing arbitrary climate targets, why wouldn't developing countries keep looking to China and to Chinese lenders to meet their core developmental needs? Secretary Yellen. The World Bank and the MDBs are heavily focused on broad development goals, relieving poverty, and ensuring sustainable growth. But achieving those goals is also linked to addressing climate, which is increasingly compromising the development goals, especially in the poorest places, and climate and access to electricity are linked. At the spring IMF World Bank meetings, President Banga---- Mrs. Houchin. Secretary Yellen, I'm sorry, I only have 5 minutes, so I am going to go on to another question. Sixty percent of the U.S. electricity generation does come from fossil fuels, but as part of this Administration's climate agenda you are voting against virtually all World Bank fossil fuel projects in Africa. Why is the Treasury holding Africans to a standard that the wealthiest countries in the world cannot meet? Secretary Yellen. This reflects the goals that Africa itself has that very often, most often, renewables aren't the cheapest way of developing energy, and it is a question of bringing electricity in Africa--six hundred million Africans lack electricity and renewables. Both address climate change and resilience, and are the cheapest way of bringing electricity to those who don't have it. Mrs. Houchin. Okay. Secretary Yellen. There is a goal of bringing---- Mrs. Houchin. One of the most egregious examples of the World Bank empowering China in its efforts to expand its geopolitical influence has been through allowing the CCP to overbuild its production capacity in certain products in order to flood the markets in other countries. They have done that with industries like aluminum extrusion and now, they have done it with solar technology. Last May, the President doubled U.S. tariffs on Chinese solar cells. And since the World Bank is aiming to direct 45 percent of its financing in the next year to climate projects, the Bank's money may still just go to purchase Chinese solar panels, batteries, and the like. This seems to be supporting China financially in their efforts to expand their geopolitical footprint. Why is the Treasury supporting this if the Department is concerned with Chinese overcapacity and the CCP dominating the market in green energy industries? Secretary Yellen. We are very concerned about and attentive to procurement strategies and make sure that all of the MDBs have open processes and that American firms know--American firms rarely bid on these contracts, and we want them to do so. Mrs. Houchin. Does Treasury intend to roll back the reliance on Chinese solar panels in order to prevent them from profiting financially from the United States in this way? Secretary Yellen. If American firms or other firms can provide these solar panels and bid on those contracts, then certainly, there would be less use of Chinese products in those---- Mrs. Houchin. We would certainly hope that U.S. companies would be chosen over Chinese companies when it comes to solar panels. Thank you very much. I yield back. Mr. Luetkemeyer. The gentlelady's time has expired. With that, we go to the gentleman from New York, Mr. Torres. Mr. Torres. Thank you. Madam Secretary, what impact on Treasury rulemaking do you expect from the loss of Chevron deference? Do you expect the impact to be disruptive, minimal, or is it too early to tell? Secretary Yellen. I am concerned about the Chevron decision. As the White House has indicated, it limits the use of agency expertise in designing rules or deferring to rules that we put in place subject to congressional legislation, but we intend to go on with rulemaking efforts, and protect the American people through those rulemakings, and our legal team is evaluating whether or not there is specific implications. I am not aware of anything specific so far. Mr. Torres. I have a question about the semiconductor arms race with China. According to a report by the Boston Consulting Group and the Semiconductor Industry Association, by 2032, the United States will account for 30 percent of advanced semiconductor production, compared to only 2 percent for China. Do you believe, as I do, that these projections demonstrate the success of the Biden strategy, the combination of chips investment in America and the export controls on China? Secretary Yellen. I do. Yes, I would agree with that. Mr. Torres. And Madam Secretary, you have been sounding the alarm about China's overcapacity---- Secretary Yellen. Yes. Mr. Torres. ----of legacy chip making. According to the same report, by 2032 China will account for one-fifth of chips in the range of 10 to 22 nanometers and one-third of chips above 28 nanometers. What actions should the United States take to combat China's overcapacity of legacy chip making, and when should we take those actions? Secretary Yellen. The recent actions of putting tariffs in place did include some legacy chips. And of course, the semiconductor in the CHIPS Act is designed to promote additional production in the United States to secure our supply chains and to gain the dynamic benefits that come from producing and learning in the process of production, and developing new technologies. Mr. Torres. On a separate topic, the Financial Times has reported that Chinese organized crime operates a network of underground banks that launder money for both Mexican cartels who are trafficking in fentanyl and Chinese nationals whose capital is fleeing China. Chinese money laundering is essentially financing the deadliest drug crisis in American history, a crisis whose latest death toll surpasses 100,000 Americans. What role is the Treasury Department playing in policing the illicit finance at the heart of America's deadliest drug crisis? Secretary Yellen. I certainly agree that it is a national tragedy, what has happened with drugs, particularly fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, and Treasury is using every tool at its disposal to try to crack down and reduce the flow of illicit drugs into the United States. That includes by direct sanctions that we put on firms in China and elsewhere that are providing precursors. We have an agreement to work collaboratively with China to reduce the activities of Chinese firms in supplying precursors to Mexico. We are working collaboratively with Mexico. We have announced many new sanctions actions, and are cracking down---- Mr. Torres. I do worry that the CCP is stringing us along-- 97 percent of the fentanyl precursors are manufactured in China. Xi Jinping has the power to unilaterally shut down the supply chains that account for almost all of those fentanyl precursors. At what point does the United States impose sanctions on China for perpetuating the deadliest drug crisis in American history? Secretary Yellen. We have seen China take some positive steps in recent months, and we will try to build on that, but I wouldn't rule out anything in the future. Mr. Torres. Okay. Thank you, Madam Secretary. Mr. Luetkemeyer. The gentleman yields back. The gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Lucas, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Lucas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary, thank you for appearing before the committee today. I think you would agree that the health and resiliency of the global financial system is tied to the capital levels of global banks. Treasury's core mission is, of course, to provide for a strong economy and to protect the integrity of the financial system. During our discussion when you last appeared before the committee, you largely deferred to the Fed, the FDIC, and the OCC on the details of the Basel Proposal. I have been particularly focused on the negative impact the proposal would have on our capital markets, which are critical to the U.S. economy, and I hope this is an area to which you are also paying close attention. We are in a situation where the Chairman of the Fed today, during Senate testimony, said he still expects major revisions and would like to reopen the proposal for comment. At the FDIC, the current Chairman has announced that he will resign to restore confidence in the agency, while his replacement is awaiting Senate confirmation hearings. And at the OCC, we have an Acting Comptroller who has not been confirmed by the Senate. At the very least, given the expected revisions, reopening the proposal for further comment seems reasonable. Secretary Yellen, is it still your stance not to take a public position on the details of the Basel Proposal? Secretary Yellen. I am not going to take a stand on the details. I think that is up to the banking agencies and the rulemaking process that they will go through. As you noted, the agencies are planning significant revisions in response to all of the comments that they have received, and I am certainly supportive of their going through that process and revising as appropriate. Mr. Lucas. Secretary, I appreciate the position you are in, and given your history at the Fed, you are uniquely positioned to understand the far-reaching impact of the Basel Proposal and the potential for unintended consequences. Now, shifting focus, I would like to discuss the U.S. Treasury market. The global financial system depends on a well- functioning Treasury market, the deepest and most-liquid market in the world, where any disruptions could create risk across capital markets. You have heard my concern about the Basel Endgame's impact on the Treasury market, paired with significant market structure reforms coming from the SEC. You have assured the committee that you are monitoring this, along with your interagency counterparts. Given the importance of the Treasury market to the United States and the world, we should ensure robust participation. Under Secretary Liang has suggested that excluding excess reserves held in the Federal Reserve System from the leverage ratio would be effective during times of market distress. The Fed did this in 2020, and it was effective. Secretary Yellen, do you agree that there are beneficial reforms that could increase participation in the U.S. Treasury markets? Secretary Yellen. That certainly is a reform that was worthy of discussion. And at the time, I thought it was very appropriate to take that step and would be supportive of greater liquidity in the Treasury market. But again, this is a decision for the banking regulators, but I would hope that they would take this into account. Mr. Lucas. The U.S. Treasury market is the most important market in the world and the bedrock of the global financial system, and I would encourage you to support those efforts to boost market liquidity and resilience. One last question. Two pieces of legislation led by myself and Representative Luetkemeyer officially added the Secretary of Agriculture to CFIUS, and improved the referral process of the agricultural transactions for review. Could you describe how CFIUS scrutinizes transactions in the agriculture sector and the relationship with the USDA, if you can? Secretary Yellen. For land transactions that occur in the vicinity of military installations that have been identified as the Department of Defense's critical ones, there is scrutiny of transactions, and, in some cases, there has even been outright--I think that in the MineOne case, the President ordered divestment of activities that were going on in the vicinity of a military installation. And yesterday, Treasury issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that follows a comprehensive study by the Department of Defense that adds 50 additional military bases, and changes the geographic limitations of others. Mr. Lucas. Thank you, Secretary. And thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the effort that you and I have put into making this possible. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Thank you. The gentleman yields back. I think it is very important that we address this situation. I appreciate your working with us, and I appreciate the Secretary's work on it as well. The gentleman from Nevada, Mr. Horsford, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Horsford. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the ranking member. Madam Secretary, it's good to see you again. Housing remains the number-one issue in my district that I hear about from my constituents, but that should be no surprise, as Nevada is currently bearing the brunt of this country's affordable housing crisis. Supply or, rather, a key lack of supply remains the driver behind our affordability emergency, which has left southern Nevada with only 13 affordable and available rental units for every 100 low-income households. This is an unconscionable level of scarcity, and incentivizing construction is the only feasible path forward. It is going to take strong public-private partnerships, as well as coordination with housing developers, to spur the investment necessary to make housing affordable for everyone. To do so, we must work with the tools available to us to leverage our Tax Code and make increased construction of these projects feasible across the country. Under your purview is the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program, one of the most powerful incentives that we have to provide the necessary support for the development of affordable housing. However, I have heard from my local developers that this effective credit could be more efficient, which would expand the population that it can serve. There are necessary improvements that the program could achieve which are included in my legislation, the Housing Market Transparency Act. The bill would create a central repository for State housing agencies to provide critical information on housing developments, such as the construction costs, quality of living spaces, health and safety information, and ownership data. The public-private partnerships of the LIHTC program that make it such an effective method of bringing affordable units to a community also create inherent issues with transparency. So, Madam Secretary, could Treasury and the IRS make LIHTC more efficient if you were able to capture comprehensive data on these properties? And, additionally, what other improvements to the LIHTC program do you recommend to help further incentivize the badly-needed construction of more affordable developments? Secretary Yellen. Treasury certainly supports efforts to improve transparency and accountability that are consistent with legal requirements. And we are very happy to review the bill that you have introduced and try to provide technical assistance. We could work with the IRS on administration of the LIHTC and see if there are interactions there that would be favorable. I completely agree that we have a real crisis with respect to affordable housing. I would say generally, Treasury is trying to think of how it can use every single tool at our disposal to improve the supply of affordable housing. I was in Minneapolis a few weeks ago and was able to announce that we are using $100 million that is income from our investments in the CDFIs to plow it back into affordable housing. And, of course, with respect to LIHTC, the President's budget proposes increased funding of LIHTC, which would be very important. The President proposed a program that would expand affordable housing by 2 million units, and I would love to see that become law. Mr. Horsford. I agree with the need to build more housing to address the affordability housing crisis. Madam Secretary, I also wanted to note the incredible success from the Direct File program, and I am pleased that Treasury recently announced that you will be making this Direct File program permanent. Nevada had the fifth-best uptake of the program of any State in the country. Notably, 90 percent of the respondents rated the program as excellent or above average. So, I believe that we need to continue to promote the Direct File program and expand and permanently reauthorize it so that Nevadans will be able to have that support all year to learn about their options to direct file and to earn the tax credits and benefits that they deserve. Especially as we have debates about who should get the tax benefits, it should be the working people of America, not big corporations or billionaires. Secretary Yellen. Thank you. Mr. Horsford. With that, I yield back. Mr. Luetkemeyer. The gentleman yields back. I will now recognize myself for 5 minutes. Welcome, Secretary Yellen. It's good to see you again today. We have discussed this issue in the past. My concern initially was a very slow response with regard to sanctions that were put on all things that could be helpful to Russia whenever they invaded Ukraine, and I asked you the last couple of times you have been here, in your position as head of FSOC, is there a committee or a group that is being put together to be able to have sanctions immediately ready to put on China when China invades Taiwan? Our own generals say it is going to happen over the next 3 years. Therefore, I think we need to have a plan in place so it doesn't take several months like it did with Russia, because I think, in order for us to be impactful, we have to do this very quickly. You indicated the last time you were here that there is a committee that is working on this. Would you like to discuss that a bit more? Secretary Yellen. Sure. There are interagency discussions around Taiwan. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Do those discussions include working with our allies to be able to identify different entities, different groups, to be able to sanction and make it more difficult for China to economically continue once they invade, and we put sanctions on them? Secretary Yellen. I'm sorry. I am not really able to discuss what---- Mr. Luetkemeyer. I don't want specifics; I just want generalities here. I understand. But I think it is important for us to know as a committee, in order to provide our oversight, that there is a concern about this, number one, and, number two, that there are discussions going on, and that they include allies to be able to address this issue when and if it occurs. Secretary Yellen. We have many discussions about common issues with our allies. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Okay. Secretary Yellen. And I would include this in that list, but I am not able to provide any specifics. Mr. Luetkemeyer. I understand. Thank you very much. The next question is a bit different. What is your greatest concern when it comes to foreign finance issues like this? Secretary Yellen. When it comes to what? Mr. Luetkemeyer. With foreign finance. We are talking about foreign financial institutions and different issues today with regards to the international financial system. What is your greatest concern about all of this? Secretary Yellen. About foreign financial institutions? Mr. Luetkemeyer. Yes. Things that you are involved with, things that are concerning to our country, whether it be CFIUS or whether it be sanctions or whether it be artificial intelligence. What is the biggest concern you have when it comes to international financial relationships and issues? Secretary Yellen. I have many different concerns, but in the realm of sanctions, we have very powerful sanctions that are available because of the important role of the dollar in international transactions. The ability to cut off foreign banks or other businesses or individuals from the ability to transact through the U.S. financial system and to participate in the dollar rise---- Mr. Luetkemeyer. Okay. So basically, your protection of the dollar is one of your greatest concerns? Secretary Yellen. I think that is important, and the more we have used sanctions, the more countries look for ways to engage in financial transactions that don't involve the dollar. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Okay. According to Executive Order 13818, a foreign person is to be sanctioned if the Treasury Secretary finds them responsible for, or complicit in, or directly or indirectly engaged in serious human rights abuse. With regards to Russia, we sanctioned Vladimir Putin and the Foreign Minister following the invasion of Ukraine. With respect to the Uyghur genocide, is it Treasury's position that the standard for sanctions applies to--with respect to the Uyghurs, is it Treasury's position that this standard applies for sanctions against Xi Jinping? And, if not, why has the Chinese leadership been spared? Secretary Yellen. We have engaged in sanctions related to the Uyghurs under the forced---- Mr. Luetkemeyer. My question is, you sanctioned the leadership of Russia, but you haven't sanctioned the leadership of China. Why? That is the basic question. Secretary Yellen. This is a basic foreign policy issue that is better addressed---- Mr. Luetkemeyer. Well, sanctions fall under your jurisdiction. So, the Administration and you working together have not felt that this is important yet? Secretary Yellen. This is a question I would suggest that you refer to the State Department. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Okay. I know that one of our Members talked about the sanctions against various banks in China with regards to drug money and the laundering of Mexican cartel money. I think it is important that we continue that. I sit on the Chinese Select Committee, and it is a really big deal that we continue to sanction those banks that facilitate the money laundering of money from the drug cartels because that is one of the ways we can kind of thwart that. With that, I yield back. The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Nickel, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Nickel. Thank you so much, Secretary Yellen, for being here today. I was very glad to hear you commit to Congressman Hill that you will continue to work with Congress to create a regulatory structure for digital assets and that you hope it will reach a, ``good conclusion.'' I think it is especially important that we continue to work on this issue in a bipartisan way. This Congress is on track to be one of the least-productive in our nation's history, but this is a place where we have had good bipartisan agreement, and I hope you will continue to make it a priority for this Administration. I also want to talk about your role as Chair of FSOC and want to echo Congressman Flood's concerns with the concentration risk in the market for crypto custody due to the SEC's misguided Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121) which makes crypto less safe for consumers. We have the best banks in the world. They ought to be able to take care of this custodial banking piece. But I appreciate your attention to these important issues. And I certainly want to applaud you and your agency's important leadership on the global stage so that you can move forward American interests, repair alliances, and isolate dictators. My first question is about Russian oil. In April, I joined a bipartisan fact-finding mission in Ukraine to show our support in their war against Putin's aggression and unprovoked attack on their country. After I met with President Zelensky, it was clear to me that we need to do as much as we can to prevent Russia from fueling the war with profits from their oil exports. If we fail, we hand over Ukraine to Russia, and we know an emboldened Putin will continue on to eastern Europe. The U.S.-led oil price cap has reduced Russian export earnings significantly, but there is a lot more to do. On the whole, we are seeing countries comply with the price cap restrictions, but China, India, and Russia have access to limited non-G7 shipping and insurance services which don't have to comply with the cap. Secretary Yellen, what is the strategy to address the price cap circumvention? And how do you propose that we hold these countries and entities accountable? Secretary Yellen. As you said, at first, we had a very big impact on Russian revenues. And then, to circumvent the price cap, they invested very heavily in the shadow fleet of vessels and insurance coverage so they would free themselves of dependence on Western services, including shipping. That is expensive, and they have really diverted a lot of resources from other uses in order to build that fleet. Then, we took the step this past year of sanctioning some of the ships, the Sovcomflot ships that are involved in this trade and that appeared to be effective in widening the discount that they received on Russian oil. And we continue to look at expanding those sanctions. Our goals from the outset with respect to the price cap were twofold: we want to reduce Russian revenues or, alternatively, raise their costs of selling oil; and we want to keep the market well-supplied. And so, as we contemplate additional sanctions, we really also look at what impact do we think that our actions could have on the global oil market. If our sanctions raise global oil prices significantly, that would be a negative not only to American drivers but also to countries around the world that are dependent on foreign oil. So, we are going to be careful about doing it, but we continue to look at additional sanctions. Mr. Nickel. Thanks so much. As the world looks for alternatives to Russian and Iranian oil, nuclear energy must play a role. Governments around the world are shifting policies toward nuclear power as a clean, reliable source of 24/7 electricity. I am very glad the Administration has rallied the world and secured pledges from 22 countries to triple their nuclear energy capacity by 2050. Unfortunately, Russia and China continue to dominate the global nuclear market. Meanwhile, U.S. companies are competing against foreign governments without meaningful support from the Federal Government. When countries in key strategic areas around the world need civil nuclear energy, I don't want them to rely on Russia and China. What should Congress be doing to assist the Administration in deploying nuclear energy around the world? Secretary Yellen. All I can really say here is that Treasury is supportive of using all available technologies, including nuclear. Our role is with the multilateral development banks. They, with the exception of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), don't touch nuclear, and we have been supportive of having them review their policies in this area. Mr. Nickel. My time has expired. Mr. Luetkemeyer. The gentleman's time has expired. The gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Huizenga, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Huizenga. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Madam Secretary, it's good to see you again. I want to start with an issue that is important to a sizable population in my district, in the Battle Creek-Springfield area of Michigan, which is home to about 5,000 Burmese citizens. Last year, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued a directive that prohibited Americans from providing any such services directly or indirectly that would benefit the Myanma Oil & Gas Enterprise, also known as MOGE. And actually, I would like, Mr. Chairman, to submit a copy of that for the record. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. Huizenga. And last year as well, in consultation with the State Department, Treasury--you--determined that MOGE is a political subdivision of the military junta in Burma, in other words, the Burmese Government. The MOGE generates a billion U.S. dollars annually, and is by far their largest foreign revenue for Burma and, by extension, the junta. Unfortunately, late last year, Treasury stopped short of listing the MOGE as a Specially Designated National (SDN) which, as you know, not only blocks the assets but then puts other countries on notice that they shouldn't be doing business with this designated entity. So, Madam Secretary, why hasn't Treasury used its authority to block the MOGE from receiving financial support from around the world which is funding an abuse of government? And, frankly, what I would like to know is what would you have to say to my constituents, and what am I supposed to tell these folks, many who have fled the civil war in Burma, the genocide that is happening, the continued bombings that are happening, for their family members who are still living in these horrific conditions? Secretary Yellen. We absolutely are committed to denying the Burmese military sources of funding that they are using to suppress the restoration of democracy. Mr. Huizenga. So, why would you leave them off that particular list? Secretary Yellen. We did announce sanctions relative to MOGE, and we issued a directive that prohibits U.S. persons from providing financial services to MOGE for its benefit. Mr. Huizenga. I understand. But again, you left them off a list that would have toughened those up. And frankly, in response to that, last week, along with my colleagues from this committee, Mrs. Wagner and Mr. Sherman, we introduced the bipartisan BRAVE Burma Act, which requires the President to determine on an annual basis whether to impose stronger block sanctions on MOGE, on the Myanma Economic Bank, and on foreign persons operating in the jet fuel sector of the Burmese economy. That is where those bombings are coming from, and jet fuel is a critical piece to the junta continuing the genocide that is there. So, Mr. Chairman, clearly, I believe more work needs to be done, and I look forward to having this bill actually be a part of a markup. But, Madam Secretary, I need you to take a closer look at that because we, frankly, need your support. Secretary Yellen. I promise that I will do that. And we certainly are concerned with the situation in Burma, and are contemplating additional sanction actions, and we will work with you on that. Mr. Huizenga. Yes. I am not going to get into this right now, but we have seen some of those sanctions slip in other areas like Iran and Russia, and I am concerned about that. And we can continue that conversation. I am not expecting you to know details about this. This was from a letter we sent yesterday. And, Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit that for the record as well. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. Huizenga. The letter is concerning significant problems with the enforcement of U.S. sanctions against the Taliban officials. In May, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, also known as SIGAR, highlighted that since the failed withdrawal from Afghanistan in August of 2021, $10.9 million in U.S. taxpayer money has been paid to the Taliban in the form of taxes, fees, duties, and utilities. First of all, is there any reason to doubt the Inspector General and his report? Secretary Yellen. I have not had a chance to review it. And without looking at it---- Mr. Huizenga. The report was from May. Our letter was from yesterday, and I would appreciate a quick response to our inquiry on this. I think this is a significant problem. And I know, in D.C., we talk about trillions and billions, but $10.9 million of U.S. taxpayer dollars being used to pay the Taliban government taxes, fees, duties, et cetera, seems outside the bounds. Mr. Chairman, I know my time is up, but I do appreciate the opportunity to continue this conversation with you, Madam Secretary. I yield back. Mr. Luetkemeyer. The gentleman's time has expired. With that, we will go to the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Gonzalez, for 5 minutes. Mr. Gonzalez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Madam Secretary, for being with us this morning. I am pleased that the Treasury Department noticed the proposed rulemaking concerning the outbound investments screening program. There is no doubt that U.S. money should be kept out of the hands of Chinese and Russian firms. I also want to add another angle concerning foreign investment that is a concern to us in south Texas, and I think along the border. Many of our constituents are seeing Chinese money flooding into Mexico where manufacturing facilities are, and are being developed south of the border so goods can be shipped to the United States as a Mexican product instead of a Chinese product. And I worry that, if we consider only the direct U.S. investments into Chinese or Russian factories that can produce technology of concern, those investments may be directed instead to factories overseas and Chinese-owned companies in third nations. Will the Treasury Department consider or have you already considered those sorts of nonlinear investments that aim to evade the goals of the President's outbound investment screening program? If not this mechanism, in what capacity could we work together in order to prevent U.S. investments from funding, for example, the semiconductor factory in Mexico that is owned by Chinese entities? Secretary Yellen. I think you raise an important issue, and it is one that we are aware of at Treasury. I made a visit to Mexico last year, and this is a matter that I have discussed with senior Mexican officials. We are having discussions with them about developing their own investment screening mechanism similar to our CFIUS. They are open to discussing and working with us on that, and I think that is a first step in looking at these issues. We realize the North American market is highly integrated and that we have a common interest in this---- Mr. Gonzalez. That is what my next question was going to be. Have they been forthcoming in wanting to work with us? Secretary Yellen. They have been. And I discussed this when I was in Mexico at a press conference that I gave there. Mr. Gonzalez. It is a huge concern not only to our direct investments but a lot of things that are happening with the Chinese moving into that region. Secretary Yellen. You are right, and it is an important issue. Mr. Gonzalez. Thank you. Also, in 2023, Mexico received a record $63 billion in remittances, a 7.6-percent increase from 2022, 95 percent of which came from the United States. With the recent surge in remittances, I am concerned that this has inadvertently made it easier for some of the Mexican cartels to launder drug money, and for cartels to use civilians as conduits for remittances, who then hand the money back to the cartels, a practice known as, ``smurfing.'' What is being done to limit the use of remittances as an avenue to finance illicit activities? How can we identify and monitor laundering schemes run through legitimate financial transactions? And I feel there is an increase--there was a recent report by a Reuters journalist who was down there and actually followed one of the ladies in Sinaloa who went to one of these places to collect the money, and then kept a very small slice of it and gave the majority of it back to the cartels. It is a huge concern as remittances grow, and I think certainly, they are harder to monitor and police. What are we doing and what cooperation do we have from Mexico? I think that should be a clear area of concern. I just see it as very unregulated. Secretary Yellen. We have certainly been focused on Mexican drug cartels and have been cracking down on them with Mexico's cooperation. With respect to remittances, many of them occur through money services businesses. And those businesses are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act's Anti-Money Laundering/ Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) compliance regime. Mr. Gonzalez. There has been a spike in the resources coming into Mexico, and it is just a concern being on the border. Seeing all of the activity and the growth of Mexican cartels on the other side of the border is really worrisome, and I think we should pay closer attention to this. There is a Mexican think tank that just said that $4.4 billion of the money that we remitted to Mexico last year was sent directly to cartels, so I hope that we can continue to work on this issue. Secretary Yellen. It is an important issue. Of course, we want to work on it. Mr. Gonzalez. Okay. Thank you so much. Mr. Luetkemeyer. The gentleman's time has expired. Just a reminder, the Secretary does have a hard stop at 1:00 today, so we are going to try and squeeze in as many Members as we can here. The gentleman from Kentucky, Mr. Barr, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Barr. Thank you. Madam Secretary, I want to drill down into the Treasury Department's ineffective sanctions strategy when it comes to Russia. A June 26th Wall Street Journal article highlighted a collision of foreign energy policies within the Biden Administration and frustration among Treasury staffers over the lack of action against oil trading networks that ferry Russian and Iranian oil. While on the one hand, Treasury sanctions are attempts to, ``throw sand in the gears of Russia and Iran's oil export machines,'' the article identifies attempts by the National Economic Council (NEC), led by Lael Brainard, to keep global oil output up to ward off pressures on inflation and, ``keep gas prices stable ahead of the election by encouraging oil to flow into global markets.'' Secretary Yellen, who is running the show in the Administration? Those who want to be tough on our adversaries like Russia and Iran or those who want to ensure that global oil flows keep gas prices stable ahead of the election? Secretary Yellen. It is a very good question. I think the article is, frankly, very misleading because the NEC and Treasury are really on the same page. We have been working together closely, and we really have identical goals. Mr. Barr. So, you're on the same page in terms of trying to defend this failed oil price cap scheme? Secretary Yellen. I'm sorry. I don't think it is a failed-- -- Mr. Barr. Let me reclaim my time. Bloomberg reported last week that Russia's government revenues from oil sales rose almost 50 percent compared to last year. If this is not an indictment of Treasury's licensing policy and the failure of the oil price cap scheme, I don't know what is. Secretary Yellen. It worked very well in the first year---- Mr. Barr. Not anymore, Madam Secretary. Secretary Yellen. ----when they should--okay. Mr. Barr. Let me reclaim my time. I offered an amendment to the Financial Services Appropriations bill. I got 30 Democrats to vote to sanction Russian oil exports--30 Democrats, mostly climate-oriented Democrats. This Administration, which has this massive climate focus, wants to punish American energy production. That is the whole strategy, through ESG and climate disclosure and no permitting, no licenses, no Keystone Pipeline. But, when it comes to Putin's oil machine, license it, allow exports of Russian energy. What on Earth are you all doing? Secretary Yellen. We have said explicitly from the very outset that we had two goals with the price cap program: number one, to apply pressure of revenue; and number two, to make sure the global oil market is well-supplied---- Mr. Barr. You failed at them both, Madam Secretary, because you are waging a war against American energy, but you are green-lighting Russian energy. You are weak on Russia. I want this Administration to revisit the failed oil price cap scheme and sanction the crap out of Vladimir Putin's energy, which is financing the war effort. Secretary Yellen. We are---- Mr. Barr. And the oil price cap is not working. Let me shift to China. Treasury has prohibited U.S. dealings with the publicly-traded securities of certain companies connected to the Chinese Military-Industrial Complex (CMIC). But, since being put on the CMIC list, Hikvision revenues have risen 30 percent, China Mobile stock prices shot up 90 percent, and Huawei, SMIC went on to develop an advanced 5G chip, and Huawei isn't public to begin with. Clearly, regulating the trading of publicly-traded securities has proven irrelevant. Why doesn't Treasury impose blocking sanctions on these CMIC companies? Secretary Yellen. I can't discuss particular cases, certainly not in this venue. We are always looking at entities that are engaging in activity that could merit sanctions. Mr. Barr. Well, Madam Secretary, would Treasury welcome the opportunity by legislation, my bill, on China outbound? You all have issued an Executive Order. I think it is Congress' responsibility to create an outbound investment framework. Would Treasury welcome an opportunity through legislation to explain on an annual basis why it has refrained from imposing full blocking sanctions on Chinese entities on the CMIC list? And it could perhaps be addressed in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF). Secretary Yellen. We can discuss it with you. I will have my staff be in touch with yours to understand what---- Mr. Barr. We have a list of Chinese Military-Industrial Complex companies, but Treasury hasn't sanctioned any of them. That is a really good question for Treasury to answer for the American people through their elected Representatives in Congress. And with that, I yield back. Mr. Luetkemeyer. The gentleman's time has expired. We will now go to the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Foster, for 5 minutes. Mr. Foster. Thank you. Secretary, was there anything you wanted to add about the oil cap policy that you didn't have a chance to during the previous round of questioning? Secretary Yellen. Thank you. What I wanted to say is that an objective is to keep the oil market well supplied so neither Americans nor residents of many countries around the globe, including the poorest, are faced with spiking energy prices. And we are considering additional sanctions on Soviet chips now that Russia has taken this approach, but we want to evaluate what the potential impact could be on global oil markets, and we are discussing that in an interagency basis. Mr. Foster. And I would also like to congratulate the Administration on having made a significant amount of money with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), whereby you are sort of monetizing your ability to store oil and to be able to sell at a high price and refill at a low price and make the taxpayer a whole pile of money. So, to the extent you were at the table there, good work. I would also like to second my congratulations on your successful pilot program for the IRS Free File System and believe it should be an option available to taxpayers at all income levels. I have been introducing legislation in this area for more than a decade, so it is really nice to see it come to pass. And, as a next step, in February, I reintroduced the Autofill Act, which would allow individuals who choose to download tax forms that are automatically populated with information that the IRS already collects from employers, from the Social Security information, and from financial institutions. Our Tax Code is complicated enough, and we shouldn't force people to keep shoeboxes full of all of these stubs they get, and then have to use them for their tax forms. This would be a common-sense solution in most countries, to just have the government fill out part of the forms with information they already have, so please consider that as a next step in strengthening this very successful pilot program. On April 24th, President Biden signed the REPO Act, which gives the Administration the authority to seize Russian assets and use them for the benefit of Ukraine's war effort and their eventual reconstruction. Last month, the G7 agreed in principle to use the interest earned on frozen Russian assets to back a $50-billion loan for Ukraine. And following that meeting, you said that the logistics was a little more complicated and that you could not provide a timeline for getting that money to Ukraine. Since you made those comments a few weeks ago, has progress been made to get the money to Ukraine? And what challenges are you running into from our G7 allies? Is there anything that Congress can do to speed this process along? Secretary Yellen. Thank you for that. The leaders in the G7 asked that we be ready by the end of the year to transfer money, so we are working very closely now that the leaders have endorsed this general concept to work out the details. There are steps that the European Union needs to take to make sure that the windfall revenues will remain available to service these debts. We are discussing the allocation of the loan among G7 members. These are very intense discussions taking place right now. Mr. Foster. Okay. If there is anything we can do to provide additional leverage in those negotiations, we are, on a bipartisan basis, willing to do so. Secretary Yellen. Honestly, this is a collaboration. The G7 is working together constructively. There are some complex issues here, but we are working constructively to get this done. Mr. Foster. And I would also mention that the $50 billion loan could be the first of several, that this is the first tranche and, if necessary, there could be more behind it? Secretary Yellen. Yes. Mr. Foster. How far can this strategy go and on what timeframe to support Ukraine? What fraction of the amount of money you get by simply seizing and liquidating the Russia assets? Secretary Yellen. We think all options should remain on the table, and the REPO Act is a---- Mr. Foster. But if you have to stick to this business with the loans and using the interest income, what are the limits to that? Secretary Yellen. We believe that a global approach strategy where the G7 and the European Union act jointly together is effective and appropriate. So, we are looking for strategies that other countries can also endorse and the issue of simply seizing assets, whereas we have been very clear that we believe there is a sound legal basis to do so in the United States and elsewhere. This has been something of a bone of contention, so the approach that the G7 leaders have endorsed is an alternative which doesn't raise all of the same issues as seizing the assets would, and it lets us act together as a coalition. Mr. Foster. Thank you, and keep at it. Mr. Luetkemeyer. The gentleman's time has expired. The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Williams, who is also the Chair of the House Small Business Committee, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Williams of Texas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Secretary, it's good to see you again. The last time you were here, I asked you what actions Treasury was taking to educate small businesses on their obligations regarding compliance with FinCEN's beneficial ownership information. And you acknowledged the burdens that small businesses will face with compliance surrounding this rule and committed to working with businesses to better educate them on compliance. However, from what I have been hearing from small business owners as I travel around, and being on the ground, is that they are still unaware of FinCEN's beneficial ownership requirements. FinCEN Director Gacki recently said that only 2 million small businesses out of over 32 million had filed beneficial ownership information. This shows that something needs to be done, because you cannot hold these small businesses responsible for something they have never heard of or are even aware of the rules of the road. My question would be, could you expand on how Treasury will work with small business to educate them on beneficial ownership? And is there any possibility for Treasury to provide more time for small businesses to come into compliance? That is important. Secretary Yellen. At this point, we are engaged--FinCEN is in a very broad outreach effort. It has received 2.7 million filings already. The filing requirements are easy to do, and FinCEN believes that the timeframe is adequate. The companies in existence before this year have until January 1st to file. But that is their current view. If things don't go according to plan, it will be considered. Mr. Williams of Texas. Well, small businesses are burdened right now, so please take a look at that. And the Biden Administration's climate agenda is forcing the IMF and the World Bank to take their eyes off the ball and channel resources and funding for climate-related projects and not projects that would enhance the overall well-being of a country or region. The World Bank is working to devote 45 percent of their financing to climate, and you are voting in opposition to any fossil fuel projects. Developing countries need access to electricity and other vital resources, not some unelected bureaucrats telling them that they can't finance an energy project in their country because it would support fossil fuels. Because of this, many developing countries will be forced to turn to Chinese financing. How is Treasury going to combat growing Chinese influence around the globe if your policies are enabling them to grow their influence? Secretary Yellen. What we see in countries in Africa and elsewhere is, for example, in Africa, you have 600 million people who don't have electricity at all, and actually want to use renewables to expand access and to address climate and to have systems that over time will be more secure and less dependent on fluctuations in global markets. And this is the strategy that they prefer. Our policy in terms of lending is that if it is not possible to use renewable energy--we want that to be looked at first--or if it is unduly expensive, we will vote in favor of projects that use natural gas, and, in fact, in those that have been presented, the great majority we have been supportive of. But climate is a very serious concern. In so many countries around the world, it is impeding the goals of sustainable development and poverty reduction. And it is a priority of borrowing countries as well as the World Bank and other MDBs. Mr. Williams of Texas. In business, you don't want to sell off an empty shelf, and you want to have products that people want to buy. So, I think we need to have all options available. There have also been developments at the IMF under the Biden Administration that I find extremely concerning, specifically the IMF proposed that billions of dollars in Special Drawing Rights assets be generally allocated as global membership. Now, this is alarming as hostile actors like China, Iran, and Russia can receive the funding to use as they please, all of which can be done without congressional approval. So, quickly, Secretary, you should be using your influence in the IMF to protect U.S. influence, ensure transparency, and prevent malign actors from exploiting resources. How could increasing IMF resources and allocating SDRs to China, Russia, and Iran affect U.S. national security? And what steps are you taking at Treasury to protect our U.S. interests? Secretary Yellen. We oppose allowing malign countries to use SDRs that they receive as allocation. We will not exchange them for dollars, which must be done in order for them to be used, and we work with other countries that have that capacity to make sure that it doesn't occur, and it hasn't occurred. Mr. Williams of Texas. Thank you. Mr. Luetkemeyer. The gentleman's time has expired. With that, we will go to the gentleman from New York, Mr. Meeks, for 5 minutes. Mr. Meeks. Thank you. Secretary Yellen, let me just say I greatly appreciate the work that you have done with the State Department, with the National Security Council, and with the whole Biden Administration in isolating Russia in the wake of its illegal, unjustified, and immoral invasion of Ukraine. Just yesterday, the Russians bombed the Children's Hospital in the center of Kiev with absolutely zero evidence of any military targets within the vicinity of that site. And then, I heard some Members of Congress rudely addressing you, talking about Russia when, in my opinion, what they should be talking about is the candidate of their choice, who has a bromance with Vladimir Putin, who gave away top secrets to Russia in the White House, who said that the Iran intelligence is better than the U.S. intelligence, who has said that he wants to be an ally and wants to emulate what Russia does with its parades and everything else, that he likes a strongman. So, they shouldn't be talking to you--a word about you and your policy. They better be talking to their candidate of choice as the rest of the world is worried about him being the President---- Mr. Luetkemeyer. Mr. Meeks, we just had this conversation a while ago. Mr. Meeks. Well, if you are going to do it, I have to come back---- Mr. Luetkemeyer. We had this conversation a while ago, and the conversation is that you stay away from the personalities and individual activities of the candidates, whether it be Mr. Trump or President Biden. Therefore, direct your comments to the Secretary---- Mr. Meeks. I am. Mr. Luetkemeyer. ----with the issues of the day. You are going into the personalities, sir. Mr. Meeks. Well, I am talking facts. Mr. Luetkemeyer. We have already gone down this road. We have already gone down this road today. It is going to stop. Go back to questions with regards to other issues that you think are---- Ms. Waters. Mr. Chairman? Mr. Luetkemeyer. Yes. Ms. Waters. The gentleman from New York was speaking about facts. He was not---- Mr. Luetkemeyer. He was getting into personalities. Ms. Waters. He was not making up anything. He was talking about facts. Mr. Luetkemeyer. I have ruled on how this is going to go, okay. Mr. Meeks, you are recognized for the balance of your time to address issues that are important to this committee with regards to the Secretary's responsibilities for today. Mr. Meeks. I am talking about facts here, Madam Secretary, and the record will reflect that. Now, I have two bills, Madam Secretary--and I think this is the way that we should look at that--that I believe would further strengthen sanctions on Russia, both of which have been sent to your team and have garnered broad bipartisan support, because I try to work in a bipartisan way, except when I hear the other side not doing that. Then, we have to make sure that we step up. One bill would sanction leaders of the Russian nuclear company, Rosatom, and the other bill would preemptively ensure that no People's Republic of China (PRC) or other foreign company could work to build a tunnel from the Russian mainland to Crimea. I am hopeful that we can do some work together to get those bills into law, and I hope that we can do it this year. But I know that you have put in a lot of work in this area, so could you just please discuss the work that you and the Administration have done to hold Russia accountable as well as its enabler, China? Secretary Yellen. We have been focused, even before Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine, when we realized that it was likely to happen, on creating the toughest possible sanctions regime that we could to deny Russia the military equipment it would need to carry out this war. And, as time has passed, we have strengthened our sanctions. We have sanctioned individuals, entities, and banking organizations, virtually the entire military-industrial complex of Russia, and have been seeking to reduce Russia's access to these goods that it gets from China and other countries that are suppliers. Iran is a supplier of drones, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). And we have an extensive sanctions regime which we are constantly tightening. Most recently, with respect to China, not only have we cracked down and placed sanctions on Chinese entities and firms that are involved in applying military-related goods, we have now gone after, with the President's new Executive Order, financial institutions that are processing payments involved in this trade trying to--basically threatening to cut off banks' access to the dollar-based trading system if they facilitate these transactions. And we have recently broadened it so that any foreign bank, Chinese or in other countries, that engages in transactions with any sanctioned entity in Russia, and that includes all of the largest Russian banks, Sberbank, VTB, and others, all of those financial institutions are subject to our sanctions. And we have put a price cap on Russian oil to try to reduce their revenues---- Mr. Meeks. You did a lot of work, and you are continuing to do so. I wanted to ask you a question about outbound investments, et cetera, but I don't have the time. Thank you for the facts. Thank you for the work that you are doing to hold Russia accountable---- Secretary Yellen. Thank you. Mr. Meeks. ----and China. I yield back. Mr. Luetkemeyer. The gentleman's time has expired. With that, we will call a stop to the hearing here with regards to the Secretary's wish to be able to stop at 1 o'clock. We are going to get you out, Madam Secretary, I believe, in time.
