BREAKING UP HEALTH CARE MONOPOLIES: EXAMINING THE BUDGETARY EFFECTS OF HEALTH CARE CONSOLIDATION ---------- THURSDAY MAY 23, 2024 House of Representatives, Committee on the Budget, Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to call, at 10:00 a.m., in Room 210, Cannon Building, Hon. Jodey Arrington  presiding. Present: Representatives Arrington, Norman, McClintock, Grothman, Burgess, Carter, Good, Ferguson, Roy, Moore, Estes, Fischbach, Brecheen, Edwards, Boyle, Kildee, Peters, Panetta, and Balint. Chairman Arrington. Good morning. This hearing will come to order. Welcome to the Committee on the Budget's hearing on ``Breaking Up Health Care Monopolies: Examining the Budgetary Effects of Health Care Consolidation.'' I would like to welcome our panel of expert witnesses: Dr. Chapin White, Director of Health Analysis at the Congressional Budget Office; Dr. Benedic Ippolito from the American Enterprise Institute; Dr. Adam Bruggeman from Texas, sorry-- that wasn't in the script, that just kind of came out--an orthopaedic surgeon at the Texas Spine Care Center; and then Ms. Sophia Tripoli, Senior Director of Health Care Policy at Families USA and a former policy analyst, also, I believe, at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. So thank you all for being here. Thank you for lending your counsel and your insight and we appreciate your time. Well, I am going to yield myself such time as I may consume for an opening statement. I will try to keep it within the five minutes. This is a very important topic and important to me personally. Our national debt is approaching $35 trillion. These are stunning statistics and should be sobering for every American. We are adding $8 billion to the debt every day. Our gross debt-to-GDP is over 123 percent, which is higher than it was when we were fighting a world war and we are in relative peace and prosperity. We are in a bad way in terms of our Nation's fiscal health and it is rapidly declining. Even worse, so far this year, we are paying almost 60 cents on the dollar just to service the debt. That is the interest on the debt which, by the way, this year will exceed what we spend on all of national defense. There are also payments thus far this year. Our interest payments to date, this year are more than we spent on Medicare as well as our national security for this great Nation. Hard to believe. In order to reverse the curse we must address the biggest driver of our debt: Federal health care spending. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office projects the spending on major health care programs will nearly double and grow from $1.7 trillion in 2024 to $3.2 trillion in 2034, three times larger in ten years, Federal health care spending, than what we spend on national defense. National health expenditures, which include everything from patient out-of-pocket cost to Federal and state spending on major health care programs, are projected to grow faster than our economy over the next decade, rising from $4.5 trillion or 17 percent of total economic output to 20 percent of our economic output or GDP and would be over $7 trillion. Health care spending is expected to grow at 5.4 percent over the next ten years while GDP is going to grow--projected to grow up 4.6. Simply put, this isn't sustainable for the Federal budget, it is not sustainable for patients, nor is it sustainable for our taxpayers. This hearing today is important. We are going to focus on one of the key issues plaguing our broken health care system and driving the increased Federal spending, which is increased consolidation in health care markets, ``Big Medicine'' as I like to call it. Big Medicine consolidation across health care markets ranging from hospitals purchasing independent physician offices--we will delve into that--to insurance companies acquiring pharmaceutical benefit managers and even pharmacies themselves down the supply chain, and then we have other trends, but the data spells out a troublesome picture of the current state of health care markets and the impact of consolidation on spending. In fact, CBO stated that consolidation has increased Federal health spending and cost for patients while limiting their choices and decreasing patient access to quality care. There were over a thousand hospital mergers between 2002 and 2020, and research has revealed the average price of hospital services increased in that period of time by $521 after hospital mergers occur. Additionally, 41 percent of physicians are now vertically integrated with a hospital or health systems, an increase of 12 percent over ten years. In cancer care alone, in cancer care alone, over 700 independent cancer clinics were acquired by hospitals over the period of 2008 to 2020. The cause and effect of this is clear. Prices for physician services in areas with high market concentration are between, statistically, 14 percent and 30 percent higher than in areas with less consolidation. In the prescription drug supply chain, 79 percent of all drug chains--I am sorry, drug claims are now processed by three pharmaceutical benefit managers, all of which are vertically integrated into large health insurance companies. This vertical consolidation, which some will say is greater scale, greater efficiency bringing costs down, is actually shifting incentives and increasing drug costs for Americans. The House Budget Committee and the House Republican Conference have been leading the way to combat health care consolidation through policies and our Reverse the Curse balanced budget, such as site-neutral payment reform, which is by the way, a Democrat and Republican idea. I think it actually emanated with President Obama, but we agree with it. Equalizing payments for the same service through Medicare site-neutral reform while ensuring our rural providers are unaffected is not only common sense, it would save taxpayers over $150 billion in the 10-year budget window. More importantly, this policy would end the perverse incentive that is leading to hospitals acquiring independent physician offices, leaving the market with less competition, patients with fewer choices, and then, most importantly, our reform would ensure seniors will pay less out-of-pocket costs, and we believe that is the bottom line here in terms of our success objective. Lastly, the House Republican Lower Costs, More Transparency Act passed the House in December. It not only includes transparency reforms to improve health care markets, it also included a site-neutral payment for Part B physician- administered drugs. So we are moving in the right direction in my opinion for sure. As Chairman I have made it clear this Committee takes its fiduciary duties to our taxpayer seriously, both Republicans and Democrats, which is why we are going to examine the effects of rising consolidation on the budget and discuss reforms necessary to reverse this trend, restore market competition, and reduce health care spending ultimately for the American people. That is what we want: access, lower cost. Nobody can afford health care at this point and I know we are all working towards that stated objective. With that, I yield to my Ranking Member and friend from the Keystone State for his opening remarks.   Mr. Boyle. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for holding this hearing today. When I first saw that you were holding a hearing called ``Breaking Up Monopolies'' I said, my God, Jodey is becoming a Democrat. This is great. I welcome with open arms the road to Damascus. But I have to say, I appreciate his thoughtful approach in general, but then specifically to this issue because it is so complex and, frankly, if there is an area that is hard to categorize as left or right it is the enormity that is our health care system. As we look and take a step back at where we are right now in the United States in 2024, when it comes to health care, there are some good news that I hope that we all should be able to cheer. First, the national uninsured rate hit an all-time low in American history last year with a record-breaking 21.3 million Americans signing up for health care coverage under the ACA. That is whether we call it Obamacare or originally Romneycare, the idea at long last has become popular and has worked. It is one piece of our rather hybrid health care system. Some people are on a direct government-provided health insurance such as the VA, some have health care-provided insurance through Medicare and Medicaid, some on the exchanges which, of course, I remind everyone again, pool together private plans, and then, of course, the biggest piece of all is the employer-provided health insurance. So we have had very good news. I hope people saw the New York Times article a couple months ago showing that actually, health care costs came down far greater in the last decade than anyone projected. So that is clearly good news that we can celebrate and that is why we can't turn the clock back and have to make sure that we preserve the gains that have been made. At the same time, as we take a step back and look at the whole system systematically, we spend approximately 17.5 percent of our GDP on health care in the United States. Germany, the U.K., Canada, France, they are all below 10 percent. So we are spending a much higher percentage of our GDP on health care than any of our peer countries and we aren't necessarily getting better health outcomes for those dollars. Why is that? How can we do better there in terms of getting, essentially, a better bang for our buck and bring down the costs? Now, as we move forward in looking at this, and specifically the consolidation in the industry that has happened over the last ten years, we have to realize it is not just patients that are affected by the industry, but it is providers and a lot of times it is physicians that are being affected, indeed adversely affected by this dramatic consolidation. You know, doctors who just want to be able to have a standalone practice are finding that more and more difficult. Theirs is a perspective that also needs to be listened to. It is obviously a crucial part of the health care system. So I hope this is the first of a number of hearings that we will have in this realm. We all know that as we look toward the early part of the next decade, we run into funding issues when it comes to the Medicare trust funds. We are going to clearly have to be looking at ways in which we can become more efficient when it comes to Medicare, yet at the same time, make sure that by a cut here and a cut there to physicians and doctors, we don't create a death spiral in which we reach the point where providers actually just want to opt out of the system altogether. Let's be wary of death by a thousand cuts as we are looking to making the Medicare trust funds solvent for the next generation. I am confident that we can do that. I end where I began: When you look at all of our peer countries that have different kinds of systems, U.K. and Canada is more a government-run. The government has the hospitals, the physicians are government employees. I think there are very few people in the United States who would think that that is an appropriate model for the U.S. that would work. You have other hybrid types of systems, though. France, Germany, Japan, where the government plays a stronger role in providing insurance for everybody, but it is the private sector. Doctors and hospitals are privately run within that system. Whichever model you choose, all of them seem to be spending less and are spending less on health care than we are in the United States. So focusing on what we can do to bring down costs, be more efficient, and ultimately provide better outcomes for all in the system, especially patients, is what we need to do as a country. And with that, I will yield back.   Chairman Arrington. I thank my friend from Pennsylvania, and in the interest of time, if any other Member has an opening statement I ask that you would submit it for the record. I will hold the record open to the end of the day to accommodate those Members who may have not yet prepared written statements.   Chairman Arrington. Once again, welcome to the witnesses. Thank you for being here. You will have five minutes to provide your opening remarks and then we will get into Q&A. Dr. White, you may begin when you are ready. I yield five minutes. STATEMENT OF DR. CHAPIN WHITE, DIRECTOR OF HEALTH ANALYSIS, CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE Dr. White. Thank you, Chairman Arrington, Ranking Member Boyle, and Members of the Committee. I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today and in consultation with the Budget Committee staff I have focused this testimony on consolidation among health care providers and its impact on the Federal budget. The markets for physician and hospital services have become increasingly consolidated in recent decades. The share of hospitals affiliated with a health system increased from 53 percent in 2005 to 68 percent in 2022 and the share of physicians employed by a hospital or health system increased from 29 percent in 2012 to 41 percent in 2022. The Federal Government subsidizes health care for enrollees in private health insurance and for enrollees in public programs and consolidation increases costs in both cases. Consolidation can affect the Federal budget by increasing prices in private health insurance, by increasing the intensity of services provided through public programs, or by shifting services to more costly settings. Consolidation gives providers more bargaining power, allowing them to negotiate higher prices with private insurers. Those higher prices increase private insurers' spending on claims, which in turn increases premiums. In employment-based health insurance an increase in premiums shifts a portion of employees' compensation away from taxable wages to tax-favored health benefits. That shift increases the Federal deficit. In nongroup insurance, higher premiums increase premium tax credits in the health insurance marketplaces. CBO projects that Federal subsidies for private health insurance will total $6.4 trillion through 2033, so even small changes in prices paid by private insurers could impact the Federal budget. In the fee-for-service programs in Medicare and Medicaid, the Federal and state governments set providers' prices through laws and regulations and managed care plans tend to follow those prices. So in that context, consolidation among providers generally does not increase the prices paid. However, consolidation can increase spending in Medicare and Medicaid by encouraging providers to deliver more services, to provide more intensive services, or to supply care in more costly settings. If hospitals acquire physician practices, certain services provided by those physicians may be billed at hospital outpatient rates, which include facility fees, and are generally higher than the rates paid to independent physician practices. Physicians whose practices are acquired by hospitals may send their patients to receive care in hospitals rather than in less costly settings or they might recommend more costly treatments. Those changes affect the Federal budget by directly increasing Medicare and Medicaid spending. CBO expects that providers consolidation will continue over the next decade. In 2022, the agency identified several policies that could reduce that consolidation, including further equalizing Medicare payments across sites of service and expanding Federal agencies' antitrust capacity. We concluded that adopting a broad set of such policies would avert up to a quarter of the growth in consolidation. We estimated that the resulting reduction in Federal subsidies for private coverage would shrink the Federal deficit in 2032 by 0.2 percent to 0.6 percent. The effects of the policy CBO identified would be limited for two main reasons. First, health care provider markets are already highly consolidated and undoing that consolidation would be difficult, particularly within a 10-year budget window. Second, some of the factors that drive consolidation are not amenable to change by legislation. For instance, providers might still seek to expand service lines or achieve economies of scale and providers would still benefit from consolidation because they would gain bargaining leverage with private insurers. CBO focuses principally on the effects of provider consolidation on the Federal budget, but policies that promote competition may have other effects outside the agency's purview, such as fostering greater patient choice or provider independence. Thank you. I look forward to questions.   Chairman Arrington. Thank you, Dr. White, and now we will yield five minutes to Dr. Ippolito. STATEMENT OF DR. BENEDIC IPPOLITO, SENIOR FELLOW IN ECONOMIC POLICY STUDIES, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE Dr. Ippolito. Well, thanks very much, Chairman Arrington and Ranking Member Boyle, and Members of the Committee. My name is Ben Ippolito. I am an economist at the American Enterprise Institute. Any effort to seriously address the long run fiscal imbalance is going to have to grapple with health care in the U.S. Current spending on Medicare/Medicaid and the ACA alone by the Federal Government exceeds the entire discretionary budget at this point, let alone other Federal spending, including what Dr. White was referring to in the tax exclusion and the cost of supporting the employment-based system. I want to emphasize the Chairman mentioned that we have accrued this debt in relatively placid times. I will also highlight we have had relatively slow growth of health care costs by U.S. historical standards over the last 15 years or so, with the exception of COVID. The fact that national health expenditures have hovered around 17 or so percent of GDP for more than a decade is historically anomalous, and so, if we resume more typical growth rates, the budget challenge is going to grow much, much more pronounced over time. Consolidation is, of course, one of many factors that leads to rising health care costs, and it does so in at least a few ways I will highlight. The first is that consolidation in many forms, including providers, but other forms--insurers, PBMs, things like that--tends to increase commercial health care costs. Those costs are reflected in premiums--higher premiums and lower wages that reduce income taxes collected by the Federal Government. The cost of that provision is over $300 billion today and every time commercial health care costs grow, the cost of that tax exclusion grows as well. Secondly, consolidation can increase spending in public programs directly, and perhaps most notably, Medicare pays higher rates if a service is delivered in a hospital outpatient department than a physician's office, and while that does make sense for lots of services, for relatively routine things that can be produced or done in a variety of settings, things like drug administration, that makes a lot less sense. That gives a major incentive for hospitals to acquire physicians' practices and bill at the higher Medicare rate. That directly increases Medicare spending, both to the government and to beneficiaries. It also has the effect of encouraging consolidation and increasing provider market power in the commercial space, thereby increasing commercial health care spending as well. There is a host of policies that can affect consolidation in health care markets. I am going to focus on sort of conceptual goals. The first is do no more harm. Try to end incentives that further incentivize consolidation in these markets. Dr. White already mentioned we are at a place where many markets are already relatively consolidated. Further consolidation is very painful. Things like the lack of site-neutral payments in Medicare or the structure of the 340B drug discount program are examples of program features that tend to reward consolidation. Another one that is not a single policy is administrative costs. Adding additional administrative burdens, reporting requirements that are onerous to physicians, tends to make it more challenging. It is easier for a large system to absorb those kinds of things efficiently than it is for a single standalone office. So anything that reduces those kinds of administrative burdens tends to help. Second, antitrust agencies have to at least be aware of concerning transactions and that includes the now-common situation where entities accumulate large market shares through many less transparent small transactions. That is somewhere where Congress can help those agencies. Finally, to the extent you can, there is value in trying to moderate how much consolidated entities can leverage their market power, and there are some contracting provisions that you can think about that tend to work in that direction. I am going to conclude with a pragmatic point, which is that efforts to address these issues often raise concerns about reduced access if they cause some financially vulnerable entities to close, particularly hospitals, and that is a real concern. However, I do not think that is a compelling argument for inaction. Congress can instead pass legislation that comprehensively addresses poorly designed incentives that encourage consolidation and, if needed, subsidize or help out those rural or otherwise distressed providers directly in ways that do not further incentivize consolidation. And so accommodating those kinds of concerns does not need to derail necessary work to try and keep Federal health spending on a sustainable path. I thank you for having me and look forward to questions.   Chairman Arrington. Thank you, Dr. Ippolito. Dr. Bruggeman, we yield five minutes now for your opening statement. STATEMENT OF DR. ADAM BRUGGEMAN, M.D., ORTHOPAEDIC SURGEON, TEXAS SPINE CARE CENTER Dr. Bruggeman. Thank you, Chairman Arrington, Ranking Member Boyle, and distinguished Members of the House Budget Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today on the critical topic of consolidation in our health care system. My name is Dr. Adam Bruggeman. I am an orthopaedic spine surgeon from San Antonio, Texas. I also chair the Advocacy Council of the American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons, and I am here to share my perspective of consolidation as a physician and an owner of an individual, independent medical practice. I have witnessed firsthand the alarming trends of consolidation sweeping across the U.S. health care system. From 2019 to 2021, there was a 25 percent increase in hospital and corporate-owned practices. Hospitals and large corporations are rapidly acquiring independent practices, undermining competition, and driving up costs for patients and payers alike. A mounting body of evidence reveals that consolidation drives up prices for health care services, including for common orthopaedic procedures like knee replacements and spinal fusions, which are approximately 30 percent higher in concentrated markets compared to competitive ones. Research also indicates hospitals engaging in consolidation impose prices 40 percent to 50 percent higher compared to what they would have charged had they not merged. The evidence is clear. Consolidation leads to higher health care prices and consequently erodes affordability and access to care. Allow me to further illustrate the cost of consolidation with an example from my own backyard. One of my colleagues recently joined a large hospital system after facing economic challenges maintaining an independent practice. This consolidation triggered site-of-service differentials and the financial toll was staggering in the millions to my community. One surgeon in one community costing millions in lost revenue to taxpayers, to local businesses, to employers, and this scenario is playing out in communities across our entire Nation. Consolidation drives up premiums for large employers in the area providing health insurance to their employees and leads to higher out-of-pocket expenses for individual patients needing surgery or other procedures. So what is driving this consolidation crisis? In today's health care landscape, physicians across America find themselves at a breaking point. Overhead costs keep rising. Our reimbursement keeps falling, and on top of that, we are buried under piles of bureaucratic red tape that pulls us away from patient care. Together these pressures make it extremely difficult for physicians to keep their independent practices afloat and lead many to choose employment over owning their own practice. The consequences of unchecked consolidation extend beyond higher prices for common procedures. Unfortunately, we witnessed firsthand the detrimental effect of consolidation during the recent Change Healthcare cyber-attack, which directly impacted my practice and exemplified how consolidation and vertical integration can amplify disruptions across the entire health care system. We are now seeing how concentrating more health care spending through a small number of entities can lead to singular points of failure. When an adverse event occurs at one of these consolidated giants, the impacts are more severe. They are more costly, and they are more difficult to resolve. To combat consolidation threats to affordability and access, Congress must enact reforms to overhaul how physicians are compensated. We are trapped in a vicious cycle. Rising costs and declining reimbursement are making it harder for physicians to keep our practices viable, pushing many towards consolidation, which then in turn drives higher costs for patients and payers. Unless we make long-term structural changes to how Medicare, and by extension the rest of health care, pays, values the services physicians provide, the idea of the independent physician will continue to fade from our health care system. For that model of health care delivery to continue to be a financially viable option for physicians we must have some form of long-term financial security that the current patchwork of annual short-term payment updates fails to provide to those who are not salaried employees of larger institutions. Congress also needs to repeal the moratorium on physician- led hospitals. Studies show that they provide the same or higher quality of care at far lower prices compared to nonphysician-owned facilities. Ultimately, any action must be coupled with broader reforms to stabilize physician payments long-term, reduce administrative burdens, and inject competition into marketplaces to empower physicians to thrive independently. Allowing these physicians to practice in the setting that is best for them, for their patients, and for their broader community should be the absolute hallmark of our health care system. With that, I urge the Committee to act and work towards solutions that promote competition in health care. The consequences of inaction are simply too high for physicians, for our patients, for employers, for taxpayers, and, ultimately, for our Nation's health care standards. Thank you for your attention to this critical issue.   Chairman Arrington. Thank you, Dr. Bruggeman. Ms. Tripoli, the floor is yours for five minutes. STATEMENT OF SOPHIA TRIPOLI, SENIOR DIRECTOR OF HEALTH POLICY, FAMILIES USA Ms. Tripoli. Good morning, Chairman Arrington, Ranking Member Boyle, Members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. On behalf of Families USA, a leading national nonpartisan voice for health care consumers working to ensure the best health and health care are equally accessible and affordable to all, I want to thank you for this critical discussion. No American should have to choose between going to see their doctor and buying groceries to feed their family, yet almost half of all Americans can't get needed medical care because of the cost. A third say that the cost of care prevents them from securing basic needs like food and housing and 40 percent of Americans face medical debt. As a Nation we spend more than $4 trillion per year on health care, yet the health of our Nation's families is suffering. Since 1960, total national spending on health care as a percentage of GDP increased from five percent to more than 17 percent and is projected to increase to 20 percent, or $7.2 trillion, by 2031. Health care now accounts for almost one-fifth of our Nation's economy, yet we have some of the worst health outcomes, lowest levels of access to care, and greatest inequities compared with peer countries, and nearly a quarter of a million people a year are killed by the health care system from medical errors, infections, and the like. Simply put, our health care system has lost its way. Our unaffordable health care spending is primarily driven by high and rising health care prices. We pay more than anywhere else in the world for prescription drugs, hospital stays, specialty care, MRIs, CAT scans, births, and time in the intensive care unit. These higher prices result in nearly $240 billion in waste annually to the health care system. Our Nation's high health care prices and abysmal health outcomes are the result of broken financial incentives that reward building local monopolies and price gouging instead of rewarding successes and promoting the health, well-being, and financial security of families. Health care industry consolidation has eliminated the competition and allowed monopolistic pricing to push our Nation's families to the brink of financial ruin. Nowhere is this clearer than looking at the price of drugs and hospital care, which together account for 40 percent of our Nation's health care spending. For more than a decade, drug prices increased 20 percent per year, far exceeding inflation, and since 2015, hospital prices increased 31 percent nationally accounting for one-third of U.S. health care spending, growing more than four times faster than workers' paychecks. These higher prices are passed on to families as annual increases in insurance premiums and cost sharing and become profit margins for large health care corporations. As a result, we cannot afford to retire when we want, buy a home, send our kids to college, or even meet basic needs like paying for food or rent. The successive spending has created an economic crisis for the Federal Government, state governments, and taxpayers, limiting our ability as a Nation to educate our children, protect our neighborhoods, care for our elderly, and build critical infrastructure like bridges and roads. But it doesn't have to be this way. We know what is driving the crisis and how to fix it. Solutions can be deployed right away to address the root causes of our Nation's affordability crisis by ending these pricing abuses and restoring competition in health care. This Committee is responsible for advancing budget priorities that reflect the values of families across the country and to invest in our country's future, build a strong economy, and protect and improve health care and other vital services for America's families. There is a bipartisan pathway to generate budget savings without undermining the promises to seniors, veterans, moms and babies, and people with disabilities. We urge this Committee to consider well-vetted bipartisan solutions to increase transparency on prices, health care quality, and ownership data; to address hospital billing practices and payment differentials that drive consolidation and increase costs; to limit anti-competitive behavior in contracts; and to strengthen FTC and DOJ enforcement of anti- competitive practices. I would like to finish my remarks with the story of Ben Los and his 5-year-old son from Colorado Springs to illustrate the impact of unchecked corporate health care greed on our Nation's families. In 2022, Ben and his wife rushed their son to the doctor after he began experiencing seizures. They were referred to a specialist in their network who ordered an EEG scan and assured them that the scan was covered by their insurance. Two months later, the Los family received a bill for $2,500. When they called the hospital to ask about the bill they were told it was a facility fee. The physician service was covered, but now they had to actually pay the hospital. Ben elevated the issue to the hospital administration leadership and was able to negotiate a reduction to his bill because it was classified as ``charity care.'' Frustrated by this experience, Ben investigated the hospital, but found it nearly impossible to determine who actually owned it. It was a giant black box. When he finally discovered the owner, he found that this particular system raked in billions of dollars in profits just in the first nine months of 2022, yet was claiming they needed to charge the Los family a $2,500 facility fee to pay their hospital staff. This is a national scandal. This Committee has a responsibility to put the needs of our Nation's families ahead of the greed of big health care corporations. I thank the Committee for your time, and I look forward to answering any questions.   Chairman Arrington. I thank the gentlelady, Ms. Tripoli, for her comments. Now we will move into the Q&A portion of the hearing, and I will yield myself five minutes. I find myself in an awkward situation here where I am agreeing more with the Democrat witness than maybe in any other hearing. Ms. Tripoli, I think you did, I mean, price transparency, market forces, healthy competition, and limiting those perverse incentives that restrict competition and choice for patients, and I am going to start with you. I am trying desperately to find consensus solutions that my Democratic colleagues can support, my Republican colleagues can get excited about with respect to a more efficient health care system on the Federal side. And there seems to be one big obvious one, and I continue to give President Obama credit for including it in his budget, and that is site-neutral payments. I just don't see any business person in America who would run their business with that kind of incentive structure where you are paying one entity more than you are another entity for the same procedure, same outcome, and in many instances, the same health care professionals because often those independent physicians and their health care group is gobbled up by the hospital that gets paid more in this scenario. This has been going on for a long time. We could save $150 billion, and we can reduce the cost, out-of-pocket cost for seniors, and we can just improve the system altogether. It seems to me the most obvious. Where are you on that? You were at CMS, presumably this neutral arbiter on what works, what doesn't work. You have seen a lot of ideas. Is this an idea worth us considering? Ms. Tripoli. Well, I certainly can't speak on behalf of CMS, but I can speak on behalf of Families USA and we absolutely support an enactment of a comprehensive site-neutral payment policy. MedPAC has been recommending one for years. It is very bipartisan. It is a no-brainer. It corrects a fundamental distortion, an economic incentive in the Medicare payment system, actually, that incentivizes hospitals to buy up physician practices, rebrand them as outpatient departments so that they can generate a higher reimbursement. And so that policy is all about ensuring you are paying the same price for the same service regardless of the location of where you get the service. As you mentioned, it is a huge saver back to the Federal Government and back to beneficiaries, and if it were extended into the commercial market there are also even bigger savings projected as well, but it is absolutely an essential policy, and we applaud the House of Representatives for enacting, or for passing a more limited provision, which is a huge step forward. Chairman Arrington. And let me be clear. Hospitals have their role. They need to be motivated and incentivized to do that very well. Physicians need to be motivated. The ecosystem has to work. Pharma produces technologies that save our lives and improve our quality of lives. Insurance can control cost. You know, I don't want to demonize any one of those groups, but their animal spirits in the private sector are going to pursue profitability and shareholder value. That is what they do. I don't blame any of them for some of the things that go on. I blame us for not having the right incentive structure. Incentives drive behavior. That is what we do as policymakers. Let's get the incentive right, let's get the behavior right, and the outcomes will follow, and it is unacceptable that this great country and our health system is the most inefficient of all developed nations. I mean, what the heck? Right? So, Dr. Bruggeman, with site-neutral, I quoted a statistic of 700 independent cancer clinics, just in the oncology space, were acquired by hospitals from 2008 to 2020. It seems pretty significant. Are you seeing this trend in your market there in San Antonio in the great State of Texas? Dr. Bruggeman. Yeah. We are certainly seeing consolidation and it is consolidation because of other consolidation. When the insurance carriers, the top three insurance carriers in the State of Texas control 82 percent of the market, well, what are physicians to do to try and contract and negotiate? They are going to have to consolidate. What are hospitals going to do, which only control 40 percent of the market, the top three only control 40 percent? They are going to have to consolidate. So we are seeing consolidation in response to the incentives, as you said, which is that they are trying to renegotiate their prices and ensure they increase with inflation every year. Chairman Arrington. So can I just summarize and tell me if this is the right way to look at it, the fact that there is a disparity in reimbursement and that with respect to hospitals and independent practices, physician practices, creates an uneven playing field and then the pressure is all the greater to not compete, and just, if you can't beat them, join them, again, which limits our choice and makes the costs go up. Is that a fair characterization? Dr. Bruggeman. It is absolutely correct. Chairman Arrington. Okay. With that, I yield five minutes to the Ranking Member for his questions. Mr. Boyle. Well, thank you and thank you to all the witnesses for being here and taking the time and your testimony. And thank you especially to Ms. Tripoli and your testimony for putting the human face on this conversation. Sometimes with all the facts and the figures it can get lost that we are talking about fellow Americans whose lives are upended sometimes by our health care system. In the spirit that the Chairman had with directing his first question to the Democratic witness, let me return the favor and direct a question to you, Dr. Bruggeman. While this wasn't prearranged, we both independently talked about the same thing in our opening testimony about the fee and the fee cuts within Medicare for physicians and for providers. I happen to be a cosponsor of H.R. 2474, which would index, it would provide annual inflation-adjusted payments to providers. It would provide that certainty. It would be indexed to the MEI, the Medicare Economic Index, in order to help physicians and, again, ensure they remain in the system and that there is certainty moving forward. I was wondering what you think about that approach? How necessary is it or not at all? And if you could speak more to that? Dr. Bruggeman. Yeah. I think we are at a critical juncture right now. The consolidation is occurring not because physicians want to give up their practices and become employed. It is occurring because they have no choice. We are not seeing an ability to look forward to our future and see where things are going in health care is going to be a good place for physicians. Right now if you are a physician, they are looking at getting less than inflation every year while your costs are going up. It just doesn't make any sense. Why would our best and brightest Americans decide to become doctors in the future? Who is going to take care of us as we go forward? We have to have some economic certainty to the future. We can't fix what we have done before. What happened before is what it is, but going forward we have to have inflationary updates. Mr. Boyle. Well, and you alluded to the consolidation as playing a role here. So it is a perfect segue. I wanted to bring in Dr. White. In your written testimony you shared the striking statistics. You talked about what a recent trend this has been over the last decade or 15 years. The share of hospitals affiliated with a health system increased from 53 percent in 2005 to 68 percent in 2022, and the share of physicians employed by a hospital or a health system increased from 29 percent in 2012 to 41 percent in 2022. And reading a little bit further along in your testimony, you predicted, or CBO projected that this trend will not stop and will continue. I was wondering if you could provide, you know, kind of meat on that bone and a little bit more about if we don't do anything what you would expect the next ten years to look like and where we would be in 2034 on the physician and hospital side and the further consolidation? Dr. White. We expect the trends that you just cited to continue and the forces are aligned for those trends to continue. There is bargaining leverage with private insurers. There is the lack of site-neutrality. There is 340B. There are administrative burdens that can be especially heavy for independent practices. There is pressure to join ACOs and value-based payment arrangements. So there are many---- Mr. Boyle. At roughly the same pace that we have seen in the last decade? Dr. White. That is our expectation. Mr. Boyle. I mean, to the best of, you know, your ability? Dr. White. Yeah. Yeah. That is our expectation. Mr. Boyle. And if you were to identify one thing, keeping in mind that the biggest enemy to the free market is monopoly, what would be just one thing, if you could, that you would recommend to Congress to focus on to attempt to disincentivize the drive to consolidation? Dr. White. So we would never recommend policy. Mr. Boyle. I know. Within your ethical constraints as CBO. Dr. White. Yes, but the policies that clearly play a major role are a lack of site-neutrality. That clearly is a heavy thumb on the scale. There is also just the backdrop of private insurers being in the position of negotiating prices with providers, and the bigger those providers are, the more of the market they control, the more leverage they have. That isn't really amenable to legislation. And there is FTC enforcement that is--the policy options are relatively limited compared to the underlying forces that seem to all be pushing in the direction of more consolidation. Mr. Boyle. You know, I just---- Dr. White. I want to make that---- Mr. Boyle. If you spare me here about 30 seconds or so I will conclude with one anecdote back from when I was a state legislator in Pennsylvania, and I am from the southeastern part of the state. This was in Western Pennsylvania. We had a major issue that concerned really all of us that in Western Pennsylvania, around the Pittsburgh area, you had one hospital system. You would know what I am talking about. I can tell. We had one hospital system that basically gobbled up every other hospital, and we had one mega insurance company that gobbled up every insurance company, and those two went to war with one another. So you had basically one behemoth over here on the hospitals, one behemoth over here on the insurers, and they decided to not basically recognize each other and get into this Cold War. Well, who lost in that Cold War? All of the people who lived in Western Pennsylvania, and it took, over a long period, frankly, government getting involved to end this death stare between the two behemoths. We want to make sure that never again happens whether in Pennsylvania or anywhere else. With that, I will yield back. Chairman Arrington. I thank my friend from Pennsylvania, and now yield to the Chairman of our Health Care Task Force and a leader on all things health care for the United States Congress, Mr. and Dr. Michael Burgess of Texas. Mr. Burgess. Thank you, Chairman. You know, I was going to let you go on another 15 minutes with that introduction. Dr. Bruggeman, thank you so much for being here today. I know how hard it is to take time away from your practice, but I cannot emphasize the importance of having a practicing physician on our panel. That is rare. We generally don't include practicing physicians, but you are on the front lines and you do interact with patients every day, and it is you more so than anyone else who understands that you are the advocate for the patient in this equation. There is no three-letter acronym who is in charge of you. There is no large Federal agency who is in charge of you, but you have to sit down and have that interaction with the patient in the treatment room or the operating room, and it is that service that you provide. Without the practicing physician at the forefront of our system, my thesis is it loses so much inherent good if it is we just turn it all over to the insurance company or worse. So thank you for being here. I know what a sacrifice it is and thank you for being on the front lines every day and taking care of your patients. So let's talk just a little bit, I mean, you are on the front lines. What is it that is the driving force that causes independent practitioners to give up and join into some large, consolidated group? Dr. Bruggeman. I mean, it is just like any other business, and again, thank you for your remarks, and I am more than happy to be here and testify on behalf of my patients and my colleagues. You know, any business you have got to balance the income and the expenses, and when your income is constantly going down and your expenses are constantly going up and you went into medicine to take care of patients, not to deal with administrative burdens, people just give up, and they say I am going to give up autonomy. I am going to give up control of my practice to let somebody else worry about the balance sheet and let somebody else worry about all these administrative burdens because I just want to get back to taking care of patients. Mr. Burgess. You know, interestingly enough, Scott Copley when he was at AEI years ago came and talked to our health care caucus right after the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and warned us about this legislation more so than anything else that has happened in his lifetime would drive consolidation in the health care space, and the results would not be good and now here we are 15 years later understanding just what it was he meant by that. But, Dr. Bruggeman, staying with you for a moment, you mentioned how--well, let me just ask you because it has kind of come up in several different ways, and I want to give the Ranking Member a chance to understand how important the concept of physician ownership and physician-led organizations in the health care space, how important that is in being a counterweight to the forces of consolidation. Dr. Bruggeman. Yeah. I think, obviously, physicians, when they start, we take this famous Hippocratic Oath that we are going to do good for our communities and for our patients, and so the critical piece of this is that physicians need to lead health care, and the fact that at some point in time we made a decision that probably the most important thing they could own, which is the health care system, the hospitals that we practice in and we shut that off and said that they can no longer own them going forward, or if they wanted to expand they can't expand them and compete. When we talk about consolidation, if you are able to knock out all of your competitors and not let physicians build hospitals, not let physicians expand hospitals, what is going to happen? We are going to see more consolidation in the hospital market, which is going to drive up costs, and we know from all the data physician-owned hospitals provide at least, if not better quality of care and they do it at a lower cost. It just makes sense to get rid of that ban. Mr. Burgess. Yeah. It absolutely does, and it is baffling to me during the coronavirus pandemic down in South Texas, Doctors Hospital Renaissance was unable to expand, even though they were the primary place that was taking care of the massive numbers of coronavirus patients. And I do wonder, Dr. White, why CBO has not recognized this, what Dr. Bruggeman just said? Dr. White. Thank you for the question. So on physician- owned hospitals we recognize there is potentially a price competition effect with the incumbent hospitals. At the same time, if physician-owned hospitals are allowed to open new facilities or expand existing facilities we expect that that would increase utilization and in a sense that is the flip side of the access. I mean---- Mr. Burgess. Well, let me just stop you there. You expect, but can you provide us the data? Can you provide us the models that you have used to make those assumptions? Because I think they are fundamentally wrong, and I would be happy to debate that with facts, but not what we expect will happen. I would like to see actual numbers on that. Mr. Chairman, thank you for your indulgence. I will yield back. I will have a number of questions I will submit for writing. Thank you. Chairman Arrington. I thank the gentleman from Texas. I now yield to my friend from Michigan, Mr. Dan Kildee, for five minutes. Mr. Kildee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you especially to the witnesses for being here and for this really important conversation. You are bringing to light, I think, many of the challenges that we face, and it is hopeful, or we are hopeful that we are going to be able to address these. People in Washington do tend to talk a pretty good game. I think it is more important that we try to roll up our sleeves and get things done. We did that in the last Congress. There is a specific area that I would like to focus on. We delivered on a commitment to do what we can to try to lower costs for Americans when it comes to their health care. Last Congress under Democratic leadership we passed the Inflation Reduction Act, a landmark legislation that included legislation that I had a hand in drafting to cap the price, the out-of-pocket price of insulin at $35 a month. It was originally intended for everyone, but then in this legislation it applied to seniors and allowed Medicare also at the same time to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. We got that done in the last Congress. As a result, Medicare beneficiaries are saving quite literally hundreds of dollars a month on insulin, something that is necessary to keep them alive. And once negotiated prices for the highest cost drugs go into effect, seniors who rely on those drugs will also see their savings grow. So for the seniors that I represent back home, especially those that rely on Social Security and Medicare to get by, that makes a real difference in their lives. Unfortunately, you know, there is some effort to go in the opposite direction. The Republican Study Committee, as I am sure most of the Members on this Committee know, have put forward a plan to repeal those drug pricing provisions. Obviously, our goal is to increase access to care, increase the quality of care, increase outcomes, and at the same time manage costs in a way that make it more affordable for Americans. So, Ms. Tripoli, I wonder if you might offer some thoughts on what the repeal of those very important provisions might mean specifically to Americans who are living paycheck to paycheck but also to our health care system writ large? Ms. Tripoli. Thank you very much for the question. I think repealing the Inflation Reduction Act or any of the suggested cuts to some of our most critical health insurance infrastructure in the country would have catastrophic effects for not only the affordability of care, which is the number one access issue that not just seniors but all Americans face right now in accessing their health care, but it would also have significant impacts on people's quality of life. We know that when health insurance is cut from people mortality goes up, and in terms of the Inflation Reduction Act in particular, as you laid out, there are really significant cost-savings mechanisms both to patients and the system. And if we want to get at the root of what is driving our Nation's health care affordability crisis, it is not a solution of cutting back on access to care. It is a solution of getting at the root cause which is prices. We have much higher unit prices for health care and drugs than anywhere else in the world, and it is so tightly tied to consolidation and the impact of consolidation on those prices. So real solutions that want to take on health care affordability should be focused on the root of the problem. Mr. Kildee. Well, I appreciate that very much, and, you know, obviously, we have got work to do dealing with some of these structural challenges. I hear from the physicians that I know as friends and that I see back home, a real concern that, you know, Doctor, you raised about the economic pressures essentially forcing physicians to make decisions that they otherwise would not make. So I appreciate that perspective. My point in my question is that while we do need to deal with these larger structural questions, there are things we can do that minimize the out-of-pocket costs for everyday Americans. We ought to be willing to pursue that. I know I saw one of my physicians this morning. I had my pupils dilated, and so I do appreciate the fact that you are all wearing these bright orange jackets this morning and the green hair really sets it off, so thank you very much. I yield back. Chairman Arrington. For the record, we will be the ones wearing the orange jackets by the time this is due. I thank the gentleman from Michigan, and now yield to my friend from North Carolina, Chuck Edwards, for five minutes. Mr. Edwards. Thank you, thank you, Mr. Chair. Dr. White, the National Council on Compensation Insurance found that hospital mergers can lead to operating cost reductions and lower patient costs for acquired hospitals of 15 percent to 30 percent due to an improved integration of care and a reduction in duplicated clinical services. And that is exactly what I and the folks in Western North Carolina were promised in 2019 when the largest health care conglomerate in our district, in my district, merged with another hospital. However, that couldn't be further from reality for the citizens of Western North Carolina. After the merger, prices shot up at the newly owned facility and were higher than the average list prices of the 11 neighboring hospitals and annual markup prices now average about 33 percent more every year. Based on your expertise, can you explain why that might have become the case? Dr. White. My understanding of the situation is that private insurers are negotiating prices with hospitals and the more hospitals consolidate, the more they lock down market share, and the more they turn themselves into must-have systems, the more insurers are at their mercy and are more or less compelled to include the hospitals in their network, even if it is at a very high negotiated price. So I think that is the broader dynamic that the situation you are talking about illustrates. Mr. Edwards. Thank you for that. Dr. Ippolito, did I get that close to right? Beyond the fiscal repercussions of health care mergers and monopolies, the citizens in my district have begun grappling with equally valuable but less easily quantifiable impacts of consolidation in regards to lower quality of care. While this metric can't be measured in dollar signs, it does have an equally tangible and important impact on the health care and quality of life for citizens in Western North Carolina. How would you recommend that we quantify quality of care? Dr. Ippolito. Well, that is admittedly much more challenging to do than cost but there has been a large literature, a large empirical literature, that has tried to do this, and they focus on a whole bunch of outcomes, mortality, but other much more less severe outcomes. And generally what you see is it is very, very hard to find compelling evidence that there has been a commensurate increase in quality that accompanies the increase in cost that we clearly see, and so while it is difficult to measure, the totality of evidence suggests that there is not clear evidence that it has improved. Mr. Edwards. So with your expertise, what do you view to be the most concerning non-monetary outcomes of health care consolidation? Dr. Ippolito. Well, I suppose if I had to rank order, mortality probably would be at the top. You know, it depends on the circumstances. It is kind of hard to say in general, but cost and mortality are the first things I would look at. Beyond that questions about access certainly come to mind, too. Mr. Edwards. So do you have any advice for how would you recommend that this Budget Committee and Congress leverage our resources to reduce these less tangible negative outcomes caused by consolidation? Dr. Ippolito. Well, the Federal Government, generally speaking, Congress specifically, has more ability to amend or change the public programs they have oversight over, and so I would start by focusing on every one of those program features that encourages greater consolidation and try to cut those off the best you can, site-neutral payments, 340B program, administrative burdens in the MIPs programs, things like that. That is where I would start. Mr. Edwards. All right. Thank you. Thank you all. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman Arrington. I thank the gentleman, and I now yield to my friend from California, Mr. Scott Peters, for five minutes. Mr. Peters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to all the witnesses for coming. As you have highlighted for the Committee today, the United States health care system has become increasingly consolidated with respect to insurers, physician services, and the hospital sector. For patients in San Diego and across the United States, consolidation and vertical integration often lead to higher costs and less price transparency, which we know is a really important aspect of competition in markets that are functioning. Facility benefit managers, or PBMs, for instance, talk about their ability to negotiate lower prices for patients, but too frequently PBMs pocket these discounts and they never make it to the patient. Ms. Tripoli, many PBMs, including the three largest, have vertically integrated with major health insurers. Why do you believe companies do this? What advantages do you think they see in consolidating? Ms. Tripoli. So part of, I think what PBMs are responding to is the significant consolidation there among drug companies and drug manufacturers. They are consolidating market power so that they can negotiate better prices and financial incentives for their own business practices. So I think in general the PBM pricing structure is very opaque, and as you have laid out, the incentive for them to negotiate lower prices is very, very minimal. Mr. Peters. Right. Ms. Tripoli. So driving more transparency around PBM pricing structures would be an important step for this Committee to consider. Mr. Peters. So thank you. I did support legislation like the bipartisan Lower Costs, More Transparency Act, which passed the House late last year, that contained rigorous reporting requirements for PBMs to prevent them from profiteering off state Medicaid programs and will help people understand better how they are directly increasing drug costs for patients. But I have some other ideas before the Energy and Commerce Committee about how we can keep working on PBM reform. I co- lead a bill with Congressmember Miller-Meeks that would ensure PBMs pass their discounts along to patients with chronic conditions. Ms. Tripoli, how should Congress keep working to prevent PBMs from taking massive profits at the expense of patients, pharmacists, and our health care system? What else would you like to see us do? Ms. Tripoli. So in addition to transparency, increased transparency across the PBM pricing structure, which is really key, we need a lot more data to understand what the negotiated rates are, what the list price, what their list prices are. It is, I would say there are opportunities for addressing spread pricing and ensuring that the rebates going back to consumers is a key piece. Yes, absolutely. Mr. Peters. Great. If the rebates go back to the people who need them, right? Ms. Tripoli. That is exactly right. Mr. Peters. Mr. Chairman, I want to just say two words about the context of this hearing, too, because, you know, there are a couple of things that drive this discussion that we don't talk about. One is the way we account for costs, which is this year's money. Imagine a family where the parents come back and they say we could save this family $10,000 by not fixing the roof, and then the first rain comes next year and you spend $30,000 on replacing the furniture. And that is the way we budget here. We look at this year's money. We give no credit for what today's investments might save us down the line. I want to thank Dr. White for his work in talking about the Baby Bear Project, which I will just introduce you to. Rady Children's Institute for Genomic Medicine conducted a study on infants where they did whole genome sequencing for infants hospitalized in intensive care, 178 critically ill babies at five hospitals across the state. They were sequenced to diagnose and guide personalized care which resulted in shorter hospital stays, fewer unnecessary procedures, and better outcomes for the children with their family. Saved $2.5 million in medical costs before you ever talked about lost earnings and all the things that would have happened had these kids not been fixed. This system is resistant to the benefits of innovation in terms of lowering costs, and I think we have to be aware of that, and we have to think about what the innovations that are coming out today at a very rapid pace, how they could be deployed today and how we gauge the benefits in the future, and that is something that we have talked about with CBO, but we have never really got there, and I think it would be really useful and more realistic in terms of controlling costs. The other thing is I want to say we are still talking not about a health care system but a sick response system. We respond to people being sick. If you look at the difference in childhood obesity between now and the 1970s, it is staggering. It is the difference between five percent and 30 percent. This is going to cost us a lot of money and we need to look not just at how we respond to these sicknesses but how we prevent them. Whether that is the food supply system or whether that is the level of physical activity that kids get, that is a huge impact on these costs as well and it actually drives a lot of it. I think we ought to be looking at that as well. Maybe a commission, Mr. Chairman, on dealing with these issues in a large way would be constructive, and I would just offer that again because we don't seem to do it here. I yield back. Chairman Arrington. I would agree with the gentleman and also say to my friend who mentioned a lack of logic between what we spend on the leaky roof versus when it collapses and the Preventive Health Savings Act that we passed on a bipartisan basis out of this Committee is one way to address that, whereby the gains may be outside of the 10-year window but it may be significant, and we need to flex on that, not just use this sort of cookie-cutter for everything. Mr. Peters. Mr. Chairman, if I might? Chairman Arrington. Yeah, please. Mr. Peters. Just to reemphasize---- Chairman Arrington. Please. Mr. Peters . The Baby Bear Project did that all within a window within a year and a half. So just we are not even talking about long, long term. Chairman Arrington. Yeah. Mr. Peters. There are a lot of savings we can get now. Thank you. Chairman Arrington. Yeah, I agree. I agree on both points. Now, we will yield five minutes to Mr. Ralph Norman from the Palmetto State. Mr. Norman. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I would like to thank all the participants today. Dr. Bruggeman, on a bigger scale, I think you all are, the physicians in the trenches are in a great spot to really make some changes, but it is going to take a lot of involvement. I think in a lot of cases, and I know in South Carolina I have told many of my friends in the medical field if--and I have been in on the development end then once I got in politics I saw what doctors went through from the political end, we are not putting the right people in office that will advocate for you. Everybody, when you are on the backside of the curtain listening, you all make $20 million a year, you drive expensive cars and live in 15,000-square-foot houses. Now, you need to-- at the bottom we can talk consolidation. We can talk things we are going to do, but it is going to take a massive change and you all are going to have to lead the way because you know exactly what needs to be done. In my world if I have a problem with a building I go to my carpenters that built it. You are the carpenters and so I would just urge more of your colleagues to get involved, and I know they are busy but at least have their staff because we didn't hear from the medical profession, so many things, and you all in such a good way can make a difference. This medical field is on a collision course. We can't afford it. The PBMs, we did two hearings on it, they are not going to give up their vagueness or their trying to decipher, you know, what the cost is. It is impossible, and they negotiate. They make huge money and just to get around the edges and find out what they are doing is almost impossible, but it is going to take you all helping us out to say, like, on the regulations that you are talking about in your world, tell us specifically what you need us to do in a priority list. You got people like Jodey and others who will tackle that, but it is going to have to come from you all. On the uncompensated care, the billions, I think in 2017 and 2018 it was over $40 billion for uncompensated care. That is on a collision course because that can't be sustained, particularly with the 15 million that are now in this country that are going to be in the emergency rooms, as was the other day when one of my staffers went. They couldn't get in because it was flooded. PBMs, what is your advice on trying to get the PBM crisis or, I guess, peeled onion back to find out what is actually going on? Dr. Bruggeman. Well, as an orthopaedic surgeon I don't deal with PBMs on a regular basis. Mr. Norman. Right. Dr. Bruggeman. I think there are some other experts on this panel that can probably answer that question better than I can. Mr. Norman. Yeah, Dr. Ippolito. Dr. Ippolito. You know, one of the ideas that came up earlier I think that probably would help is try to make sure that money that is supposed to be in some way ending up in the patients' sort of pocket actually gets there, and so I think one of the things you can do is try and get away from the current pricing system where we have really high list prices but where the insurer pays much, much lower net prices and the only person paying that list price is the patient paying out- of-pocket. It seems to me that is one of the big frictions and, frankly, bad features that PBMs seem to help facilitate that. That would be a step in the right direction. Mr. Norman. Yeah. You can't understand it and that is for a reason, and they promote the candidates that get elected who are going to leave it like that because it is a tremendous. Any other comments? Ms. Tripoli. No. I mean, I think the only thing to just add is there is a bit of an, you know, I think when we are looking at drugs we have to remember that, like, drug companies, drug pricings are mostly driven by drug companies, but PBMs, of course, have a role to play but there is the broken financial incentive in the PBM pricing structure which is why we need more transparency. They are financially incentivized to negotiate higher cost drugs onto the formularies because their revenue is based off a percentage of the rebates. So I think we want to--transparency is a really important piece to just pull back the curtain, as you suggested, and get underneath the hood, understand what is going on. Get more information, more data about the pricing structures so that we can have a much more effective targeted policy solution. Mr. Norman. I know one of the quickest ways we could make a dent in the health care controlling the price, put us on that plan. Let's put Members of Congress on and see how quickly it gets solved, because the VA has--I mean, veterans get some of the poorest care. They ought to be getting the superb care. So put us on the plan and I think maybe we ought to put a bill out that we do that. I want to thank each one of you for comment, and I yield back the balance of my ten seconds. Chairman Arrington. I would like to get that ten seconds back. That is first time I think that has ever happened. Mr. Norman, thank you for your input. Jimmy Panetta, five minutes for my friend from California. Mr. Panetta. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, appreciate it, and thanks for having this hearing, something that is so relevant to my congressional district out there on the Central Coast of California in the 19th Congressional District. So thank you to the witnesses for being here. It really has kind of reached a breaking point when it comes to health care in my district. I have got providers leaving the market and I have got patients unable to count on timely access to care. I think the thing that we can all agree on, patients and providers and Democrats and Republicans, as you are hearing, and my constituents and my colleagues here is that Medicare payments kind of are making the problem worse. The number one thing I hear in my district from providers and patients is that Medicare is just out of reach. Primary care providers are no longer accepting new Part B patients and specialists don't earn enough from Medicare to keep their practices open, let alone expand. This is all part of a bigger issue, as we have been discussing here, is the failure of Medicare rates to keep up with the cost of care. Now, I was proud to work across the aisle this last December with Congressman Greg Murphy from North Carolina on the Preserving Seniors' Access to Physicians Act, H.R. 6683, a bill that would offset the nearly 3.4 percent cut to providers in 2024. Now, we managed to get about halfway there in the final Fiscal Year 2024 appropriations package, but that still meant that doctors who treat my constituents saw another pay cut, payment cut. According to the California Medical Association, when we factor in inflation doctors will experience an effective six percent cut in 2024. Now, I know all of you, especially Dr. Bruggeman, it is clear that low Medicare Part B rates impact physician practices with consolidation, difficulty retaining staff, and, yes, trouble keeping the doors open amid rising costs. But if you could, Dr. Bruggeman, what should Congress be doing for this-- any long-term sustainability in Medicare Part B? Dr. Bruggeman. Yeah. I mean I think there are a lot of different issues at play. We have heard a lot of discussion about PBMs and potential savings there. We have heard discussion about site-neutrality and potential savings there. I just would encourage that those dollars go into restoring Part B payments to physicians to normal inflationary increases. There is just nobody who would stay in business if they made less money compared to inflation every year, and we have got to find a way to increase physician payment as it relates to inflation and use some of the savings from some of these other concepts to help pay for that. Keep some of the savings but use some of the savings to ultimately help pay for those physicians to stay into practice and stop consolidating, which is ultimately costing us a lot more money. Mr. Panetta. Yeah. Dr. White, is there anything else that you would add to that or anything different from that? Dr. White. Our sense is that the relatively low growth in Medicare physician fees is one factor and the uncertainty from year to year is one factor in providers thinking about independent practice versus being part of a system. But I would just go back to say that there are many factors other than just the fees. There is the desire for negotiating leverage from being part of a larger system. There are administrative burdens from MIPs. There is 340B. There are a number of factors. The other thing I want to highlight in the spirit of managing expectations is from the Federal budgetary perspective. If the fees paid to independent physicians are increased, we would definitely look at, is that going to keep more physicians in independent practice, slow the rate of consolidation? We would look at that closely, but I expect that by far the dominant effect on the budget would just be the direct increase in fees and Medicare outlays as a result. Mr. Panetta. Yeah, understood. Now, Dr. Bruggeman, you talked about tying in inflation, and obviously that goes back to the Ranking Member's comment about the Medicare Economic Index in which I think, what this March, MedPAC also called for indexing Medicare Part B to inflation and said Congress should finally raise physician care payments for calendar year 2025. The biggest obstacle to this effort is, as Dr. White just kind of talked about, is cost. It costs more money to pay providers what their services are really worth, and when we underpay them they go out of business or they just sell their practice. Dr. Ippolito, in 30 seconds, can you discuss how indexing would impact physician practices? Dr. Ippolito. Well, my expectation is that if you were to index payments to at least match inflation that you would likely increase participation in the program and likely on the margin increase the number of independent practitioners. I don't have a great sense of what the exact magnitude is but those would be my initial sense. Mr. Panetta. Great. Thanks again to all the witnesses. I appreciate you highlighting not just the issues, but actually bringing solutions to the table that hopefully we should be able to work on in a bipartisan fashion. Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Carter . The gentleman yields. The Chair now recognizes himself for five minutes for questioning. I thank all of you for being here. I am so excited. This is the most excited I have been for a hearing in years, in fact, in ten years since I have been a Member of Congress. As many of you know, I am a pharmacist. As many of you know, I am the one who had to go to the counter and tell the patient how much their prescription was. I was the one who had to watch a senior citizen make a decision between buying their medicine and buying their groceries. I was the one who saw the mother in tears trying to figure out how she was going to pay for the antibiotic for her child. And I wanted to do something about that, and I have worked in the Georgia state legislature and I have worked here in Congress for the past ten years to try to do something about that. I am so excited to hear that everyone at least knows what a PBM is now. When I came here ten years ago I would say PBM and people would look at me like I had a third eye. Well, that has changed now, and it is not just--and I really want to compliment the Chairman for calling this hearing and for the bipartisanship that you see here because as Representative Kildee said earlier, we all want the same thing. We want accessibility, affordability, and quality in health care. People on this side of the aisle, people on that side, everyone, everyone in this room. We want that, and we will make sure we get it, and it is not just in pharmacy. Yes, it is in drug pricing where you see where the insurance company owns the PBM that owns the group purchasing organization that owns the pharmacy that owns the doctor. Do you know who the largest employer of doctors is here in America now? UnitedHealthcare. Almost ten percent of all physicians in America work for UnitedHealthcare. I am just so excited to hear this. Dr. White, I want to start with you. We had a hearing-- excuse me, we had a Member Meeting of Energy and Commerce and we had the Director of CBO with us and we had about 20 of your staff members here and I asked this question, and I am going to ask you the same thing. Give me one example of where consolidation in health care has saved money. Dr. White. I can't think of one. Mr. Carter. Thank you very much for that. Dr. Bruggeman, I described how the insurance company owns and the vertical integration that exists, and we see it. Again, we see it in prescriptions and drugs, but we see it all throughout health care, and this is the biggest problem that we have got. Do you believe it is a conflict of interest for the insurance company to own the pharmacy, to own the PBM? Dr. Bruggeman. Yes. Mr. Carter. The vertical integration incentivizes the PBMs and its plans, not only that but it steers patients. Have you seen any example of patients being steered by the insurance companies? Any of you? Dr. Bruggeman. Yes. I mean, we certainly see that these insurance carriers will then steer it towards their own employed physicians or their surgery centers by providing financial incentives. Mr. Carter. All right, let's shift gears for a second. Dr. Ippolito, I am sorry, I know I butchered that, but nevertheless, 340B. You know, look, the 340B program is a good program. It was intended for the FQHCs. It was intended for those who need this program. It has evolved into something that it was never intended for, and the current structure of 340B, and have you seen it, Dr. Bruggeman or Dr. Ippolito? Have you seen where some of these health care systems are buying out practices for no other reason except to get the 340B pricing? Dr. Ippolito. Yes. I have certainly heard the anecdotes, but I have also seen research that suggests that specialties that prescribe lots of relevant medications that you get for 340B prices have been acquired by hospital systems specifically in keeping with that hypothesis. Yeah. Mr. Carter. And, you know, as the Chairman pointed out earlier, it is innate in all of us, particularly in capitalism, and look, I am not opposed to anybody making money. I get it. We live in a capitalistic society, and I understand that and it is innate in wanting to make a profit and wanting to get the lowest price you can, but this is not being passed on to the patient. Ms. Tripoli, you said earlier about transparency, particularly as it relates to PBMs, and making sure that the employer, the plan sponsor sees the discounts that are being given and sees where they are going and that the patient gets that discount. The patient receives it. Is that something you think would help? Ms. Tripoli. Absolutely. Mr. Carter. Good. One last thing, Dr. Ippolito, can you expand on the impact of consolidation on drug prices within the 340B hospital system and any negative impacts on the availability of provider services? Right now there is a study being done by the FTC that finally, I had requested it the first time I got up here, finally they undertook a study about two years ago, a 6B study, to see the impact that PBMs are having on independent retail pharmacy, which is impacting affordability and accessibility. Do you see this with the 340B program? Dr. Ippolito. At a minimum I think it is fair to say the 340B program is perhaps not as targeted towards the types of care that it is supposed to be targeted towards. Hospitals certainly made quite a bit of money on it. It doesn't seem like there is a lot of evidence that that is translating to the kind of care that you are referring to. Mr. Carter. Well, I don't want to abuse my time in the Chair and go past my allotted time, but I want to thank you all for being here, and I want to thank the Chair especially for this hearing. I have not been as excited about a hearing since I have been a Member of Congress in ten years. Folks, this is serious. This is a problem, and again, the bipartisanship you see here, everyone wants the same thing. We want affordable, accessible, quality health care. That is all we want. I will yield back. And at this time the Chair recognizes Representative Balint from Vermont for five minutes of questioning. Ms. Balint. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you to all the witnesses for coming today. As others have said, this is a really important topic to all of us. I thought I would just start by naming the elephant in the room. The United States is the only industrialized nation in the world that doesn't guarantee access to health care. And we have heard for years now many Americans have to decide between refilling their prescriptions, putting food on the table, and making other cuts in their budgets. They delay annual checkups and preventative health care visits and ultimately this costs the system more money in the long term and we get worse health outcomes. So I think any discussion about our health care system, which is, in fact, not a system, it is something that has been cobbled together horribly with duct tape and twine over decades, is not a system, and it is not serving Americans well. That is one of the reasons why I can't have a conversation about this without naming that we should have Medicare for all. Full stop. Everyone in this country, regardless of ZIP Code, should be able to get the health care that they need and we should finally put patients, finally, at the center of the equation. You know, we talk a lot about trying to find solutions and, in fact, we have had some wins and they have not fixed the system but they certainly have made things better. I just want to remind folks, and I don't want to go down a horribly partisan path here, but I just want to remind folks that many of my colleagues have tried to repeal Obamacare between 60 and 70 times. Between 60 and 70 times. The amount of time that was wasted trying to repeal something that was actually working to get more Americans health insurance, and I think we need to remember that because we all have a part in solving the problem. So let's not pretend that that didn't happen. Now, we also recently passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which from my count, not a single Republican voted for that, and again, it was to lower health care costs. It was to lower drug costs. So again, let's not forget that we have had opportunities before us to come together and, in fact, in those situations politics took the front seat over actually coming together to do some work on behalf of Americans. So that being said, Ms. Tripoli, I am so glad that you are here. I want to focus on an issue that is really concerning me in Vermont, and it is how private interests are playing into our system to treat opioids. Like many of my colleagues here on both sides of the aisle, we are dealing with a terrible fentanyl crisis, and according to a report from STAT News, ``Private equity firms have acquired stakes in nearly one-third of all methadone clinics in recent years,'' and in Vermont we only have six opioid treatment centers and the majority are backed by private equity companies. Ms. Tripoli, could you speak about the negative consequences of private equity stakes in health care providers? And specifically in the realm of behavioral health care, that sector, because we have an incredible need. We are not meeting the needs of patients in Vermont. Ms. Tripoli. Absolutely. Thank you for the question. I think we have to be extremely skeptical of the role of private equity in health care. Fundamentally, there is an incompatibility with a private equity business model and securing the health and financial security and well-being of the American people. By design the business model is you come in, you buy up a practice, you buy up a community-based provider, and you are trying to cut costs. You want to look more profitable in it, right? And so we see service lines being cut. So we see people losing access to care. We see an incredible increase in poor outcomes related to more increased falls, higher hospital- acquired infections, et cetera. So we see access reduced. We see quality going down, and sometimes the land that the private equity firms are actually buying up is more profitable than the practice itself and so they close it down altogether. So it has---- Ms. Balint. Can you say that again? Ms. Tripoli. Sometimes---- Ms. Balint. Say that again. Ms. Tripoli. Sometimes the land, oftentimes the land that the provider is sitting on that the private equity firm has bought is more profitable than providing the care in that community and so they close the facility down completely so that they can sell the land. And so, of course, that has catastrophic impacts for access to affordable, quality health care for all health care services in the community and, in particular, for people who need behavioral health services when we are in the midst of a behavioral health crisis in our country. Ms. Balint. I really appreciate that. I thank you so much for being here, and all the witnesses. And the last thing I want to say is health care should include mental health care. It should include behavioral health care. The body does not stop at the neck. Thank you. Mr. Carter. The gentlelady yields. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from California, Representative McClintock, for five minutes of questioning. Mr. McClintock. Thank you, Mr. Chair. First, one of my colleagues advocates Medicare for all. I would remind her that people spend a lifetime paying into that system before they qualify, and even so they will end up drawing about three times more out of the system than they pay in, which is why the actuaries are warning us that that system is in imminent danger of collapse, and I can't think of anything that would collapse that system faster with all of the elderly people who depend upon it than what the gentlelady has just advocated here. The State of California, which is the most radical-left state in the country, has several times considered providing a Medicare for all at the state level and blanched at that at the price. Dr. Ippolito, the two sectors of the economy where prices have increased much faster than inflation are tuition and health care. Why is that? Dr. Ippolito. Well, you know, I am not an education economist, but there are certainly some similarities. Among other things they are fairly heavily federally subsidized, which lowers the costs. Mr. McClintock. We pour tons of money into it and they are happy to accept it. Is that essentially what is going on? Dr. Ippolito. I think one could characterize that as a factor, yeah. Mr. McClintock. Let me read you something that Milton Friedman wrote 23 years ago. He said, ``Since the end of World War II, the provision of medical care in the United States and other advanced countries has displayed three major features. First, rapid advances in the science of medicine; second, large increases in spending, both in terms of inflation-adjusted dollars per person and the fraction of national income spent on medical care; and third, rising dissatisfaction with the delivery of medical care on the part of both consumers of medical care and physicians and other suppliers of medical care.'' Have things gotten better or worse since he wrote that in 2001? Dr. Ippolito. It would be a tough case to say it has gotten much better. We have had many advances, many technological advances, but---- Mr. McClintock. In the technology, but as Milton Friedman also pointed out, ``In every other sector as technology advances prices go down.'' Has that been the case here? Dr. Ippolito. No, not in general. Mr. McClintock. So spending has gotten higher, dissatisfaction with the system has obviously gotten greater. If that is the case, despite massive increases in government spending and regulation, maybe that is what is causing it. All this government intervention and spending that has made costs higher and services worse. That shouldn't surprise us. That is what socialism always produces, higher costs and worse services. Let me ask you this. What role does illegal immigration play in driving up health care costs? Dr. Ippolito. You know, I am not an expert on this issue but the key things that you would have to think about are what kind of resource use do you see among that population and how much does that cost? Mr. McClintock. Well, let me tell you what they are because the Federation for American Immigration Reform just released a report on that. We had a hearing on it just a week or so ago, estimating the cost of care for illegals is about $22 billion a year. Who ends up paying that $22 billion price tag? Dr. Ippolito. Well, some combination of the people who receive services, the Medicaid program potentially, and then providers and the Federal Government in the form of uncompensated care. Mr. McClintock. Before we socialized our medical system we had a free market system which every American could choose from a wide variety of competing options, the one that best met their own needs and budget. They owned these policies. They could change them at will if they became dissatisfied with their coverage, and they had a huge incentive to live healthier lives. For example, an obese smoker paid higher premiums than someone who kept himself healthy. An elderly couple wasn't forced to pay for maternity care. A young family could choose to purchase low-cost catastrophic insurance and then pay for incidental expenses out-of-pocket. So explain to me why we shouldn't just start over, scrap this entire mess of a system, allow people to deduct their health costs from their taxes, provide the poor with a minimum subsidy to assure that every family can afford at least a basic plan, allow consumers to shop across state lines, restore the freedom of people to choose the level of coverage that best meets their needs and budget that they can change anytime they become dissatisfied? Wouldn't we quickly return to a situation where we had a wide variety of plans and prices that consumers could choose, health care providers that are attentive to consumer demands in a highly competitive environment, and cost just a fraction of what we are paying today? Dr. Ippolito. There are certain features of that that I think would be a real step in the right direction. Focusing more on ensuring rare, very expensive things, I think, is a reasonable goal. There are trade-offs associated with that, but I think there are some reasonable points there. Mr. McClintock. Thank you. I see my time has expired. Mr. Carter. The gentleman yields. The Chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Minnesota, Representative Fischbach, for five minutes of questioning. Mrs. Fischbach. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Most of the hospitals and nursing homes in my district have integrated with larger systems in one way or another and they mainly serve communities of fewer than 5,000 people. This helps to preserve access to health care in those communities. In fact, I have one facility in a town of just 700 people that is part of a large hospital system. It is a vital part of the community and the surrounding area. The impact of care that the facility provides extends for miles, and it exists solely because a larger company has the capability to support them. These hospitals are an extension of services provided at a larger hub, spreading their expertise to even the most remote parts of the state. The work that they do is vital. Additionally, with the rise in telehealth options, larger companies are in the best position to finance a cybersecurity system to protect patient information. I acknowledge that health care costs are high, but access to high-quality care, especially in rural communities like the ones I represent is critical. People living in rural communities should have access to health care. Is there a plan to preserve and enhance health care in rural areas? Rural communities deserve access to health care and the ability to benefit from the same medical advances that are developed in this country's top hospitals. We cannot suffocate innovation and we cannot hinder the care that is available to rural communities across the country. Overregulating the care of those with no other option is no way to cut costs. We need to develop policies that will help all of our hospitals thrive. We need to support American health care innovation and expand the reach of expertise to bring lifesaving care to folks who are far away from their nearest hospital, and before we go after one aspect of the health care system, we cannot overlook the issue of access of care especially to those rural areas. Would anyone like to address that issue? Have we looked at that? Have we talked about making sure that people in remote rural areas have access to care? Anyone who would like to respond? Ms. Tripoli. I will say, first of all, absolutely. Making sure that all people living in this country have access to high quality affordable care is paramount. I think the challenge with the rural community sometimes is the economics for those provider systems are different than those in more urban areas, and so I think that when we are talking about solving for those economics we need a very specific set of solutions for rural providers so that they can keep their doors open, they can be sustainable financially, and continue to serve the patients and their communities, continue to be a really important source of jobs. Having them close their doors is not ideal. At the same time, we do know that we have to correct some of these fundamental challenges in these financial incentives that are encouraging consolidation, and so it is not that it is all bad, but the vast majority of hospitals are responding to a financial incentive in the Medicare program that is encouraging to continue to consolidate. So we have to address that problem. It is hugely wasteful. It is shifting patients to higher cost care settings. It is driving up the cost of care for everybody. So it would be a both/and for us. Mrs. Fischbach. All right. Then whatever we do and when we talk about this we need to address those folks in rural areas because we are talking about these broad things and saying this is horrible, this is horrible, this is horrible, but those people not having health care, not having access to health care, and they are already driving hours for the most basic care. That is horrible. That is horrible and it is not right, and we need to make sure that we are addressing that, and that is one thing that I have not heard about today is we are not talking about access. We can talk about all of the other things, but when it boils down to it, it is about people having access to health care. If you have something to add? Ms. Tripoli. Yeah, I just want--I completely agree with you. Could not agree more. One of the things we can do when we are talking about site-neutral payments, because that is such a bipartisan solution here today that we have been talking about, is reinvest. There is about $150 billion to $160 billion in savings and some of that savings can be reinvested back into rural providers to make sure that they stay whole. Mrs. Fischbach. Well, these larger companies are the ones that are preserving access to my folks that live in rural areas and they are making sure that they have health care. So let's make sure that we recognize that also when we are having these discussions. I have seven seconds if you have something, Doctor? Dr. Bruggeman. I would just add that physician-owned hospitals are currently banned and there is nothing that says that physicians could not invest in their own communities and build those facilities that would provide the critical access, and we would definitely encourage expanding the rights to own your own facilities as a physician in those rural areas to continue to expand the access and care as well. Mrs. Fischbach. Thank you for that, but I just really--we need to recognize that it is about access, also, and that we cannot always just say this is how we cut costs because we have to recognize that rural people who live in rural areas need access. And with that, Mr. Chair, I yield back. Mr. Carter. The gentlelady yields back. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin, Representative Grothman, for five minutes of questioning. Mr. Grothman. Thank you. Whenever I think about this topic I think about a physician friend of mine who told me that he felt medical care in this country peaked out about seven years ago. He attributed it in part to all these consolidations which makes medical care even more impersonal and profit-driven than it already would have been, plus the seeping of this DEI stuff both into the colleges and into the medical facilities themselves. In any event, whenever we talk about this topic one of the things that I think of is differences in how we treat people and how some procedures seem to be done more in one facility than in the other facility. Years ago they always used to talk about C-sections, the tremendous variance from doctor to doctor and hospital to hospital. Do you want to comment on that a little bit and give me some other examples where you feel procedures vary from hospital to hospital, system to system, part of the country to part of the country? Dr. Ippolito. I can speak generally to that in the sense that there is a longstanding empirical literature that looks at the Medicare program, fee-for-service, and what you see is that there is enormous variation across the country in both how much Medicare spends and in particular, utilization across the country. And it is clear that there are some areas that on specific services and more generally deliver much, much more care than other places. So it is clear that there is a lot of variation along these lines. Mr. Grothman. And by more care you mean more procedures? Dr. Ippolito. Exactly. Mr. Grothman. And do you think that, and I would assume that it is driven in part, it is profit-driven? The more you do the more you make? Dr. Ippolito. Yeah, particularly in the Medicare fee-for- service program you can't increase price so what you can do is deliver more services. Mr. Grothman. Do more stuff. I think you were going to say something right there at the end? Ms. Tripoli. No, just generally agree with that comment. Mr. Grothman. Okay, next comment. I was looking here at what administrators make. I mean, it is just obscene, you know, compared to, I think, what they were making 20 years ago. Anybody want to comment? I am sure overall that it is a small cost of medical care, but when you see people making $10 million, $20 million a year, you know, nobody should make that sort of money unless you, you know, discovered something or other that is saving lives, but anybody want to comment on the cost of what administrators make and what it is now compared to 20 or 30 years ago? Dr. Bruggeman. I mean, I would certainly say that that is one of our biggest concerns, is that a lot of the dollars are being diverted that are being paid for in health care to the salaries of people who do not actually add to the bottom line, instead shifting the money towards the things that actually provide the people that provide the care and the things that provide the care. Mr. Grothman. Absolutely, baby, and when you get in these hospitals, do you know how much they spend in a hospital for people who never deal with a patient? Is there anybody with those statistics? I mean, not only do you have the overpriced administrators, which is criminal enough, but when you go into a hospital you see all sorts of hardworking people staring into their computer screens but have nothing whatsoever to do with medical care. Is that a problem do you think? Dr. Bruggeman. I would just tell you that right now in my own personal practice we--because of the regulatory requirements, over a third of my staff's time and money is spent purely on non-clinical work trying to respond to various regulatory burdens. Mr. Grothman. Okay. Does anybody want to comment on the effect--we recently had a major consolidation that affects the hospitals in Milwaukee and they, you know, were connected to some outfit down in the southeast. Does anyone want to comment in general on the effect these massive behemoths being formed, have both on the cost and also on the quality of care? Because I would think the more impersonal you are the more you are just worried about dollars and that sort of thing, and I know doctors hate them. Every doctor I know hates them. Anyone want to comment on them? Dr. Ippolito. I guess I could say that there has been research that looks into, you know, a lot of the focus is on when two very nearby hospitals merge and obviously that leads to higher prices and more administrative costs, things like that. There is also research that shows that even when these hospital systems merge and they are not next door to each other, you tend to see higher prices because still the employers have to negotiate in Madison and Milwaukee, and so the fact that the two hospitals in both those cities might be owned by the same entity ends up mattering quite a bit. Mr. Grothman. Okay. I want to come back to what you were referring to as utilization. Are you aware of anywhere where we can just get those statistics? I mean, the reason I say is I think they even do more surgeries than some physicians and others and whatnot and there is always a damage in surgeries. There is always a danger of getting infected or die or something or other. And I think the public would love to know if, you know, if I am going to a conglomeration or I am in a part of the world where they do way more whatevers than they do in Pennsylvania or something. Actually, I think it is the other way around. Probably do way more in Pennsylvania, but do you think it would help if that were more publicized and maybe some patients themselves that say, hey, I don't want to go into one of these killing factories, that is an author I like, killing factories, if I don't have to and how come we are doing so many of these things here but aren't doing them in---- Dr. Ippolito. It potentially could, and I would be happy to send some of the evidence on that. Mr. Grothman. Wouldn't that be helpful? Because I think a lot of people don't like to go under the knife and they don't realize that their doc is just way out of whack with the rest of the country. You wanted to say something at the end there? Ms. Tripoli. Sure. I was just going to say that I think one of the things you are talking about is the predominant way that we reimburse for health care physician services in this country is fee-for-service, and those economics, fee-for-service economics, by design incentivize higher volume of higher cost service. Mr. Grothman. Exactly. Ms. Tripoli. So I think if we want to shift away from that we have to think about other---- Mr. Grothman. Exactly. Ms. Tripoli . Types of reimbursement structures that we can use that drive more towards affordable population health improvements. Mr. Grothman. Yeah, that is exactly right. The more you do the more you make, right? Isn't that kind of the problem? Absolutely. Thank you. Mr. Moore . I appreciate the animation of the gentleman from Wisconsin. Got a new Chair up here. We are going to get this a little more lively. The gentleman from Wisconsin's time has expired. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Roy, for five minutes. Mr. Roy. I thank the gentleman from Utah. I appreciate all the witnesses. Dr. Bruggeman, it is great to have you here from San Antonio. I will be in San Antonio tomorrow to celebrate, hopefully, a new direct flight from DCA to San Antonio which makes it easier for people to get up here, which is great. But appreciate all your time. I have a couple things we haven't talked about in this hearing so far. One of them is the proposals for transparency, lower costs as a result of greater transparency. I think most people, I think on both sides of the aisle, would say transparency is probably good to improve. I think my question here, I guess, and I will start with you, Dr. Ippolito, is how much do we think that whether it is the Lower Costs, More Transparency bill or some product similar to it, will be able to make a sort of meaningful difference in lowering premiums, lowering deductibles, lowering the general cost of health care services absent more structural and fundamental reform? In other words, how much is that just, you know, I think I have said before, you know, patching the drywall with some mud and some tape, but not actually changing the foundational problems? Again, not to criticize any efforts there, but rather to say absent structural reform on who is buying and selling goods and services and consolidation, are we going to get a meaningful, significant drop in prices or modest drops in prices under some proposal like that? Dr. Ippolito. Yes. So one way to think about is two things can be true. It can be true that greater transparency, for example, into PBMs, might help employers pick plans better and save some money. It can also be true that what you are saying is, you know, if there is only one hospital in town the fact that you know their price now doesn't really change anything, and so, yes, we are more in the modest zone. Mr. Roy. And even talking about PBMs, for example, right, 79 percent of prescription drug claims are processed by only three PBMs. Does that sound right to you? Dr. Ippolito. Yes it does. Mr. Roy. Is that good? Dr. Ippolito. It is probably not great. Mr. Roy. Yeah, I mean, I think this is what I am trying to get at is, like, we have largely, and I will opine here and you can agree or disagree, destroyed the market and competition. So when my colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about, oh, the Wild, Wild West--I actually had a debate one time with a left-leaning progressive activist in Austin, Texas, and she described the Wild, Wild West of health care and talked about the Wild, Wild West prior to Obamacare and all that, and I am, like, if the alphabet soup of regulation is the Wild, Wild West, then I could see why you think that is a problem, but it is not free market. It is not free enterprise. It is not competition. Would you agree that there is a fundamental lack of competition to drive prices down? I mean, the gentlelady from Minnesota was talking about access and talking about, you know, well, we don't want to get too caught up on cutting costs or prices or whatever. If you don't get prices down can you have legitimate access to health care? Dr. Ippolito. First off, I agree with your conjecture that we really do not have a private--and we never really did--have a private system. We had a heavily regulated market. But it is one way to put it, it is extremely expensive to insure and expand access if you cannot do anything about prices that are currently paid. Mr. Roy. Dr. Bruggeman, how can we make it easier, and short answer because it is open-ended, but, like, just being very specific, how can we make it easier for you to cut insurance, other third parties, government out entirely so that you can run your business and practice? And one quick follow-up, you said something about no, there not being a ban on physician practices. There is a restriction post-Obamacare on future physician practices, right, as opposed to, you know, grandfathering out past physician practices. Is that correct? Dr. Bruggeman. There is both. The current ones cannot expand and new ones cannot be built for physician-owned hospitals. Mr. Roy. Right. Right. Dr. Bruggeman. I mean, the answer is, number one, give us a financial future. Show us a glimmer of hope for the future. Show us that we can get our pay tied to inflation. Number two, reduce our regulatory burdens and you have heard that across the table. There is too much regulatory burden currently so how do we get rid of that so that we can just focus our efforts and all of our money on providing care as opposed to all of this money that is currently being spent behind closed doors working on various regulatory efforts. Mr. Roy. Dr. Ippolito, just a couple of questions kind of on a rapid fire since I only have about a minute. Do these sound right to you roughly, that premiums have increased by 54 percent since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare? Dr. Ippolito. I wouldn't be surprised if that is correct. Mr. Roy. Do United, Anthem, and Humana receive a majority of their revenue from the Federal Government? Dr. Ippolito. That sounds plausible. Mr. Roy. To the best of your knowledge, is it correct that there were about a thousand hospital mergers between 2002 and 2020? Dr. Ippolito. That sounds right. Mr. Roy. To the best of your knowledge, is it correct that 10 percent of all physicians in America now work for an insurance company? Dr. Ippolito. Yep, that does. Mr. Roy. And growing? Dr. Ippolito. Yes. Mr. Roy. Do hospital prices after mergers generally go up one percent to two percent at least $500 rather than going down based on, you know, some cost savings from the merger? Dr. Ippolito. Yes. There is extensive evidence on that one. Mr. Roy. Is national health spending at an all-time high of about $4.5 trillion in 2022 and growing? Dr. Ippolito. Yep. That is correct. Mr. Roy. Are you aware that almost a billion dollars, does this sound right, that between $750 million and $1 billion have been spent by health care in lobbying the Federal Government in the health care industry across sectors? Dr. Ippolito. While I don't know the exact number I know it is a very large number. Mr. Roy. Okay. I am over my time. I know the Chair has been generous in allowing some folks to go over their time. I want to be mindful of the witnesses' time so I will leave it there. I want to thank each and every one of you. I started to ask questions of all four of you. I wish we had a little bit more time. I think this has been an important hearing. We need competition if you are going to get prices down. I don't care whether you are right, left, Democrat, or Republican, we are not going to be able to have health care if you can't get prices down through competition and empower doctors, patients, not big corporations, in the form of insurance companies, hospital companies, and Pharma. We have got to restore power to patients and doctors, and I think consolidation is a problem and also freeing up people through health savings accounts is a problem. I appreciate it. I yield back. Mr. Moore. Thank you to the gentleman from Texas, we need to treat consumers like we treat consumers in every other industry almost in this Nation and trust the fact that they can make some of their own decisions based on information that they have to make a thoughtful decision. Thanks to the gentleman from Texas for highlighting some really key points. I now yield five minutes to the gentleman from Kansas, Mr. Estes. Mr. Estes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for calling this hearing, and then thank you to all of our witnesses for being here. You know, today I just left the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee who is holding a hearing on a very similar topic, and a physician from Wichita was one of the witnesses, so I am keenly aware of the bureaucratic red tape, the lower reimbursement rates, the rising prices, and the impact that they have on independent physician practices, and that we are seeing private practices close or consolidate as a result. As I have spoken with patients and providers and physicians and support staff throughout Kansas, consolidating or closing practices is not helping Kansans receive quality health care. With fewer and fewer doctors and nurses in private practice, patients are seeing increased costs and worse outcomes. The Kellogg School of Management notes that prices increase about 14 percent when a private practice is acquired by a hospital, and a National Opinion Research Center survey found that 45 percent of physicians report deteriorating patient- provider relationships after consolidation. Increased costs and diminished outcomes are not the recipe for a healthy society. Dr. Bruggeman, in recent years we have seen a significant decline in the number of independent physician practices and an increase in the number of practices owned by hospitals and health systems. Based on your experience as a practicing orthopaedic surgeon, what incentives do you see in the marketplace for physicians to sell their practices to hospitals and health systems? Dr. Bruggeman. Yeah, I think it is two things. It is economics and getting back to taking care of patients. The economics are not in our favor in private practice and they are in our favor and a guaranteed salary that someone else is responsible for. And then we are trying to spend more time taking care of patients and by selling your practice you offload that regulatory burden to another entity who now takes it on for you, and so physicians are theoretically able to spend more time taking care of patients and that is why they are giving up control of their practice. Mr. Estes. Yeah. You noted in your testimony that the cost for procedures commonly conducted in your practice would increase approximately 30 percent in concentrated markets compared to more competitive ones. What causes prices for the health care services in consolidated markets to be higher? Dr. Bruggeman. It is the bargaining power that those consolidated groups have. They are able to ensure higher payments because they are in a larger group. Mr. Estes. And those are some of the issues I think that several of my colleagues have talked about today in terms of the impact and as my friend from Texas just went through a whole litany of some of the concerns over the last few years. Again, based on your experience as an independent physician, what consequences are there for patients, the local community, Federal and state budgets when independent practices are acquired and the cost of health care goes up? Dr. Bruggeman. In my community we had a group that decided to sell to a local health care system. One of our largest employers is the grocery store so what that is going to mean for every single person in my community is higher grocery prices because those costs are ultimately going to have to be passed along to our community. And so it is an access issue where people have a harder time getting their doctors. They are not able to get primary care physicians, and then it becomes a cost issue where we have to pay more for goods, not just for health care but for goods in general as these consolidations occur. Mr. Estes. Yeah. Well, I just want to thank all of you panelists for being here. Obviously, this is an issue that is of paramount importance for our country. I mean, because it doesn't just affect individuals, but it affects, as we talk about from the Budget Committee side, the concern about our debt and deficit for the country. Obviously, we want a vital, vibrant health care system to support all Americans in their health care needs, but we also need to make sure that it is affordable and that the processes work. Mr. Chairman, I really appreciate this process so thank you. I appreciate having the witnesses together, and I want to make sure that--you know, so many of my fellow Kansans are being crushed with inflation the way it is going now, particularly with the economy and some of the regulatory burdens that have been imposed in the last few years, and we just can't afford to have this continued increase in prices. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Moore. Thank you to the gentleman from Kansas. I will now yield myself five minutes to jump in here as well. We will talk a little bit about competition and how we can address that to some degree, but, I mean, it is crucial to driving costs down and we know that. I am into this my second term. It was a debate question that I had in my very first debate that I ever had as a potential Member of Congress back in 2020, and it is frustrating to be here almost four years later still talking about the same thing, and I haven't solved it yet in my first two terms, but I have seen progress. I have seen a recognition that it needs to happen. Look, there are going to be times where you are in an ambulance and you are incapacitated and you are not going to choose which X-ray you are going to go to. Yeah, we know that. That is the point, that we can do better than what we are doing. But we recognize there is a difference in health care than there is in other industries, whether you are choosing which grocery store to shop at versus which emergency room to visit. Yes, we recognize that, but we can't give up on that the fact that it is a different industry, we just can't give up the fact that, you know, that there are better opportunities out there and we can't continue to do things the way that we have been doing them. The Federal Government spent roughly $1.5 trillion on our major health programs. That is more than defense and our entire, basically our entire discretionary budget, just on one specific issue. We know health care costs for the Federal Government and patients alike are on an unsustainable path in this country and they are a major driver of Federal spending comprising 17 percent of GDP in 2022. Solutions that can enhance transparency and promote competition will be critical to tackling this problem. Last year, House Republicans advanced bipartisan legislation, the Lower Costs, More Transparency Act, to combat consolidation and enhance free market competition. We have more work to do to improve the health system. Dr. White, I wanted a chance to hear from you. How does CBO approach estimating the budgetary effects of policies that aim to directly combat consolidation or inject competition into health care providers or payers? And does CBO credit any savings from this downward pressure on costs from increased competition? I know your job at CBO is very difficult and you have to take in more almost abstract consequent ideas. We talked earlier about medical innovation and there is so much benefit to that potential of incorporating. It is tough to incorporate into scoring. I get it. I would love to hear your thoughts on that, though. Dr. White. Sure. So let me give one example which is site- neutrality in Medicare. We have talked a lot about how that would tend to promote competition and take a thumb off the scale that is increasing consolidation, but there, the scoring would first start out with just figuring out how is that going to change Medicare prices and Medicare outlays? And then we would look at, is this a big enough deal to deflect the trajectory of consolidation? And is that going to affect the prices that private insurers pay? On other types of policies like funding for FTC or other pro-competitive measures, we would just look closely at, is this meaningful enough, big enough in the context of all the forces driving consolidation to deflect the trend to consolidation? And then if so, we would think about how that is going to affect the prices that private insurers pay. Mr. Moore. Excellent. That actually hits on the other question that I had so I will leave it be. It is just so much of what we do gets pinned down to the way the scoring plays out, and I know I share the actual Chairman of this Committee, it's not mine, I share his thoughts on needing to make any reforms we can to being big picture, thoughtful, futuristic on how we approach this issue. Because if we keep doing the same thing we have been doing we are just going to keep financing it in a different way, and we are not going to drive costs down. That is what we have to do, and we see it in other industries. Lastly, Dr. Ippolito, thank you for the last several weeks of your engagement with us and what AEI does to help provide a real thoughtful approach to issues all across the board, but particularly health care. We have heard a lot about in this Congress about vertical consolidation among payers, such as when a health plan acquires a pharmacy benefit manager or a pharmacy even. What impact do these mergers and acquisitions and this consolidation have on Federal spending and patient access to quality and affordable care, particularly in rural areas? Dr. Ippolito. You know, there are potential benefits from these kind of arrangements, but in terms of things you would be concerned about, the big question is do these entities start behaving in their own self-interest to the point that it is a negative for quality or access? Do they start preferencing their own providers they are integrated with? Do they preference drugs that they ship to your house through their specialty pharmacy? And while I don't know that we have great evidence on that, those are the areas that I would focus on. Mr. Moore. Excellent. Thank you very much, and I will cut myself off but I am going to hold on to the gavel so just remember that, Mr. Ferguson, when we get to you. Next up we will go--I will yield five minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Brecheen. Mr. Brecheen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Health care spending keeps going up in tandem with government involvement. We know that. So how do we have great care but at the same time allow people to keep the fruits of their labor? The framers of our Constitution understood that we have to have a free market. You have to have consumer choice. The best allocation of hard-earned dollars is a free market. Thomas Jefferson advised in 1787 that the Bill of Rights should include restrictions on private monopolies, interestingly enough. In 1788, James Madison called monopolies, ``The greatest nuisance in government.'' He went on further to say that, ``Monopolies are sacrificing the many to the few. Monopolies are an antithesis to the free market. The free market will always work absent monopolies,'' and this is destroying consumer choice. By the way, I would note that governments can become monopolies, too, when you take that all health care spending right now, the Federal Government is 35 percent of it, state and local is 15 percent of it. That is almost half of all spending is the government. It is a monopoly. And so, again, in tandem, what we see is the more government increases, so does the price. When the government tries to make things affordable it makes it expensive for everybody. Between 2002 to 2020 there were 1,000 mergers in hospitals in the United States, and on the concept of monopolies, each time these mergers occurred they led to an average increase in consumer cost of $521. In 2023, three pharmacy benefit managers, PBMs, processed 79 percent of all prescription drug claims. Each of these PBMs being owned by a health insurance agency. The average family health insurance premium of 2010--think government monopoly-- the year Obamacare became law was $13,000 according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. In 2024, the average family health insurance premium is now $23,000, almost a doubling of the cost according to CNN. In 2010, the average salary of a hospital CEO was $182,000. Now in 2024, that average CEO is getting $700,000, according to the Lown Institute. $35 trillion in debt, health care spending is the biggest contributor to our debt behind Social Security. What we spend on health care is 20 percent of our GDP. 20 percent of our entire gross domestic product is going to health care spending. What we spend on the government viewpoint is three times what we spend on defense. I want to add one more thing that is interesting because people think that in America our health care outcome is comparative to other nations. It is important to note, on the average outcomes comparable to the other advanced nations we are getting the same results, but we are spending $12,000 per person, and these other countries, these advanced countries, are spending $6,000. Something is happening. Again, I go back to the concept: the more government involvement we see, whether it is over time, the less competition, less choice of allocation of scarce resources. So let's discuss direct primary care because I think that is one of the most unique elements that is out there. It is where a physician can say for $50 to $100 a month, I will take care of your basic needs. It gets government, it gets insurance out of the mix, and so I would love to hear from you all quickly about direct primary care and your thoughts on that? Dr. White? Dr. White. First, this may come across as a little bit of a dodge, but--and I know HSA policy is related to direct primary care and can you pay for direct primary care out of HSA policy is also baked into the Internal Revenue Code, and so our colleagues at the Joint Committee on Taxation would lead analysis of that. That is just something I want to flag. We would work very closely with them in thinking about HSA policy if it were expanded to allow purchase of direct primary care. We would help them think about competitive effects, price effects, broader market effects, but they would take the lead. Mr. Brecheen. For the American Enterprise Institute, direct primary care? Your thoughts on how it is showcasing allocation of scarce resources in a competitive manner? Dr. Ippolito. Yeah. I mean, just speaking for myself personally, you know, there is a conceptual appeal to this which is that if we can move in the direction of having health insurance focus on the expensive, unexpected stuff and less on the relatively predictable, low-cost things, then we get a more efficient health insurance system. So generally speaking, to the extent that direct primary care is trying to work in that direction, I think it has some appeal. Mr. Brecheen. So, well, at least for time considerations, so also what we see is post-Affordable Care Act, again, whatever you try to make affordable you make more expensive. We know that, 46 percent increase in cost just since Obamacare. More government, more cost. What we are losing is catastrophic loss coverage and me caring about the price of things. When I go through a health care expenditure, what I am worried about, when I am going to pay for something, I care about quality plus price. But when insurance paid for it I just care about quality. So I am only concerned about my copay or my deductible. How do we get catastrophic loss-type policies back into the markets in tandem with deductibles that would be, you know, a part of that and me self-insuring in part, so that everybody has skin in the game over price. I will go back to you, the American Enterprise Institute. I am over time. Dr. Ippolito. Yeah. I am over time so I will be very brief, but just say that I think there is a lot of conceptual appeal to this idea of getting a more efficient health insurance plan that focuses specifically on the expensive stuff that is hard for you personally to insure against and focusing less on using all this bureaucratic cost to pay relatively routine low-cost bills. Mr. Brecheen. And with that, Mr. Chairman, thank you for your indulgence. I yield. Mr. Moore. The gentleman yields. I now recognize for five minutes the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Ferguson. Mr. Ferguson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before I get into my questions I would ask unanimous consent to submit to the record letters and statements from the following organizations, including Better Solutions for Health Care, American Pharmacists Association, Coalition Against Socialized Medicine, Dr. Rick Snyder, President of Heart Place, and Patients Rising. Mr. Moore. Without objection.   Mr. Ferguson. Thank you, sir. All right. So I look at where we are with health care right now and I ask myself three questions, okay? And I am doing this as a consumer. I am doing it as a former provider. Here are the questions. Number one, is health care more expensive today than it was 15 years ago? Number two, are Americans healthier today than they were 15 years ago? And number three, is there better utilization of the system than there was 15 years ago? So real quickly, going down the line here, relative to inflation or any metrics that you want to use, does health care cost significantly more than it did 15 years ago? Dr. White. More expensive, yes. Mr. Ferguson. Yes? Okay. Dr. Ippolito. It is more expensive. Mr. Ferguson. All right. Dr. Bruggeman. Yes. Mr. Ferguson. Are Americans healthier today than they were 15 years ago? Dr. White. No. Ms. Tripoli. It depends on the metric you are looking at. Mr. Ferguson. Okay. Dr. White. Life expectancy has flattened out. It stopped improving. Mr. Ferguson. All right. My dear friend and Ranking Member from Pennsylvania made the comment in his opening remarks that more people have insurance than have ever had. Access is one thing. Utilization is another. Is the utilization of the population from the middle class downward, is that utilization, has it increased significantly in the system over the last, over the last decade and a half? We don't have an answer to that. It's fine. We don't know. I am going to go back and I am going to put my provider hat on, okay? I was blessed enough in my dental practice to be able to take care of folks across the economic spectrum, folks that were, you know, looking for meals the next day that may have been on Medicaid up to folks that had unlimited means. And those two groups of people got the exact same level of care in my practice. We did not distinguish based off of income. They got the same level of care. The biggest challenge that we had, quite candidly back then, was the utilization of that system and understanding that folks that were in poverty had a crisis every day and sometimes preventive care was not at the forefront of their minds, understandably so, a lot of challenges in life there. But when I look at the system that is in place now, we cannot answer three basic questions. Does it cost less, are we healthier, and is the utilization of the system by those that primarily need it, is it better? And the answer to all of those is no. So we have heard a lot of conversation about PBMs, about insurance companies, about site-neutral payments; there is a whole litany of things that this Committee has talked about. All of those players in there, we have a tendency in one way or the other, to vilify. Aren't they just operating under the rules that this place created? So if we believe that there is too much private equity, if we believe that there is a lack of transparency, if we believe that utilization is not where it should be, if we are less healthy, if we are not, you know, if we are paying entirely too much for our health care right now, and we look at the players that are in the system, insurance company, PBM, pharmacy, hospital provider, and they are vertically integrated and they are allowed to do that and encouraged to do that because of the very rules that are in place, maybe shouldn't we be looking at breaking those rules apart and creating real transparency and competition within the system? I will ask that question. Should we be looking at breaking down the vertical integration to end the incestuous relationships between these entities so that you create real competition at the various levels? Dr. Bruggeman. I mean, I think the answer is absolutely yes. Mr. Ferguson. Okay. I look at what we did with the telecom industry. I say we, I wasn't here that long ago, thank goodness, but when we took Ma Bell and broke it apart and we created the seven Baby Bells and we opened up competition, we had the greatest technological innovation that you have ever seen. That is why we have broadband. It is why we have call conferencing and now Zoom. You are walking around with, you know, something that can run, you know, a spaceship in your pocket. I mean, these things are incredibly powerful and yet their cost relative to everything else has come down, right? Shouldn't we be looking at health care the same way? Shouldn't we be looking at how do you take that system, break it apart into different pieces that literally create real competition, innovation, shareholder value, and, most importantly, better quality of care for the patient? And part of that would be the elimination of the massive administrative costs that exist in our current health care system. Make sense? Doctor? Dr. Bruggeman. I say absolutely. Mr. Ferguson. Okay. Mr. Chairman, with that I yield back. Mr. Moore. Thank you. The gentlemen yields, and we now yield to the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Good, for the remaining five minutes. Mr. Good. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to our witnesses. You can see the sunlight or the daylight at the end of the tunnel here. In 2031, or roughly seven years from now, it is predicted that health care spending will reach $7 trillion on an annual basis, or about 20 percent of GDP. Our national debt is at $35 trillion, a little over $100,000 per American citizen. We are on the Budget Committee here. The President wants to take it to $50 trillion in the next ten years if his budget were to be enacted, and that is without any additional emergency supplemental spending. We know the long-term trajectory for health care spending is not good and that has a tremendous impact on the budget. We really ought to be as a Congress doing hearings on how nutrition spending and subsidies in the ag and farm bill and so forth is actually funding and subsidizing the wrong kind of food for Americans. So many are profiting off sick Americans and how many compromised individuals are making decisions for how our whole system works? And the explosion of obesity, diabetes, chronic diet-caused illnesses, drug treatment proliferation, and actually, I am seeing reports that young people are for the first time, children, especially if you get diabetes at a young age or you are projected to live--a child who gets diabetes at an early age is projected to die before their parents. And just this explosion of this self-caused--we have 50 percent obesity in our country and you have got three percent in Japan. Why is that? Because of diet. So anyway, health care is a huge cost here to our budget problems, of course, health care costs, but we are exacerbating it with our diet and with our whole system, our whole subsidies particularly in our nutrition system in that farm and ag bill. That said, Dr. White, transparency in health care pricing, consolidation in health care markets has accelerated in recent years. There is less competition, yet there is increased Federal spending and yet costs continue. That is the one constant as Mr. Ferguson said a moment ago, that costs continue to rise. CBO states that increased transparency in health care reduces costs because it gives patients and plan sponsors more info to make informed decisions. By negotiating with drug manufacturers and pharmacists to control costs, PBMs have a significant behind-the-scenes impact in determining total costs for insurers, shaping patients' access to medication and to determine how much pharmacies are paid. Where are you at with believing that, you know, does increased transparency actually--some have said that increased transparency will raise costs because the PBMs can collude and some claim that the transparency inhibits the payers' ability to negotiate prices. Where are you at with, in terms of transparency and price? Where are you at and what is the impact that is going to have? Dr. White. You know, in general we think about who needs information to buy the services they are buying? How are they getting that information? Are they able to act on it? And in the PBM space employers are choosing health plans, including PBMs, and if they have better information on PBMs and what different PBMs charge they are going to be able to shop better for PBM services. So more transparency for employers, especially small employers, is going to drive down the fees that PBMs are able to retain. Similar with state Medicaid agencies, if they have better visibility into what different PBMs are charging they can shop better for PBM services. That lowers Medicaid costs. That lowers the Federal deficit. Mr. Good. Switching to 340B for a moment in the limited time that I have, that is an important program for my district being a predominantly rural district. How has the 340B program contributed to consolidation in the hospital markets and the proliferation of contract pharmacies that are owned by these large health insurance companies? Dr. White. That is a great question. We are digging pretty deeply into the 340B program right now, and at a high level if you were an oncology practice and you are facing the choice of joining a large system and becoming a 340B-covered entity or remaining independent, if you join the 340B system you can buy your drugs at a heavily discounted 340B price, sell them to Part D patients, private patients, at a much higher price. That is a financial windfall that can be shared between the oncology practice and the larger system. To my read of the evidence it is clearly a contributor to consolidation. Mr. Good. So what would you do about that? Dr. White. We don't recommend policy, but my sense is that there is a lot of interest just in more visibility into how the 340B program works, what facilities are doing with the revenues they get. That seems to be where the discussion is mostly at these days. Mr. Good. All right. I thank you, sir, and I yield, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Moore. Thank you. The gentleman yields. Thank you all, Dr. White, Dr. Ippolito, and Dr. Bruggeman, and Ms. Tripoli. Thank you for appearing before us today. Please be advised that Members may submit written questions to be answered later in writing. Those questions and your answers will be made part of the formal hearing record. Any Members who wish to submit questions for the record may do so within seven days. With that, the Committee stands adjourned.
