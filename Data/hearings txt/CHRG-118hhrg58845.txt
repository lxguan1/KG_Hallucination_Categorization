STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVES ON OSHA'S PROPOSED RULE TO UPDATE THE FIRE BRIGADES STANDARD ---------- Tuesday, June 4, 2024 U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security, Subcommittee on Emergency Management and Technology, Washington, DC. The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:04 a.m., in room 310, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. Anthony D'Esposito (Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding. Present: Representatives D'Esposito, LaLota, Strong, Brecheen, Carter, and Kennedy. Also present: Representatives Lawler and Molinaro. Mr. D'Esposito. The Committee on Homeland Security, Subcommittee on Emergency Management and Technology, will come to order. The purpose of this hearing is to hear from fire service associations on the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration's proposed rulemaking to update and replace the current Fire Brigades Standard. Without objection, the gentlemen from New York, Mr. Molinaro and Mr. Lawler, are permitted to sit on the dais and ask questions to the witnesses. I now recognize myself for an opening statement. First, I'd like to welcome our witnesses and thank you all for your commitment to keeping, not only our neighbors and residents, but this country safe. I want to thank you all for testifying before this Subcommittee on Emergency Management and Technology, and, again, thank you for your public service. We look forward to hearing your diverse perspectives on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's proposed rule to upgrade the Fire Brigades Standard and its potential impact on firefighters throughout the Nation. As the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Management and Technology, and also as a former chief of the Island Park Fire Department, I know first-hand that the fire brigades selflessly put the safety of their communities first, despite experiencing a multitude of risks while serving on the job. It is important that we mitigate unnecessary risks posed to our Nation's firefighters. We must find a balanced approach that promotes firefighter safety and prevents regulatory burdens that ultimately make communities less safe. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 gave OSHA the authority to create, modify, or revoke work standards for private-sector employers, the U.S. Postal Service, and the Federal Government. While State and local fire departments are excluded from OSHA enforcement if their State does not have an OSHA-approved plan in place, there are 27 States whose State and local fire departments are bound by OSHA's standard for fire brigades. The fire brigade standard was created in 1980 to require firefighting training, education, and protective gear for fire departments. However, there have been no significant updates to the rule since it was originally created in 1980. The terrorist attacks of 9/11 highlighted the need for improved coordination and emergency preparedness and response for an updated safety standard for fire brigades. Today we have a better understanding of the risks firefighters have experienced over the years, and it's common sense to consider updating the standard. Earlier this year, the subcommittee held a hearing to examine lithium-ion batteries and the unique challenges posed to fire departments. It makes sense that as threats evolve, safety standards should be updated to protect our Nation's first responders. That's why in 2007, OSHA requested information from emergency responders on actions OSHA should take to improve emergency response and preparedness across this great Nation. Since then, OSHA has continued to take efforts to update the safety regulations for fire brigades, and this February, OSHA proposed a new rule for an Emergency Response Standard. The proposed standard is wider scope and would apply not just to firefighting but also emergency medical services and technical search and rescue. Among the requirements, OSHA's proposed rule would require new written emergency response plans, hazard-vulnerability assessments, training, personal equipment, medical screenings, and behavioral health services for our Nation's fire brigades. It also includes provisions to improve cardiovascular health and cancer prevention. Considering that OSHA started the process over a decade ago to develop the proposed standard, I was pleased to see that the proposed rule's comment period deadline was extended to June 21, but I hope that OSHA will consider extending the comment period even further so that others have additional time to review the 600-page proposal and ensure that their vital input is heard. As we review the impacts of OSHA and its proposed standard, it is important that Federal regulators consider the impact that a proposed rule could have on smaller fire departments throughout the Nation. It is unclear how the proposed standard would impact volunteer-run fire departments in States with an OSHA-approved plan. Would volunteer firefighters be held to the same standard as employed firefighters? How will this proposed rule affect recruitment and retention? What are the costs associated with adopting these new standards? Are additional training or fitness requirements achievable, or have they become burdensome? I appreciate OSHA's efforts to improve firefighters' operation environments, but there are concerns that volunteer fire departments in smaller municipalities may not have the resources to implement the proposed changes in their current state. It is estimated that over 1 million emergency responders fall within the scope of the proposed rule, with over 331,000 of whom are volunteers. Therefore, as I stated in a recent letter to OSHA's assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health, I encourage OSHA to consider the unique needs of volunteer fire departments and to incorporate their feedback into the proposed standard before the comment period ends. Each community has different needs and capabilities, and I am confident that we can find a balanced approach that prioritizes safety without hurting these smaller volunteers throughout the country. I am committed to supporting our Nation's firefighters, both career and volunteer, and ensuring that they have every resource necessary to provide the best emergency response services to their community. I look forward to having a robust conversation to consider the potential positive and some negative impacts that this rule may have. Thank you again to our witnesses for participating in this hearing today.  Statement of Chairman Anthony D'Esposito June 4, 2024 Welcome to our witnesses. Thank you all for testifying before the Subcommittee on Emergency Management and Technology. Thank you for your public service and for providing emergency response services in your respective communities.

Mr. D'Esposito. I now recognize the Ranking Member of the Emergency Management and Technology Subcommittee, the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Carter, for his opening statement. Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for being here. I want to thank our witnesses for being here today to discuss the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's proposed rule to update Fire Brigade Standards. When I was a young member of the New Orleans City Council many years ago, I was successful in creating our first responders and firefighters, creating the reality that in most cases, not all, firefighters are closest, easiest, and prepared to be able to at least be the first on the scene to assess the situation before EMTs arrive. Somewhere in there, we admittedly neglected a bigger piece of that puzzle, is making sure that we duly compensated you for that extra work and also provided additional resources. So here we are today to hear from you and to make sure that we are recognizing the incredible work that you do and the countless amount of lives that you have saved and will continue to save as first responders, getting on the scene and providing much-needed assessment and medical attention to a person in need. So let me tell you how much I appreciate you and how much I fully support first responders and appreciate the witnesses being here today before our subcommittee. My understanding is that OSHA's proposed rule on Fire Brigade Standards is not necessarily a new idea. It has origins in some of Government's evaluations after September 11, 2001. I understand that the comment period for the proposed rule issued by OSHA in February and the deadline for submitting comments has been extended. I encourage all stakeholders to provide feedback to OSHA on this proposed rule so that the Biden administration, in its efforts to enhance the work environment for first responders, is well-informed with the diverse perspectives that only you can bring. I'm eager to hear from our witnesses on how to strengthen this new proposed rule. Your insights should be valuable in ensuring that the standard effectively enhances the safety and health of all emergency responders. Along the same lines of looking at issues that impact first responders, I feel it important to acknowledge that hurricane season started on Saturday. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warned that the United States could face one of the worst hurricane seasons in the last 2 decades. I represent New Orleans, a place that is no stranger to disasters. The city has been at the forefront of disasters, from Hurricane Katrina to Ida, and so many more. The aftermath of these hurricanes was nothing short of devastating, and climate change will only lead to more frequent and intense natural disasters. More recently across the United States, we've had an increase in tornado activity, with tornadoes touching down in all but 2 days between April 25 and May 27, which is 94 percent of the days past. In fact, last month was the most active month for severe weather since 2011. Over the Memorial Day weekend deadly tornadoes killed at least 24 people, including children. I take this subcommittee's oversight duties very seriously, as does our Chairman. As we continue to see evidence of climate change, it is important that this subcommittee focus on the Nation's preparedness for disaster, and I encourage the Chairman and my colleagues to work alongside both sides of the aisle to recognize that storms don't recognize, nor appreciate, any differences in people, party, or locale, that this, if nothing else, is a bipartisan effort that we should always swing together to hit to the benches, to make sure that we are preparing for storms and giving you, our first responders, every protection, tool, and resource that you need in order to continue doing the great job that you do. Mr. Chairman, I yield.  Statement of Ranking Member Troy A. Carter June 4, 2024 I want to thank our witnesses for being here today to discuss the Occupational Safety Health Administration's (OSHA) proposed rule to update the Fire Brigades Standard. I want to say from the outset that I fully support first responders and I appreciate the first responder witnesses before our subcommittee today. My understanding is that OSHA's proposed rule on the fire brigades standard is not necessarily a new idea and has its origins in some of the Government's evaluations after September 11, 2001. I understand that the comment period for the proposed rule was issued by OSHA in February and the deadline for submitting comments has been extended. I encourage all stakeholders to provide feedback to OSHA on this proposed rule so that the Biden administration, in its efforts to enhance the work environment for first responders, is well-informed with diverse perspectives. I am eager to hear from our witnesses on how to strengthen this new proposed rule. Your insights will be valuable in ensuring that the standard effectively enhances the safety and health of all emergency responders. Along the same lines of looking at issues that impact first responders, I feel it important to acknowledge that hurricane season started on Saturday. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) warned that the United States could face one of its worst hurricane seasons in 2 decades. I represent New Orleans, a place that is no stranger to disasters. The city has been at the forefront of disasters from Hurricane Katrina to Hurricane Ida. The aftermath of these hurricanes was nothing short of devastating, and climate change will only lead to more frequent and intense natural disasters. More recently, across the United States, we have had an increase in tornado activity with ``tornadoes touching down on all but 2 days between April 25 and May 27, which is 94 percent of days.'' In fact, last month was the most active month for severe weather since 2011. Over the Memorial Day weekend, deadly tornadoes killed at least 24 people, including children. I take this subcommittee's oversight duties very seriously. As we continue to see evidence of climate change, it is important for this subcommittee to focus on our Nation's preparedness for disasters and I would encourage the Chairman and colleagues on the other side of the aisle to make addressing climate change a priority. I, also, think it is important for the subcommittee to confront cuts to FEMA's preparedness grants that were pushed by House Republican leadership. The 10 percent cut to the grant programs, including the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, is a significant hit to our first responders. Congress can and should do better to support those who help our communities and I hope this subcommittee will do more oversight of these grants. Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you, Mr. Ranking Member. Other Members of the subcommittee are reminded that opening statements may be submitted for the record.  Statement of Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson June 4, 2024 Good morning. I want to thank our witnesses for appearing before the subcommittee to discuss the Occupational Safety Health Administration's (OSHA) new proposed rule to update the Fire Brigades Standard. For 26 years, I served as a volunteer firefighter in my community. I know the sacrifices of firefighters, and I applaud our fire service witnesses here today for your continued service to your communities. Thank you for the sacrifices you and your family make to help those in need. Given the threats our firefighters face in their daily work, robust safety standards are important. The challenges and risks firefighters face, especially in volunteer and rural settings, can be immense. I commend the Biden administration for seeking to help first responders. The new proposed OSHA rule to update the Fire Brigades Standard is designed to benefit firefighters by including provisions for mental health support and addressing other often-overlooked health concerns. This holistic approach ensures that our firefighters receive comprehensive care, promoting their physical and psychological well- being. The Biden administration is doing the right thing by extending the comment period for proposed rule to ensure that stakeholders have ample opportunity to provide input. The American first responder community is strong, and it deserves the utmost support from Congress. However, under the House Republican leadership, a 10 percent cut was implemented to the full suite of FEMA grants for fiscal year 2024 appropriations, which included cuts to the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFG), the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER), the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSP), and the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) for fiscal year 2024. While cuts to the grants have been proposed by both Republican and Democratic administrations, for nearly a decade Congress has resisted cuts to these critically important grant programs. The fiscal year 2024 cuts were a departure from recent precedent and, more importantly, undermine essential support for firefighters, compromising their ability to respond effectively to emergencies and exposing them and communities to greater risk. Reduced funding means fewer resources for critical training, equipment, and staffing, which are vital for ensuring safety and preparedness during emergencies. Last, I want to note that hurricane season started just days ago, and it is predicted to be record-breaking. I would like to encourage this subcommittee to do more oversight of Federal Emergency Management Agency's preparation for hurricane season. I yield back. Mr. D'Esposito. I am pleased to have a distinguished panel of witnesses before us today on this very important topic. I ask that our witnesses please rise and raise their right hand.  Mr. D'Esposito. Let the record reflect that the witnesses have answered in the affirmative. Thank you. You may be seated. I would now like to formally introduce our witnesses. Mr. David Denniston serves as the second vice president of the Association of Fire Districts of the State of New York. He has 30-plus years in the fire service and is the past chief of the Cortlandville Fire Department. Mr. Joe Maruca is the director of the National Volunteer Fire Council from Massachusetts and was the chief of the West Barnstable Fire Department on Cape Cod for 18 years. Mr. Maruca served as a volunteer firefighter from 1977 until becoming chief in 2005. Mr. Evan Davis currently serves as the director of government affairs for the International Association of Fire Fighters where he manages the organization's legislative and regulatory initiatives to promote firefighter safety and community emergency preparedness. Mr. Grant Walker serves as president of the Prince George's County Professional Fire Fighters and Paramedics Association and previously served as a district representative for Howard, Montgomery, Prince George's, Charles, Calvert, and St. Mary's Counties in the Professional Firefighters of Maryland. I thank all the witnesses for being here today, and, most importantly, I thank you for your years of dedicated service. I now recognize Mr. Denniston for 5 minutes to summarize his opening statement. STATEMENT OF DAVID DENNISTON, SECOND VICE PRESIDENT, ASSOCIATION OF FIRE DISTRICTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK Mr. Denniston. Good morning, Chairman D'Esposito, distinguished Members of Congress, honored guests. My name is David Denniston. I'm the vice president of the Association of Fire Districts, State of New York. I also serve as the fire commissioner of the Virgil Fire District. Virgil is a small rural community in upstate New York, just south of Syracuse. There are approximately 2,500 residents with an annual household income of $78,000 and an average home value of $162,000. The Virgil Fire Department is a 100 percent volunteer department with 35 active members and an annual budget of $280,000. That's a total budget of $280,000. We are not the largest department in New York State, but we're certainly not the smallest either. We represent an average-sized department in the upstate New York region. Many of you on this committee either live or represent small rural towns just like mine. I would ask you to consider the impact this proposed rule would have on the community you have been elected to represent. What would happen in your community if a citizen dialed 9-1-1, and there was no emergency services agency to respond because they're unable to meet a Federal standard? As a fire commissioner, I've been reviewing the proposed Emergency Response Rule and exploring the impact it would have on my fire district. I'm working with authorities having jurisdiction across New York State with the Association of Fire Districts. I would be remiss if I did not share I'm not alone in my feelings that this proposed rule, as currently written, would have devastating effects on our ability to operate and provide fire protection to our communities. The hardest-hit will be the small rural all-volunteer departments. While we wholeheartedly agree that changes and enhancements are needed to the 40-year-old-plus standard, this proposed rule is neither economically or technically feasible for our fire district. There are two fundamental requirements by OSHA rule. The agency has fallen far short in these areas. The proposed rule is both arbitrary and capricious as both the process and logic used to support these new requirements are severely flawed. OSHA neither followed the required full negotiated rule- making process, nor did it include adequate representation of the volunteer fire service, which covers about 65 percent of this country. Just last week I met with over 40 fire chiefs from the State of Indiana. Only 8 of the 40 fire chiefs even knew the proposed change existed. OSHA has failed to follow the Department of Labor Information Quality Guidelines, and several of the data sources cited in the proposed rule change are not representative of the documents. For example, OSHA references the Firehouse Magazine Annual Run Survey. This document is not statistically significant in any fashion, and yet has been used as a main source of data that will make it nearly impossible for small and rural fire departments to function. Based on this report, OSHA believes the average volunteer or combination fire department budget in the United States is $1.7 million. We do not have a single all-volunteer department in my county that has an annual budget of even a million dollars, let alone an average of $1.7 million. We compliment OSHA on trying to make first responders safer. I, myself, have dedicated my life to this effort and currently present fire leadership and safety training courses across the United States. While I wholeheartedly agree that changes are needed, this proposal, as written, is not the answer. I believe that OSHA had the best intentions in this process. However, it's fallen short in producing an accurate picture of the fire service here in the United States. OSHA has failed to show the data or significant risk that supports many of the changes proposed. Both the fire service injuries and deaths are on a decline over the last several years, while at the same time the thresholds to be considered a line-of-duty death have been lowered. The largest hurdle in all of this is the incorporated 22 NFPA standards to the rule. This takes a somewhat manageable rule from over 40 pages to over 3,000. The 1,500 ``shalls'' and ``musts'' make it overwhelming at best. Based on their incorporation, OSHA appears to be under the impression that current NFPA standards are being followed by agencies across the country. This simply is not the case. I work with thousands of departments across the United States and have yet to find one that comes close to meeting these in their entirety. In our opinion, OSHA has failed to follow the procedures and rules it is governed by. One could argue that the door has been left wide open for legal challenges should this proposed rule be adopted as written. This is neither our desire, nor our intent. We are simply asking that the process be reopened, more transparent, better communicated, and the rule be rewritten using reliable data with the assistance of equal representation by those that it will affect. By working together, we can craft a rule that will not only be obtainable, but will also do a better job in protecting those that risk their lives to save the lives of their communities. Thank you for allowing me to share a few concerns in this brief statement. We're not asking for this effort to go away or kicking a can down the road. We are simply asking for an appropriate seat at the table as we proceed to make firefighting safer for all of us in this country.  Prepared Statement of David Denniston Distinguished Members of Congress and honored guests, my name is David Denniston, and I am vice president of the Association of Fire Districts of the State of New York. I also serve as a fire commissioner of the Virgil Fire District. Virgil is a small, rural community in upstate NY, just south of Syracuse.

For example, OSHA references the Firehouse Magazine Annual Run Survey.

Based on this report, OSHA believes the average fire department budget in the United States is $1.7 million.

We compliment OSHA on trying to make first responders safer. I have dedicated my life to this effort, and currently present fire leadership and safety training courses across the United States in firehouses, conferences, and virtually. I have personally taught over 35,000 students on these subjects. While we have a lot more work to do, this proposed rule is not the answer. I believe that OSHA had the best of intensions in this process, it has fallen short of producing an accurate picture of the fire service in the United States. OSHA has also failed to show data or a significant risk that supports many of the changes proposed. Both fire service injuries and deaths are on a decline over the past several years, while at the same time the thresholds to be considered a line-of-duty injury or death have been lowered. The largest hurdle of all is the incorporation of 22 different NFPA standards into the rule. This takes a somewhat manageable rule from 40 pages to over 3,000. The 1,500 plus ``Shalls'' and ``Musts'' make it overwhelming at best. Based on their incorporation, OSHA appears to be under the impression that the current NFPA standards are for being followed by agencies across the country. This is not the case. I work with thousands of departments across the United States and have yet to find one that comes close to meeting these standards entirely. In our opinion, OSHA has failed to follow many of the procedures and rules it is governed by. One could argue that the door has been left wide open for legal challenges should this proposed rule be adopted as presented. This is neither our desire nor intent. We are simply asking that the process be reopened, more transparent, better communicated, and the rule be rewritten using reliable data with the assistance of equal representation by those that it will affect. By working together, we can craft a new rule that will not only be attainable but will also do a better job protecting those that risk their own lives to benefit their communities. I would offer the following proposals: (1) If OSHA is truly interested in having input and working with the fire service, we need to extend the comment period deadline until at least 9/21/24. As I already stated, as have several others in their public comments, the fire service in general is just becoming aware of this process and proposed rule. It has not been communicated well to the department level. The 608- page document takes time to read and digest. I personally have hundreds of hours invested at this point and I still am trying to absorb all the details. It took OSHA several years to write this proposal, and yet they want to give only 90 days for others to communicate and understand it. The two short extensions now by OSHA are appreciated, but we simply need more time. (2) Remove the incorporated by reference NFPA standards and replace them with the desired and relevant wording in the rule itself. Doing so will produce an understandable, clear document that does not require hours of research, digesting, and trying to sort out where the actual rule conflicts with the incorporated standard as it has currently done. (3) Consider tailoring specific requirements within the standard to 4 segments of the fire service. This proposed rule places industry fire brigades, career departments, volunteer departments, and EMS agencies all in the same box. We are 4 very different disciplines that are funded differently, respond differently, exposed to hazards at different levels, and have different resources to respond. This ``one-size-fits-all'' approach is extremely problematic, and in many cases tries to place a square peg in a round hole. (4) Give the Volunteer Fire Service a seat at the table equivalent to the 65 percent of the country that it represents. (5) Use relevant data. Much of the data cited by OSHA in the document is outdated, not statistically relevant, or not used in the manner for which it was intended lending to false assumptions. Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you, Mr. Denniston. I now recognize Chief Maruca for 5 minutes to summarize his opening statement. STATEMENT OF JOSEPH MARUCA, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL VOLUNTEER FIRE COUNCIL, FORMER FIRE CHIEF OF WEST BARNSTABLE FIRE DEPARTMENT Mr. Maruca. Good morning, Chairman D'Esposito, Ranking Member Carter, distinguished Members of Congress. My name is Joe Maruca. I am a firefighter with over 45 years of experience, and I am the director of the National Volunteer Fire Council. I recently retired as chief of the West Barnstable, Massachusetts, Fire Department, a combination fire department with 5 career firefighter/paramedics and 45 volunteer firefighters on Cape Cod. The NVFC is the leading nonprofit membership association, representing the interests of the volunteer fire, EMS, and rescue services. We serve as the national voice for over 670,000 volunteer firefighters who comprise 65 percent of the Nation's fire service. The NVFC appreciates OSHA's efforts to promote our mutual goal of ensuring firefighter safety with this proposed Emergency Response Standard. However, if adopted as written, the standard would be economically infeasible for most volunteer fire departments to comply with and would cause many of these departments to shut down, therefore, compromising the emergency response capabilities in many small towns, particularly those in rural areas. In addition to its economic infeasibility, this proposed standard would be problematic due to the incorporation by reference of industry standards, uncertainty about volunteer coverage, lack of staff expertise and availability to facilitate the implementation of these standards, and an unrealistic proposed time line for implementation. For these reasons, the NVFC believes OSHA should exempt volunteer firefighters from the proposed standard. The NVFC is concerned that OSHA is unaware of the varied ways that volunteer fire departments are organized, and therefore unaware of the extent that their proposed Emergency Response Standard would impact the volunteer fire service, especially when it comes to how volunteer fire departments in many areas of the country are organized as nonprofit and are unaffiliated with any municipality, and these could fall within the scope of the proposed standards regardless of what State they're in. Due to the diverse nature of the volunteer fire service, the NVFC believes it should not fall within the scope of OSHA's proposed Emergency Response Standard. When it comes to evaluating the economic feasibility of OSHA's proposed standard, it's important to realize that 95 percent of volunteer firefighters serve populations of less than 25,000 people, and about half of volunteers serve in communities of fewer than 2,500 people. National needs assessments of the Nation's fire service consistently show that volunteer fire departments in small and rural communities have the most difficulty affording up-to-date equipment and operations. In an NVFC department budget survey with 1,766 responses, 28 percent said their Department's budget is less than $75,000 per year. This happens to be the typical budget for an on-call volunteer fire department in a Massachusetts town of 2,500 or smaller people. Departments with this budget struggle to pay for fuel, supplies, and gear, with the average cost of equipping a single firefighter with a bunker coat, bunker pants, and boots and a helmet being $4,600. OSHA estimates the average cost of their proposed standard to be about $14,000 per volunteer fire department. When you have a $75,000 budget, that's a huge bite. It's economically infeasible to have small departments adhere to the same standard as a large suburban or urban community would. The main source of Federal support to supplement these local fire departments is the Assistance to Firefighters Grant and Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response. Though AFG and SAFER have been successful, there is not enough funding available to address the needs of the fire service, especially if we have an economic burden added by OSHA. Since 2017, funding for AFG and SAFER has fallen by $81 million each. Last year, only 13 percent of funding requests were funded by AFG and SAFER. The NVFC urges Congress to pass the reauthorization of AFG and SAFER before their September 30 sunset and increase funding for these critically important grant programs. Contributing to the economic infeasibility are numbers of prohibitive requirements that are contained within the Emergency Response Standard, including the incorporation by reference of 20 standards. I'm out of time, so I'm just going to say thank you very much. We thank the subcommittee for holding this important hearing and for the opportunity to testify about the needs of the volunteer fire service. We thank Chair--or should I say Chief--D'Esposito for his years of service as a volunteer firefighter, and other Members as well, for their leadership on this issue. Thank you.  Prepared Statement of Joseph Maruca June 4, 2024 Good morning, Chair D'Esposito, Ranking Member Carter, and distinguished Members of the subcommittee. My name is Joseph Maruca and I am a firefighter with 45 years of experience. In April, I retired as chief of the West Barnstable Fire Department on Cape Cod, Massachusetts and I served as a volunteer firefighter from 1977 until becoming chief in 2005. West Barnstable is a combination fire department with 5 career firefighters/paramedics and 45 volunteer firefighters. Additionally, I represent Massachusetts as a director of the National Volunteer Fire Council (NVFC) and I have represented the NVFC as chair of the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) 1917 Technical Committee, which is the Standard for Automotive Ambulances. During my time as a volunteer firefighter, my other career was practicing as an attorney concentrating on estate planning. On behalf of the NVFC, I'd like to thank the subcommittee for holding this important hearing and allowing me to have the opportunity to speak about the Occupational Health and Safety Administration's (OSHA) proposed Emergency Response Standard. The NVFC serves as the national voice for over 670,000 volunteer firefighters comprising 65 percent of the Nation's fire service. The NVFC formulates this national voice via our Board of Directors, which are appointed by State firefighter associations from 47 States. Since 1976, the NVFC has been the leading nonprofit membership association representing the interests of the volunteer fire, EMS, and rescue services. The NVFC provides critical resources, programs, education, and advocacy to support the interests of volunteer first responders across the Nation. position on osha's proposed emergency response standard On February 5, 2024 the OSHA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register for a proposed new ``Emergency Response Standard'' . This proposed would replace the agency's ``Fire Brigades Standard'' (29 CFR 1910.156). The public comment period for OSHA's proposed Emergency Response standard is currently scheduled to conclude on July 22, 2024. The publication of this proposed standard is the latest step in a rulemaking process dating back to 2007, which has involved a request for information in 2007, a National Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety and Health (NACOSH) Emergency Responder Preparedness Subcommittee in 2015, and a Small Business Advocacy Review (SBAR) panel in 2021. The NVFC was represented on the NACOSH and SBAR panels. The NVFC appreciates OSHA's efforts to promote our mutual goal of ensuring firefighter safety by putting forth this proposed Emergency Response Standard. We believe the proposed standard contains many provisions that would serve the fire service well and protect the well- being of firefighters. However, if adopted as written, this proposed standard would be economically infeasible for volunteer fire departments to comply with and could cause many of these departments to shut down. This proposed standard could also compromise the safety and emergency response capabilities of many small communities, particularly small communities in rural areas. In addition to its economic infeasibility, this proposed standard would be problematic due to a number of other factors including: the incorporation by reference of industry consensus standards, numerous ambiguities on how volunteers would be covered, the lack of personnel expertise and availability to facilitate implementation, and an unrealistic proposed time line for implementation. For these reasons, the NVFC would like OSHA to exempt volunteer firefighters from this proposed standard. scope of the proposed standard The new Emergency Response Standard would be broader than OSHA's current Fire Brigade Standard. The NPRM for the proposed Emergency Response Standard is very unclear on which volunteer fire departments and personnel would be covered by the standard. The NPRM contains a section that lists the SBAR panel's recommendations and OSHA's responses. Some of these recommendations include OSHA's need to clearly explain who falls within the scope of the standard and determine which States consider volunteer firefighters as employees who would be covered by the standard. OSHA responds to these recommendations, explaining that both the text of the proposed standard and the NPRM address which volunteers would be covered by the proposed standard. However, there are many variables like compensations level, department structure/funding sources, and location that may impact how volunteers fall within the scope of this proposed standard that OSHA still doesn't adequately explain. Paragraph A of the proposed Emergency Response Standard is supposed to address scope. Paragraph A does explain how emergency response organizations and the personnel of these organizations would fall within the scope of the standard but doesn't delve further into specifics and leaves many unanswered questions regarding these variables mentioned above. The NPRM attempts to shed light on some of these specifics. Regarding compensation, it explains that while the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act does not apply to volunteers, some workers labeled as volunteers may actually be considered employees under Federal law because they receive a certain level of compensation, which may include the direct payment of money or other types of remuneration. Therefore, any emergency responders who are referred to as volunteers but receive ``significant remuneration'' within the meaning of Federal law would be included within the scope of this proposed standard as employees. However, the NPRM does not define significant remuneration. The NPRM goes on to explain that the OSH Act does not include the United States (not including the United States Postal Service) or any State or political subdivision of a State. However, there are 29 States with OSHA-approved State Plans and there is variability as to whether volunteer emergency responders are classified as employees under State law within these States. In the States with OSHA-approved State Plans, each State determines what types of volunteer emergency responders it covers, and to what extent they are covered. This determination of coverage is based upon the State's definitions of what volunteers are considered employees and whether or not volunteer organizations are covered by State legislation relating to the OSHA-approved State Plan. Volunteers considered employees by States with OSHA-approved State Plans would be covered by this proposed Emergency Response Standard, because these States are obligated to promulgate a standard that is ``at least as effective'' as OSHA's proposed Emergency Response Standard. Additionally, regardless of State law, any volunteers who receive ``significant remuneration'' in States with OSHA-approved State Plans would also fall within the scope of this standard due to the obligation mentioned above. The NPRM goes on to explain that 20 of the 29 States with OSHA-approved State Plans are assumed to classify volunteers as employees that would be covered by the proposed emergency response standard. Though the NPRM explains a great deal about how volunteers may be covered by the proposed Emergency Response Standard, it leaves a lot of ambiguity. For example, OSHA says they believe that volunteer emergency responders rarely receive compensation substantial enough to render them employees under this ``significant remuneration'' legal test, however they do not provide a definition for ``significant remuneration.'' However, in 2006 the Department of Labor estimated 30 percent of all volunteer firefighters are paid a small fee for each fire call to which they respond. The NVFC is concerned about the accuracy of OSHA's determination that the ``significant remuneration'' threshold would rarely be triggered without them defining what ``significant remuneration'' is. While the NVFC strongly believes the best course of action would be to exempt volunteer firefighters from this proposed Emergency Response Standard, a better metric to define a volunteer based off compensation would be ``20 percent rule'' as defined in the Department of Labor's August 7, 2006 opinion letter, which extends the application of the 20 percent rule to volunteer firefighters. The letter explains ``generally, an amount not exceeding 20 percent of the total compensation that the employer would pay to a full-time firefighter for performing comparable services would be deemed nominal.'' Due to the nature of firefighting and the difficulties faced with recruitment and retention we also suggest that this ``20 percent rule'' exclude the value of overnight lodging in the firehouse while on call, insurance policies that are comparable to those of career firefighters in the region, and length of service award programs (LOSAPs). Additionally, the NPRM says States with an OSHA-approved State Plan do not define ``employee'' in a standard way. Therefore, determining which employees are covered is not straightforward. For example, some States may provide benefits in the form of insurance and tax benefits to volunteers that might affect whether they are considered employees. Some State Plans may also extend OSHA protections to volunteer firefighters but not to volunteer EMS providers or other non- firefighting volunteers, while other State Plans extend OSHA protections to all volunteers or to no volunteers. There are also 4 States and territories in which OSHA was unable to determine whether volunteers are considered employees under their State Plans. The NPRM is also inconsistent with its estimated number of volunteers that would be covered by the proposed Emergency Response Standard. In one part of the NPRM OSHA says the ``of the 1,054,611 emergency responders anticipated to fall within the scope of the proposed rule, 331,472 will be self-identified as volunteers.'' Later, a chart in the NPRM says 187,621 firefighters in volunteer departments and 100,417 firefighters in combination or ``mixed'' departments would be impacted, a total of 288,038 firefighters in volunteer and combination fire departments. The NVFC is also concerned that OSHA is unaware of the varied ways fire departments are funded and how they are organized. Funding can come in the form of local taxes, Federal grants, and/or self- fundraising and the degree to which each of these funding sources make up a fire departments revenue vary greatly. The NVFC is particularly concerned about OSHA not being aware of fire departments that are organized as nonprofit organizations and are unaffiliated with any municipality or political subdivision in States without an OSHA- approved State Plan. Volunteer firefighters in these departments that are compensated in a matter that is consistent with ``significant remuneration'' could fall within the scope of this proposed standard regardless of the State they work in. The NVFC is also very concerned about State-level Departments of Labor being pressured into adopting this proposed standard regardless of whether the State has an OSHA-approved State Plan. The NVFC has heard from our members in States without OSHA-approved State Plans that their State Department of Labor have expressed the possibility that they could be pressured into adopting the proposed Emergency Response Standard if it is adopted by the 20-plus State Plan States. Additionally, the NVFC's membership is very concerned that this proposed Emergency Response Standard may become the standard of compliance for the purpose of seeking municipal/department insurance or for civil litigation regardless of the State a municipality and fire department are located in. In reviewing the NPRM for OSHA's proposed emergency response standard, the NVFC believes OSHA does not adequately meet the SBAR panel's recommendation of clearly explaining which volunteer departments and firefighters would be impacted by this standard. The NVFC also believes that OSHA does not have a complete understanding of how far-reaching the scope this proposed Emergency Response Standard could have on the volunteer fire service. The NVFC therefore recommends that the volunteer fire service be excluded from OSHA's proposed Emergency Response Standard. economic feasibility All- and mostly-volunteer fire departments, protect 82 percent of the Nation's communities and 30 percent of the population. Small rural communities are almost exclusively protected by volunteers. According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), most volunteer firefighters (95 percent) serve in departments that protect fewer than 25,000 people. Approximately half (48 percent) of volunteer firefighters are with small, rural departments that protect fewer than 2,500 people. Many fire departments, especially small volunteer departments, face major obstacles such as basic staffing and equipment needs. National needs assessments of the Nation's fire service consistently show that volunteer departments have difficulty affording up-to-date equipment, training, and apparatus. This is primarily for economic reasons. Because fire protection services are funded at the local level, the resources available to each department are dependent on the local tax base, or the capability to fundraise, which can be very restrictive and limited in small, rural communities. Additionally, some departments are entirely self-funded with fundraising efforts like pancake breakfasts, chicken dinners, and bingo nights. When a single piece of apparatus can cost $1 million or more, these poses a tremendous challenge. These efforts are often labor- intensive with low yields. The SBAR panel recommended to OSHA that they do more to take into account the economic feasibility of this proposed Emergency Response standard on departments that self-fundraise. The NVFC believes the NPRM still doesn't adequately accomplish this. The NVFC conducted a survey of our membership and asked about department budgets. Of the 1,766 responses we received 18.5 percent said their department's budget was less than $50,000, and an additional 10 percent said their department's budget is between $51,000 and $75,000. The profile of a typical call/volunteer fire department in a Massachusetts Town of 2,500 people or less is as follows: 17 Call or Volunteer Firefighters on Staff 0 Part-Time Firefighters on Staff 0 Career Firefighters on Staff 2 Auxiliary or Support Firefighters 1 Junior Firefighter/Explorer 2 Dedicated EMS Providers (who are not firefighters) Has an annual budget of $74,932 Spends $2,926 per year on training Serves a community with a population of 1,342 people Provides EMS First Response/First Aid Provides no Ambulance. Operating with an average annual budget of about $75,000, these fire departments barely subsist and have no financial capacity to do anything more. These departments struggle to pay for fuel, maintain their trucks and building, and purchase basic replacement gear and supplies. The 2021 SBAR panel recommend that OSHA make the proposed standard less prescriptive and more scalable with performance-based provisions, where practical, and where possible tailor the standard for small and volunteer fire departments. Though OSHA did make some effort to make this proposed emergency response scalable, much more needs to be done. It is infeasible to have a department similar to the one described above adhere to an Emergency Response Standard that is nearly identical to the Emergency Response Standard that a large, well-funded department such as Boston has to comply with. Massachusetts fire departments cannot grow much beyond 2.5 percent per year because State law caps municipal tax levy increases to 2.5 percent per year, unless the town votes at an election to increase the levy beyond 2.5 percent. Many other States have similar caps. This means that the typical Massachusetts department sees its budget increase no more than about $1,875 per year. Department budgets are not keeping up with inflation. To make up the difference between income and expenses, these departments often have to fundraise or apply for grant funding. This becomes increasingly difficult when a department of this size has to purchase additional equipment or an apparatus like a fire truck which can add thousands to millions of dollars in expense to a department budget. The Colorado Fire Service recently estimated that the average cost to equip a single firefighter with bunker coat, bunker pants, and boots is $4,600 and this rises to $16,500 when you include self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). This financial squeeze on small departments has only been made worse by increasing prices. Between 2018 and 2023 the average cost of turnout gear increased by approximately 35-40 percent, while the cost of SCBA increased by 32 percent. Some of the specific challenges revealed in the most recent NFPA Needs Assessment of the U.S. Fire Service include major issues providing firefighters with personal protective clothing (PPC) and personal protective equipment (PPE). In fact, more than half of all fire departments cannot equip all personnel with SCBAs. Departments protecting less than 10,000 people have the highest rates of unmet need for necessary and life-saving SCBA equipment. When it comes to PPC availability in the smallest departments, 75 percent have at least some PPC that is older than the 10-year life span recommended by the NFPA and 57 percent of all fire departments cannot afford to equip all their responders with wildland fire PPC. Volunteer fire departments also face major challenges with staffing, recruitment, and retention. Between 2010 and 2020 the number of volunteer firefighters Nation-wide dropped 12 percent. Since 2000, the percentage of firefighters over the age of 50 serving in communities with populations of 2,500 or fewer residents has surged from 18.9 percent to 34 percent. In some areas around the country, there are communities where the entire volunteer fire department is over 50 years old. Understaffed departments do not have the human resources needed to implement broad-sweeping requirements such as those outlined in the proposed standard. Doing so would further increase the time burden placed on volunteers and exacerbate the recruitment and retention problem. Some of the largest factors impacting retention and recruitment of firefighters are the transformation taking place across rural America, along with increased mental and physical fatigue. As jobs leave small towns and young people move to the cities and suburbs in search of work, there are fewer people available to volunteer as emergency responders. As call volumes have risen and the amount of training required to serve as a firefighter has increased, it is increasingly difficult to convince people to volunteer. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic, increased hazmat incidents caused by lithium-ion batteries, increasing wildland fires, and other factors have all made being a firefighter more taxing and the need for additional firefighters more pressing. Federal grants and national organizations like the NVFC have done a great deal to assist volunteer departments in receiving the resources they need, but as seen in the data provided above there is still a large, unfulfilled need for these resources. The most important Federal grant programs that assist fire departments in achieving a baseline level of readiness are the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) and Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) grants which are managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA). AFG and SAFER are competitive grant programs that provide funds to fire departments to help them reach a baseline level of preparedness. Through AFG, local departments receive funding to purchase training, equipment, and apparatus as well as pay for health and safety programs. Through SAFER funds, local departments can pay for hiring career firefighters or for recruiting and retaining volunteer firefighters. While AFG and SAFER grants have been very successful, there is not nearly enough funding available for these programs to adequately address the fire service's need for equipment, training, and staffing. Since fiscal year 2011, funding for both AFG and SAFER has fallen by $81 million for each program going from $405 million to $324 million. In fiscal year 2024 alone, each program was cut by $36 million. In fiscal year 2022, FEMA received approximately $2.4 billion in AFG grant applications for only $324 million in available funding, 10 percent of AFG funding is used for Fire Prevention and Safety grants, and approximately $2.8 billion in SAFER funding applications for only $360 million in available funding. Additionally, Congress has allowed the authorizations of AFG and SAFER lapse as of the end of fiscal year 2023 and still hasn't passed reauthorization legislation with the September 30 statutory sunset date for these programs less than 4 months away. Regardless of whether this standard is adopted as written, the NVFC urges Congress to pass the reauthorization of AFG and SAFER grants without delay and to increase funding for each of these critically important grant programs. The NPRM estimates the average cost of OSHA's proposed Emergency Response Standard to be an average approximately $14,000 for each volunteer department. Absent a dramatic increase in AFG and SAFER funding, volunteer departments would not be able to comply with this proposed standard. Volunteers still step up to the plate every day to stretch every dollar, by paying for gear and training out of their own pocket and providing maintenance on trucks just to get them out the door. The NVFC has also done its best to assist volunteer departments in receiving the resources they need with protective PPE and helmet giveaways, small grant programs made possible by our corporate partners, a Mental Health Helpline, free training, and numerous guides and resources. Through a SAFER grant, the NVFC also established the Make Me a Firefighter program (MMAF), the first and only national recruitment and retention campaign to help departments maintain or increase staffing levels. However, like the Federal funding available, the need for these resources is greater than what can be provided. With our understanding of the Nation's volunteer fire service and the data provided above, the NVFC strongly believes that many volunteer fire departments throughout the country will not be able to comply with OSHA's proposed emergency response standard. This lack of compliance will not be due to inconvenience or a lack of desire. The staffing and funding needed to do this just doesn't exist. This standard would not meet its goal of improving firefighter safety if it sets impossible standards for departments to meet. Additionally, the small departments referenced above are often the only emergency responders within miles and sometimes hours of response time away. More firefighters and communities will be placed at risk if they are required to comply with this prohibitively difficult standard in order to operate as department resources would be stretched even thinner, and some departments would be forced to close. The NPRM also argues that this proposed rule is not an unfunded mandate on State or local government because the agency's standards do not apply directly to State and local governments. To make this argument OSHA says that it is only States with voluntarily adopted an OSHA-approved State Plan that must adopt a standard at least as effective as the Federal standard that applies to State and local government agencies. However, it is unrealistic to assume that States would be easily able opt out of their OSHA-approved State Plans because of this proposed rule. Therefore, the NVFC believes this proposed rule would effectively be an unfunded mandate. The NPRM does concede that OSHA is concerned with the potential ``downstream'' economic impact the proposed rule may have on emergency response organizations with volunteer responders. Through the NPRM, OSHA encourages stakeholders to engage with local and State officials about reducing potential impacts of the proposed Emergency Response Standard. In the NPRM, OSHA says it understands that negative financial impacts on volunteer emergency response entities could have undesirable public safety implications. OSHA also says that they considered the possibility of excluding certain categories of emergency response organizations from certain provisions of the proposed rule based on organization size, funding source, and/or the number of emergencies responded to each year. However, OSHA said they decided not to because it was unable to determine any appropriate exclusions in light of their obligation to ameliorate significant risks to employees where economically feasible. The NVFC believes the data expressed above about the economic infeasibility of this proposed standard should make a sufficient argument for volunteer firefighters to be excluded from the proposed standard. particularly burdensome requirements contained in the proposed standard As mentioned previously in this testimony, the proposed Emergency Response Standard contains numerous requirements that would be prohibitive and economically infeasible for volunteer departments to comply with. Particularly problematic would be the incorporation by reference of over 20 NFPA and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) industry consensus standards. The incorporation of these standards by reference would pose a number of issues. First, most of these standards are updated every 3 to 5 years and if a current standard is incorporated by reference into the proposed standard, it will remain fixed and require a Federal Register notice to be updated within the Emergency Response Standard. Second, NFPA is in the process of consolidating many of its standards and it is not clear how these standards would be impacted if they're incorporated by reference and are consolidated into other standards afterwards. Third, is the lack of access to these standards. NFPA standards are available to view for free on-line, but printed copies of these standards are not free. This limited access of NFPA standards is particularly problematic since many volunteer fire departments in rural areas lack reliable internet access. Finally, the NVFC believes these industry consensus standards are excellent as best practice that departments should strive to comply with as much as resources permit them to do so. The NVFC also has great respect for the process through which these standards are produced and has representatives on over 20 NFPA technical committees that inform the content of these standards. However, many volunteer fire departments doe not have the economic, staffing, and administrative resources to comply with these standards and the NVFC strongly believes they should not become law by being completely or partially incorporated by reference into OSHA's proposed emergency response standard. Some standards incorporated by reference that would be particularly burdensome include NFPA 1582. NFPA 1582 contains provisions for an occupational medical program that is designed to reduce risks and provide for the health, safety, and effectiveness of firefighters while performing emergency operations. For AFG grant award purposes, the estimated cost an NFPA 1582 medical exam between $1,200 and $1,400, however many NVFC members have been quoted much higher costs for these physical exams for firefighters and per the economic data above, would be overwhelming for many departments. Incorporation of this standard is an example of where OSHA tried to make the proposed Emergency Response Standard scalable, only requiring a full NFPA 1582 medical exam after a firefighter is exposed to 15 combustion products exposure events per year. However, the NVFC would like more clarity on what the definition of a combustion products exposure event. Another burdensome standard partially incorporated by reference into this proposed standard would be NFPA 1910. NFPA 1910 contains requirements for establishing an inspection, maintenance, refurbishment, and testing program for emergency service vehicles and marine firefighting vessels and provides the minimum job performance requirements including the requisite knowledge and skills for emergency vehicle technicians. Incorporating this standard by reference would require all fire apparatus to be inspected weekly or within 24 hours of responding to an emergency. Inspections would have to be conducted by staff who are trained in chassis inspection. This would also require periodic comprehensive, diagnostic inspections of up to 70 components within an apparatus. This could be prohibitive for small departments that have a single apparatus and lack the staffing and expertise to conduct such an inspection. NFPA 1021 would also be incorporated by reference into the proposed Emergency Response Standard. This is the standard for fire officer professional qualifications and contains the minimum job performance requirements including the requisite knowledge and skills to perform fire officer duties through 4 progressive levels of qualification. Level 1 is a tier for an entry level/first-line supervisor, company officer, or team leader. Level 4 is the top level or top tier for the chief. Incorporation of this standard by reference would again fall into the burdensome one-size-fits-all approach of this Emergency Response Standard. These courses require hours of training in addition to the hundreds of hours of training volunteers have to go through while balancing career and family obligations. Additional training requirements can severely impact recruitment and retention efforts, therefore much care needs to be taken in evaluating what training is essential for officers in small volunteer departments. In many cases, the NFPA 1021 courses provide training that are not essential to officers in these departments. Additionally, availability of training is a particularly large obstacle many volunteers face, specifically those in rural areas. In speaking with NVFC members and other fire service stakeholders, the NVFC has learned that NFPA 1021 Fire Officer 3 training is only offered in 26 States. Unfortunately, this lack of availability is not unique to Fire Officer 3. The NFPA standards mentioned above only address a small portion of the burdens small volunteer departments would be faced with if over 20 industry consensus standards are completely or partially incorporated by reference into OSHA's notice of proposed Emergency Response Standard. There are also other requirements outside these standards included in OSHA's proposed rule that would be extremely burdensome to volunteer departments. These include a number of written planning requirements and procedures that require administrative staff and expertise that small volunteer departments lack. Additionally, such expertise may not be available in rural areas and may require expensive outside consultants. There would also be a number of on-scene requirements like identifying and clearly labeling control zones that again would require time and personnel that many small volunteer departments would not have when arriving on scene. Finally, the implementation time line for the proposed standard ranges from 2 months to 2 years depending on the paragraph. Volunteer departments, particularly small departments in rural areas would not be able to comply with this time line. As previously mentioned, many of these departments would not be able to comply with certain provisions in this standard at all, while other provisions would require at least a decade for volunteer departments to comply with. conclusion The NVFC again thanks the Subcommittee on Emergency Management and Technology for holding this important hearing and for the opportunity to testify. We also thank Chair or Commissioner D'Esposito for his years of service as a volunteer firefighter and his leadership in ensuring volunteer firefighters can safely perform the duties, while not compromising their ability to serve their communities. While we appreciate OSHA's commitment to firefighter safety, for the reasons explained in this testimony, the NVFC urges OSHA to exempt the volunteer fire service from their proposed Emergency Response Standard. The NVFC looks forward to working with OSHA on ways we can promote firefighter safety without compromising emergency response in communities served by volunteer fire departments. Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you, sir. I now recognize Mr. Davis for 5 minutes to summarize his opening statement. STATEMENT OF EVAN DAVIS, DIRECTOR, GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS, INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FIRE FIGHTERS Mr. Davis. Good morning, Chairman D'Esposito, Ranking Member Carter, and Members of the subcommittee. My name is Evan Davis, and I serve as director of government affairs for the International Association of Fire Fighters. On behalf of General President Ed Kelly and our 345,000 firefighters and EMS personnel, thank you for holding today's hearing to examine OSHA's proposed ERS. We can all agree that firefighting is a dangerous profession, and much more needs to be done to protect our firefighters. Each year, approximately 60,000 firefighters are injured on the job and another hundred are killed. Together, these incidents have a cost of $3 billion per year, and that doesn't account for the life-long pain, suffering, and losses in quality of life that accompany these injuries. Simply put, our reliance on consensus standards with no teeth and the good will of city administrators alone to protect us is literally killing us. Unlike nearly every other industry, firefighters have almost no enforceable workplace protections. Before the ERS, the best protection we had was a limited standard aimed at private fire brigades that hadn't been updated since Jimmy Carter was President. We applaud OSHA for answering our decades-old call to update these protections and doing so in a manner that is almost unprecedented in its transparency, its commitment to stakeholder input, as evidenced by the repeated delays OSHA's already provided in the comment process. The ERS looks daunting, that's true, but the fact is it's based on common-sense standards that most fire departments are already practicing or are well on the way to doing so. The backbone of this document is an understanding that firefighters must be prepared for known hazards in their communities, fully trained and healthy, and equipped with safe vehicles and equipment. It's horrifically depressing to see how many line-of-duty injuries and deaths we have each year due to preventible circumstances. In 2009, a Boston ladder truck lost its brakes going down a hill, striking a building, killing 1 firefighter and severely injuring 3 others. The fire truck had 3 prior instances of brake failure, including once on the exact same hill. Subsequent investigations found that the fire department had no preventative maintenance program and no fleet manager. If this happened in one of the largest cities in the country, what challenges are facing firefighters in your own districts? It's 2024, and we firmly believe we need to require fire trucks to have working brakes. Last year, two Newark, New Jersey, firefighters were killed on a shipboard fire. Newark often ran two-person firefighter crews and provided their firefighters with zero training in shipboard fire attack, despite being home to the fourth-busiest port in the Nation. Again, in the year 2024, how are we not preparing for known hazards like the fourth-busiest port in the Nation? I could go on about DOD firefighters falling through their station floors that are crumbling, firefighters dying from ladder trucks that are collapsing because the truck is decades old, and 9 South Carolina firefighters dying on a single incident because there was no clear incident command and no effective standard operating procedures. Our industrial members work for private EMS companies and are equally at risk. We applaud OSHA for expanding the ERS to include those personnel as well. We must continue to hold for-profit companies accountable when they prioritize profits over the safety and dignity of our members. The ERS is based on industry consensus standards that simply say we should be fully staffed and trained, we should be healthy and resourced to prevent our own suicides, and we should have safe fire stations. These recommendations came from a panel of fire service experts in 2014, and all national fire service organizations sat at that table and developed those recommendations. The full NACOSH committee later adopted those proposals unanimously, and that was the backbone and the basis for this document. Now, we recognize the ERS does have a cost to it, and, quite candidly, that challenge is a lot harder since Congress has slashed the AFG and SAFER grant programs by 10 percent in the fiscal year 2024 appropriations bill, and the continued inability to reauthorize these grant programs is an additional challenge. But let's be clear: Money will be spent one way or the other. Agencies can invest in safety on the front end or they can pay extra billions of dollars in the back end for preventible injuries and deaths. For those cities and agencies and companies that say they've never had a serious injury and they can't afford to make the change, we say the data is clear: They haven't had a serious incident yet. If cities and municipalities and companies continue to ignore safety, their luck will run out, and our members will be the ones that are forced to pay the price. But it's important to recognize two things can be true at the same time: This ERS can advance safety, and some small agencies may have trouble implementing it. One positive aspect is that OSHA acknowledges genuine efforts by employers to improve safety. So jurisdictions simply writing off compliance altogether ignore the fact that OSHA does recognize good-faith efforts to achieve compliance. Slow progress is better than no progress, and we urge agencies to begin improving safety today. Last, I'd like to make it clear that these investments in our safety correlate directly with our ability to serve the public. The public rightfully expects that when they call 9-1- 1, we will show up to their house ready and able to work. A fire department without healthy, trained, and equipped personnel is just giving their community a false sense of security that will go up in smoke. This ERS fundamentally supports the link between firefighter safety and public safety. Thank you again for holding this hearing, and I look forward to talking with you more about how we can fix the broken status quo.  Prepared Statement of Evan Davis June 4, 2024 Chairman D'Esposito, Ranking Member Carter, and Members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today about the need to establish legally-enforceable protections that ensure fire fighter safety and our ability to serve our communities. My name is Evan Davis, and I serve as director of government affairs for the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF). I am honored to hold a leading role in developing our legislative and regulatory strategies to ensure IAFF members stay safe on the job and have the tools and resources they need to perform their duties effectively. While the IAFF is active in many policy areas, none is more important than our efforts to advance fire fighter safety. Since the founding of the IAFF in 1918, we have stood at the leading edge of nearly every advancement in fire fighter safety. OSHA's development of a basic, legally enforceable workplace safety standard for our members is one of these watershed moments in the history of firefighting. The IAFF represents nearly 350,000 professional fire fighters and emergency medical services (EMS) personnel serving at the local, State, and Federal levels. Our members serve communities in all 50 States and protect 70 percent of the United States' population.\1\ Professional fire departments protect nearly all communities with populations of more than 50,000.\2\ The IAFF's members are our Nation's all-hazards emergency responders and protect their communities from a wide range of emergencies, including structural fires, wildland fires, building collapses, natural disasters, terrorist incidents, and more. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ National Fire Protection Association.

Table 14. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- While the IAFF is active in many policy areas related to our members, our top priority is to protect our members' safety on the job and ensure their ability to serve their communities. The lack of legally enforceable safety standards for fire fighters is a glaring omission that must be corrected. Our union applauds the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for proposing a landmark standard to usher in a new level of safety for fire fighters and their communities. OSHA's commitment to public input and openness in developing the standard should be commended. Firefighting is a dangerous occupation. The data described below and cited throughout the OSHA proposal is confirmation that poorly- enforced safety standards are killing and injuring emergency responders in the line of duty. OSHA's proposed Emergency Response Standard (ERS) recognizes that we cannot rely on local and State governments' goodwill alone to protect fire fighters. In a race to slash budgets, fire fighters and public safety have emerged as the losers. We need the ERS to reinforce our safety and affirm safe and efficient operations as the backbone of every fire department. overview of the american fire service Today's fire service provides an all-hazards response role and serves communities of all sizes. The IAFF's nearly 350,000 members represent approximately 34 percent of the Nation's 1.1 million fire fighters.\3\ These men and women protect their communities from various emergencies, including fires, medical emergencies, motor vehicle accidents, hazardous materials incidents, technical rescue situations, natural disasters, and terrorism. In 2020, American fire departments responded to more than 36.4 million calls for service.\4\ More than 23.8 million of these calls, or roughly 65 percent, were for medical emergencies.\5\ Fire fighters cross-trained as EMS personnel are the backbone of America's pre-hospital EMS system. Fire departments are the most common type of EMS agency and are the providers of EMS care in more than 90 percent of communities with populations over 50,000. On a national level, 65 percent of communities receive EMS from their fire department.\6\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \3\ U.S. Fire Administration.

Our brothers and sisters are being killed due to complacency, negligence, and balancing municipal budgets on the backs of fire fighters. Below is a detailed discussion of the unacceptable injuries and deaths that plague our industry. Nearly all national fire service organizations--labor and management, professional and volunteer--are actively involved in developing the NFPA standards, training curricula, and best practices that guide our industry. Generally speaking, these documents are accepted as the goals for which all fire departments strive. However, there are virtually no legal requirements for fire departments to adhere to these standards. Requirements for governments to ensure proper staffing levels, safe vehicles, and effective protective equipment largely exist only in fire departments' liability insurance policies and an agency's Insurance Services Office (ISO) rating. It is unacceptable for nearly every other industry to have OSHA protections, yet fire fighters must rely on ISO recommendations to ensure their survival. Communities should never be lulled into a false sense of security, thinking that they are protected by a fire department, when in reality, that agency is ill-prepared due to poor staffing levels, outdated equipment, and emergency response vehicles that should have been retired decades ago. line-of-duty deaths among fire fighters As all-hazards response professionals, fire fighters and EMS professionals work dangerous jobs fighting fires, providing EMS, or mitigating hazardous materials releases. Despite our best efforts to reduce occupational hazards, line-of-duty deaths and injuries continue to plague the fire service. According to the U.S. Fire Administration, our Nation lost 94 fire fighters in the line of duty in 2022.\9\ This number has generally held steady when looking at the overall number of fire fighters lost each year. These deaths are nearly evenly split between professional fire fighters (48 percent) and volunteer fire fighters (52 percent).\10\ These death rates are a testament to the dangers fire fighters face--regardless of whether they receive a paycheck--and the need for us to do better to protect the men and women who serve their communities each day. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \9\ US Fire Administration. Annual Report on Firefighter Fatalities in the United States. https://www.usfa.fema.gov/statistics/reports/ firefighters-departments/firefighter-fatalities.html. \10\ OSHA Proposed Emergency Response Standard. Table VII-A-2. Pg. 7779. https://www.Federalregister.gov/documents/2024/02/05/2023-28203/ emergency-response-standard. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- However, we believe the true number of fire fighters killed in the line of duty is significantly higher when considering the toll that occupational cancer takes. In September, the IAFF held our annual Fallen Fire Fighters ceremony, and we honored 173 IAFF members who succumbed in 2022 to occupational cancer.\11\ These deaths must be recognized as line-of-duty deaths and included in the statistics that guide decision making and policy making for our industry. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \11\ International Association of Fire Fighters. https:// www.iaff.org/news/iaff-fallen-fire-fighter-memorial-honors-more-than- 500-members/. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regardless of which number is recognized, these deaths are too common and could have been prevented in many cases. It is especially staggering to note that OSHA statistics show that 14 percent of these deaths occurred during training activities \12\--a time when risks should be most controlled. The failure to prevent such a substantial number of fire fighter deaths should stop us in our tracks and force us to find a safer way. Industry best practices can only do so much. We need a comprehensive safety standard to ensure our brothers and sisters go home every day. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \12\ OSHA. Table VII-A-2. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- staggering rates of occupational injuries As troubling as these death rates are, the frequency and severity of fire fighter injuries are even more startling. In 2022, an estimated 65,650 fire fighters were injured on the job. Most were fireground injuries such as overexertion, falls, and sprains/strains. However, more than 16,000 injuries occurred in circumstances other than active fire suppression, such as when traveling to/from an emergency incident or during training activities.\13\ Vehicle accidents are also a common threat to fire fighters' safety. In 2022, more than 20,000 collisions involving fire department apparatus occurred, directly resulting in more than 800 injuries.\14\ When looking at the complete picture presented by these data, it is clear that current safety precautions are not meeting fire fighters' needs. Our industry cannot continue to view these injuries as the cost of doing business. America's fire fighters and EMS personnel demand for OSHA to help us create a safer atmosphere. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \13\ National Fire Protection Association. US Firefighter Injuries. December 2023. https://www.nfpa.org/en/Education-and-Research/Research/ NFPA-Research/Fire-Statistical-reports/Firefighter-injuries-in-the- United-States. \14\ Ibid. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- These injuries are more than just statistics; they can take profound and life-long tolls on individual fire fighters. These injuries often force fire fighters to endure life-long effects, such as chronic pain, reduced mobility, and even substance abuse. The IAFF operates our Center of Excellence, which assists fire fighters who are struggling with substance abuse and dependency issues, among other behavioral health concerns. Often, these challenges arise for fire fighters following a serious line-of-duty injury.\15\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \15\ International Association of Fire Fighters. Substance Abuse. https://www.iaffrecoverycenter.com/substance-abuse/. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- OSHA's ERS takes meaningful steps toward reducing these rates of injuries by requiring fire departments to complete written plans detailing how they will handle risk management (Paragraph F), pre- planning incident response (Paragraphs M-N), incident operations and management (Paragraphs O-P), and the development of standard operating procedures (Paragraph Q). Most importantly, we applaud OSHA for ensuring that the front-line emergency responders themselves have a voice in developing these plans (Paragraph E) and using post-incident analyses to inform these plans (Paragraph R). One of the common factors that contribute to so many injuries is the lack of planning, effective incident management, and safe staffing levels. In 2007, the Charleston (SC) Fire Department suffered an unimaginable loss when 9 fire fighters were killed when responding to a fire in the Super Sofa furniture store. Post-incident analyses identified a lack of pre-planning and failure to adhere to incident management protocols as two leading factors for this tragic incident.\16\ All of these points would be addressed in the various components of the OSHA ERS. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \16\ NIOSH. Firefighter Fatality Report F2007-18. February 2009. https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/fire/reports/face200718.html. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- These components of the ERS would also help prevent the far more common and non-fatal injuries that hurt fire fighters every day. The OSHA ERS will require fire departments to confront the factors that prevent their adherence to voluntary consensus standards and industry best practices. These pre-planning, staffing, and incident management considerations will help ensure fire fighters have the tools, staffing, and SOPs to prevent them from being over-stretched, under-resourced, and ultimately placed in inherently unsafe positions. Fire fighters in major cities and rural communities alike are often forced to operate with staffing levels far below what is safe. Studies have clearly shown that crew sizes matter. The more fire fighters we can have per crew, the safer and more efficient are their operations.\17\ It should be unacceptable for local governments to allow companies of just 3, or even 2, fire fighters. Our union applauds OSHA for recognizing the importance of crew sizes in the ERS. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \17\ NIST. Firefighter Staffing Studies. 2010 and 2013. https:// www.nist.gov/el/fire-research-division-73300/firegov-fire-service/ staffing-studies. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- We also strongly support Paragraph L of the ERS, which would force fire departments to adopt common-sense vehicle inspection and safety protocols. Far too often, municipalities skimp on vehicle safety due to budgetary reasons. Fire fighters in professional and volunteer departments alike routinely struggle with being forced to use unsafe apparatus that should be pulled from service pending repairs. One of the most notable incidents in this regard occurred in Boston in 2009 when a ladder truck lost its brakes when driving down a steep street and crashed into a building, killing 1 fire fighter, and injuring 3 others. Investigations into this incident found that the City's failure to adhere to proper vehicle maintenance protocols was a major contributing factor.\18\ Sadly, Boston is not unique. Similarly unsafe fire trucks are on the road throughout the Nation, and accidents like this could easily happen again. The OSHA ERS brings common-sense safeguards for fire fighters and their communities by requiring jurisdictions to follow basic vehicle inspection, maintenance, and repair policies. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \18\ NIOSH. Firefighter Fatality Report F2009-5. February 2010. https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/fire/reports/face200905.html. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- mental and behavioral health concerns It is important to note that fire fighters and EMS personnel also experience significantly increased rates of PTSD and other behavioral health conditions because of their service. Studies show that PTSD rates among first responders are 3 times higher than the general population and are roughly equivalent to military veterans.\19\ Just as fire fighters need policies to protect their physical health, they also need help carrying the mental burdens of their jobs. Peer support programs are one such way to assist fire fighters in monitoring their mental health and help them access higher levels of care when the need arises. When left unchecked and untreated, PTSD, depression, and other common behavioral health conditions can deteriorate into behavioral health emergencies such as suicide and dangerous levels of substance abuse.\20\ Just as we would never allow fire fighters to be sent to a fire without an SCBA, we should also demand local governments ensure fire fighters have access to robust programs to monitor and treat any behavioral health concerns they may experience. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \19\ NIST. Technical Note 2078. P. 39. https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/ nistpubs/TechnicalNotes/NIST.TN.2078.pdf. \20\ Ibid. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The IAFF applauds OSHA for recognizing the importance of mental and behavioral health. We firmly support the requirements in Paragraph G for agencies to provide their emergency responders with mental and behavioral health resources, especially following each traumatic emergency incident to which they respond. We are especially grateful for Paragraph (G)(4)(iii) of the proposed ERS, which highlights the importance of connecting emergency responders with clinically competent and informed mental health practitioners who are experienced in treating emergency responders. Fire and EMS professionals have unique needs compared to the general population, and local and State governments must assist them in accessing the most appropriate levels and providers of care. occupational cancer among fire fighters Fire and EMS professionals are exposed to a vast number of toxins and biological threats while performing their duties. Carcinogens are a pervasive threat that our members are exposed to each day. Fire fighters encounter a range of carcinogens in smoke and vehicle exhaust, and even our protective gear is manufactured with added PFAS chemicals. NIST studies have proven that the amount of PFAS released onto fire fighters increases as our turnout gear ages and experiences more wear and tear.\21\ Every time fire fighters don and doff our gear, we experience yet another exposure to known carcinogens. Cancer is so prevalent among fire fighters that the International Agency for Research on Cancer has recognized the occupation of firefighting itself to be a Category 1 carcinogenic exposure.\22\ Sadly, these exposures to carcinogens claim a tremendous number of fire fighters' lives each year. According to our data, nearly two-thirds of fire fighters' line- of-duty deaths each year are due to occupational cancer. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \21\ NIST.

Occupational Exposure as a Firefighter https:// publications.iarc.fr/Book-And-Report-Series/Iarc-Monographs-On-The- Identification-Of-Carcinogenic-Hazards-To-Humans/Occupational-Exposure- As-A-Firefighter-2023. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Given the prevalence of cancer, fire fighters must receive annual cancer screenings so that they have the best chances of catching occurrences of cancer in the earliest stage. The failure of governments to provide annual cancer screenings to fire fighters is deplorable. The IAFF applauds States like New Jersey and New Hampshire, which are aggressively working to provide these much-needed screenings. The meager costs of preventative screenings pale in comparison to the costs associated with treating cancer at a more advanced stage. Paragraphs G and K of the proposed OSHA ERS are essential in combatting the cancer epidemic in the fire service by establishing requirements for regular medical screenings of fire fighters (Paragraph G) and issuing modern, effective personal protective equipment for fire fighters. These provisions within the ERS will be critical tools in our efforts to stem the growth of occupational cancer rates. We also applaud OSHA for recognizing the dangers of continued usage of PFAS-laden turnout gear and for asking stakeholders about how this should be addressed in the final ERS. While the IAFF is still developing our full comments, we anticipate urging OSHA to continue investigating the connection between PFAS-laden gear and occurrences of occupational cancer for fire fighters. Once PFAS-free gear is available, we will urge OSHA to mandate its adoption and use. One of the few places where we disagree with the ERS is in Paragraph (G) and Question G-2, where OSHA proposed using a benchmark of 15 exposures per year as the criteria for needing an annual medical examination. The IAFF urges OSHA to require all fire fighters and EMS personnel to receive an annual medical examination and cancer screening. Our union has fought for presumptive cancer coverage for fire and EMS personnel because it is impossible to pinpoint which fire caused cancer. Similarly, we feel 15 exposures per year is an arbitrary number. A fire fighter may respond to a single fire per year, but carcinogens will be present in the smoke, and that fire fighter will be at risk for developing cancer. While we plan to yield to local collective bargaining agreements to inform the type of medical examination and handling of subsequent medical records, we do feel that every fire fighter and EMS provider should have some level of annual medical examination--even if it is just for the individual's personal knowledge. costs of occupational injuries for fire fighters When looking at these injuries, it is essential to realize that their impacts extend beyond just the time and place in which they occur. Fire departments across the Nation also incur significant monetary costs as a result. In 2019, the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) published Technical Note 2078 (TN 2078), Economics of Firefighter Injuries in the United States. This document provides us with a comprehensive analysis of the costs of injuries among fire fighters. NIST found that each year, the cost of fire fighter injuries ranges from $1.6 billion to $5.9 billion. NIST concluded that these costs are the equivalent of approximately $50,000 to $200,000 per fire department or $1,500 to $5,500 per individual fire fighter.\23\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \23\ NIST. P. i. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Every time safety advancements have come to the fire service--such as closed cab apparatus or mandating the use of self-contained breathing apparatus--naysayers have always said that we would break fire department budgets and force agencies to close. Yet today, these are all commonly-accepted practices and standards for virtually all fire departments. We recognize that adhering to the ERS has costs. However, as NIST has shown, failure to adhere to safe operating procedures also has costs. If the choice is ultimately whether to spend funds preventing injuries and deaths or responding to them, the choice should be clear. considerations to claimed challenges in complying with the ers When reviewing the comments shared through the Federal Register, it is noteworthy that few commenters argue that the ERS itself will fail to make the fire service safer. It is well-established in the fire service that long-standing life-safety dangers continue to exist and that lives are lost in often preventable situations. The primary opposition to the ERS comes from agencies claiming an inability to meet these safety standards and private companies and town/city/county managers who refuse to invest in the safety of their workforce. Sadly, we recognize that economics always plays a role in funding a host of public services; we are not ignorant of the realities within which both workers and employers live. We also understand that there are some rural and volunteer agencies serving communities with finite funding from their tax base, and that the fire fighters in these communities perform admirable work under challenging circumstances. For the first time in the history of our organization, the IAFF has collaborated on many of the issues that impact all stakeholders in the fire services industry. The stark reality we face is that fire fighter safety, whether professional or volunteer, and the safety of the communities we serve, must be guided by principles and guidelines that place a supreme value on saving lives and protecting communities. This subcommittee should provide no safe harbor to municipalities that risk fire fighter safety, and the safety of their citizenry, because they are costly. Countless IAFF locals are forced by municipal leadership to make unsafe responses with too few fire fighters, outdated apparatus, and ineffective tools and safety equipment. These ill-guided policy positions have cost lives. We look forward to OSHA using the full force of Federal law to protect fire fighter safety when local and State governments fail to do so. Firefighters and communities should never again be forced to tolerate intentionally browned-out firehouses and fire apparatus without working brakes. The IAFF also represents several bargaining units of first responders who work for private companies and are considered workplace emergency response employees (WEREs) under the ERS. These companies must also prioritize safety as a core mission of their corporate identity. Enactment and implementation of the ERS will make a dangerous job safer and will compel all stakeholders to achieve a never-before- seen level of interest in the lives of our Nation's fire fighters. The nomenclature is immaterial, whatever a fire department calls itself, if it is well-enough-resourced to have personnel who receive significant remuneration as defined by the Department of Labor, answer thousands of emergency calls per year, or provide round-the-clock operations in an urban community, it too should be required to meet minimum levels of safety for their personnel. proposed congressional assistance The IAFF recognizes that some jurisdictions may have challenges in meeting the ERS. We urge Congress to increase its investment in the AFG and SAFER programs, the Federal Government's primary forms of support for all fire departments Nation-wide. Since these programs' inception more than 20 years ago, Congress has directed more than $15 billion in assistance to fire departments. Sadly, for fiscal year 2024, Congress slashed funding for AFG and SAFER by 10 percent--reducing the programs' full-year funding level from $370 million each to just $336 million per program. The IAFF and all other national fire service organizations have repeatedly urged Congress to reverse these cuts and make meaningful investments in fire departments by funding these programs at no less than $405 million each in fiscal year 2025. Considering the pending ERS, funding for these programs is more important than ever. We also urge Congress to immediately pass the Fire Grants and Safety Act (H.R. 4090/S. 870) and provide a long-term reauthorization for these grants. Fire departments need to have long-term assurance that these programs will continue beyond the end of this fiscal year. This bill has passed both the House and Senate by overwhelming margins. However, partisan politics is holding up the bill in the Senate. Every Member of this committee ought to be committed to ensuring swift passage of the bill. The IAFF also recommends Congress increase its funding levels for the Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) and the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP) grant programs. These grants play a critical role in ensuring the preparedness of fire departments in 41 major metropolitan areas across the Nation. Funding for UASI and SHSGP helps these agencies have the personnel, apparatus, resources, and training to maintain readiness to respond to acts of terrorism and major disasters. In fiscal year 2024, Congress provided $553.5 million for UASI and $373.5 million for the SHSGP program. As Congress develops its fiscal year 2025 appropriations bills, we urge Congress to provide no less than $615 million for UASI and $520 million for SHSGP. conclusion Safety standards come with financial costs, but so do line-of-duty funerals, PSOB payments, and wrongful death lawsuits. As mentioned earlier, even survivable injuries come at a significant economic cost. A basic industry minimum safety standard, such as the proposed ERS, could significantly reduce these costs. For the IAFF, the choice of where we spend money is clear. The question for this hearing is not whether the fire service is fraught with avoidable injuries and deaths, and whether the ERS identifies safer practices to protect fire fighters and communities alike. The sole question we are wrestling with is whether this ERS should be imposed on local and State governments Nation-wide. The answer is a resounding yes. Jurisdictions have failed to keep our public servants safe, and it is time for them to be forced to take our safety seriously. When municipalities choose to deprioritize our safety and dismiss the needs of their communities, OSHA should be fully empowered to step in and place safety first. Our fire fighters and the communities they serve deserve nothing less than the full support of Congress and the Federal Government. Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you, Mr. Davis. I now recognize Mr. Walker for 5 minutes to summarize his opening statement. STATEMENT OF GRANT WALKER, PRESIDENT, PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY PROFESSIONAL FIRE FIGHTERS AND PARAMEDICS ASSOCIATION, INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FIRE FIGHTERS, LOCAL 1619 Mr. Walker. Good morning, Chairman D'Esposito, Ranking Member Carter, and Members of this esteemed subcommittee. My name is Grant Walker. I am the president of the Prince George's County Professional Fire Fighters and Paramedics Association, IAFF Local 1619, representing the 1,800 active and retired members of my association. Additionally, I currently serve as the legislative policy chair for the Professional Fire Fighters of Maryland, representing the 10,000 IAFF members that reside within the State of Maryland. I want to thank you for the opportunity to testify on this critically important rule making. I started my fire service career shortly after graduating high school in 2004, where I moved into the College Park Volunteer Fire Department as part of the Prince George's County Fire and EMS system. While attending college, I worked full-time and had a regularly assigned shift at the volunteer firehouse, and I was not unique as this program had been in place for many years prior to my arrival. I completed my undergraduate degree in fire science from the University of Maryland in 2009 and began working for the Federal Government as a firefighter at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. I would leave there in 2012 and regain my position in Prince George's County as a firefighter under employment. I currently hold the rank of lieutenant in that fire department. As a recent graduate of the Executive Fire Officer Program from the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg, Maryland, it is critically important that we address this issue. Our Nation's firefighters are facing a crisis of massive proportion. Not a day goes by where a firefighter doesn't experience a lack of staffing, aging apparatus, substandard working conditions, with no discernible standard to turn to. The OSHA standard aims to make significant improvements to that problem. No firefighter should be concerned about whether the working conditions they're subjected to will lead to their injury, illness, or even worse, their death. Too often our firefighters are reliant on the good will of community or elected officials to maintain or update our facilities, apparatus, or personal protective equipment. Our Nation's firefighters need a standard to point to, a place to go when status quo is just not safe. While school systems point to test scores, police forces point to crime statistics, our metrics are more nuanced and are not normally easily converted to the direct impact on a person's everyday life. We measure our successes by our failures in property loss and loss of life. Response times and personnel on the unit are rarely reported or compared from department to department, region to region. In September 2023, Station 820, Upper Marlboro, in my department had an ambulance catch fire in its apparatus bay. Had it not been for the ambulance siren shorting out and causing a loud noise, and then shorting out the electrical system for the doorbell of the fire department, Lieutenant Michael Carey might not be with us today. Fortunately, those things happened, he was able to extricate himself from the window, and he is still serving proudly in our department. Many fire stations across the county are historic or even significant in age and not required to meet the applicable modern fire safety codes. It seems monthly that a piece of apparatus catches fire in a station apparatus bay. We have firefighters from all walks of life who answer the call to serve. Not all these personnel are medically fit to serve. For many, annual medical physicals are the only way they've discovered life-threatening diseases and illnesses. Lieutenant Jeffrey Chandler from my department went in for his annual medical physical and ended up having 2 stints in place the next morning. On the operating table he would go into cardiac arrest. Three weeks later he would have 3 more cardiac stints put in place. Fortunately, Lieutenant Chandler survived and has been able to see his son become a firefighter in Prince George's County Fire Department and watch his grandchildren grow up. Unfortunately, too many firefighters discover their medical illnesses when it's too late. In 2023, 72 percent of all IAFF member line-of-duty deaths were caused by occupational cancer. In 2022, 33 firefighters died of a heart attack. In Prince George's County, annual medical physicals are a benefit as part of our collective bargaining agreement. While our members are fortunate to be in a State with collective bargaining, safety shouldn't be reliant on whether or not firefighters have a contract or if appropriate safety standards are mandated as part of negotiations. Safety should not need to be negotiated. It should be required. Even with the protections of a collective bargaining agreement, aging apparatus and firehouses and substandard working conditions plague most fire departments across the Nation. When money is involved, the committee will understand that there is never enough to go around. Too often fire departments across this Nation are vying for public grants, community funding, like the UASI, SAFER, and AFG grants programs. Not getting one of these grants can mean the difference between a safe piece of apparatus or safe firefighters. We have watched as the prices of apparatus have ballooned, sometimes costing nearly $2 million, not to mention the $3 million to $4 million to take delivery for said apparatus. We've watched manufacturers push back on the idea that PFAS in firefighter gear is safe, even though the science disagrees. We've watched as the IAFF took the lead on developing peer support resources so that when our members were in their darkest hour, they'd be able to seek treatment without the fear of stigma or reprisal. Many of these issues would be corrected by putting in place a standard, one that's been needed for many years, a standard that moves us past the status quo into a realm where every firefighter in America is ready to respond with the appropriate apparatus, facilities, and health that is needed to do this dangerous profession. I look forward to talking with you more and answering any questions you may have.

I am a recent graduate of the Executive Fire Officer Program from the National Fire Academy located in Emmitsburg, Maryland. Our Nation's firefighters are facing a crisis of massive proportions. Not a day goes by where a firefighter doesn't experience a lack of staffing, aging apparatus, substandard working conditions with no discernable standard to turn to. This OSHA standard aims to make significant improvements to that problem. No firefighter should be concerned about whether the working conditions they're subjected to will lead to their injury, illness, or even worse, their death. Too often our Firefighters are reliant on the goodwill of the community or elected officials to maintain or update facilities, apparatus, or personal protective equipment. Our Nation's fire fighters need a standard to point to, a place to go when status quo is just not safe. While school systems point to test scores, and police forces point to crime statistics, our metrics are more nuanced and are not normally as easily converted to the direct impact on a person's everyday life. We measure our successes by our failures in property loss and loss of life. Response times and personnel on a unit are rarely reported or compared from department to department, region to region. In September 2023, Station 820, upper Marlboro, had an ambulance catch fire in its apparatus bay. Had it not been for the ambulance siren shorting out causing a loud noise and the station doorbell going off due to the electrical system going haywire Lt. Michael Carey may not be with us today. Fortunately, Lt. Carey was able to self-extricate out a window and is currently serving alongside my Brothers and Sisters just up the road. Many fire stations across the country are historic or significant in age, and not required to meet the applicable modern fire safety codes. It seems monthly that a piece of apparatus causes a fire in a station apparatus bay. We have fire fighters from all walks of life who answer the call to serve. Not all of these personnel are medically fit to serve. For many annual medical physicals are the only way they discovered life- threatening diseases and illnesses. Lieutenant Jeff Chandler went in for his annual medical physical and ended up having 2 stints placed the next morning. On the operating table he would go into cardiac arrest. Three weeks later he would have 3 more cardiac stints put in place. Fortunately, Lieutenant Chandler survived and has been able to see his son become a firefighter and watch his grandchildren grown. Unfortunately, too many firefighters discover their medical illnesses when it is too late. In 2023 72 percent of all IAFF member line-of-duty deaths were caused by occupational cancer. In 2022 33 firefighters died of a heart attack. In Prince George's County, annual medical physicals are a benefit as part of our collective bargaining agreement. While our members are fortunate to be in a State with a collective bargaining agreement, safety shouldn't be reliant on whether or not firefighters have a contract or if appropriate safety standards are mandated as part of negotiations. Safety should not need to be negotiated, it should be required. Even with the protections of a collective bargaining agreement, aging apparatus and fire houses, and substandard working conditions plague most fire departments across the Nation. When money is involved, this committee will understand that there is never enough to go around. Too often fire departments across this Nation are vying for public grants, community funding like the UASI, SAFER, and AFG Grants programs. Not getting one of those grants can mean the difference between safe responders and not. We've watched as the prices of fire apparatus has ballooned. Sometimes costing nearly $2 million dollars, not to mention the 3 to 4 years it will take for delivery of said apparatus. We've watched a manufacturer's push back on the idea that PFAS in firefighter gear is safe, even though the science disagrees. We've watched as the IAFF took the lead on developing Peer Support Resources so that when our members were in their darkest hour they would be able to seek treatment without the fear of stigma or reprisal. Many of these issues would be corrected by putting in place a standard, one that has been needed for many years. A standard that moves us past the status quo and to a realm where every firefighter in a America is ready to respond with the appropriate apparatus, facilities, and health that is needed to do this dangerous profession. I look forward to talking with you more and answering any questions you may have. Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you, sir. Without objection, the committee will briefly recess and reconvene 10 minutes after the conclusion of the vote series. Thank you.  Mr. D'Esposito. We'll return from recess. I want to thank you all for your time. I tried to make it across as quick as possible after votes. I now recognize myself for 5 minutes of questioning. Just to the witnesses, if we're able to and we have the time, I know that Mr. LaLota and I have another Homeland event to go to, but we will try to do a second round of questioning, depending on who's here. So I'm going to start my questioning for Mr. Davis. First, I want to thank you for not only being here but for the work and the cooperation that you bring to your office. I know that we've worked together on not only this but many other initiatives. So you went through a long list of reasons as to why this new standard is so important, and you talked about 60,000 injured, 100,000 killed, the cost of the issues that we're facing in the fire service. I know what's most important to all of us is make sure that our firefighters are trained, that they're educated, that they're prepared, and that they have everything that he or she needs to keep themself safe, each other safe, and obviously do the job that they're supposed to do. So we also talked about the fact that the Fire Brigades Standard was established in 1980. I wasn't even born yet. Jimmy Carter was President. So obviously there's been no significant updates since then. I know you went through it in 5 minutes, but if you could tell me, what is the most important issue in the 1980 standard that needs to be updated? Mr. Davis. Yes. Congressman, first and foremost, likewise, thank you for all your partnership as well. I can't thank you enough for your leadership in helping us address the issue of PFAS and turnout gear in particular. That is a huge challenge to the health and safety of our members, and looking forward to hopefully getting H.R. 4769 included in a markup in this committee in the near future. Phenomenal question about what is most in need of update. It really truly is hard to pick just one answer. I think health and safety issues are critical to our members. I think when you look at the rates of cancer in the fire service, the number of firefighters we're losing to cancer, particularly ones that would be and could be detected far earlier, those health screenings are really critical. I think a lot of those details of the health screenings are probably best determined at the local level. I think some level of health screening is important. So I think that's certainly one. But I also think recognizing minimum training standards is critically important. You know, a common thing we see in a lot of our line-of-duty death investigations, be it on the career or the volunteer side, are either folks acting beyond their skill level, beyond their certification level, and that is just such an easy area that we can crack that--and get that training to folks. Mr. D'Esposito. I don't want to rush you. I just want to make sure I get to Mr. Denniston. Is there anything in the--and I know that we've had conversations about carve-outs, about having conversations about removing certain things. Is there anything in the proposed standard that you think is completely unnecessary? Mr. Davis. That's for me? Mr. D'Esposito. Yes. Mr. Davis. Yes, yes. I mean, I think one of the biggest challenges and frustrations we have is kind-of an artificial benchmark, that 15 exposure number. It is part of the standard that says if you have 15 or more exposures per year, that's the benchmark at which you need to get some type of medical evaluation. I think our research on not only PFAS and turnout gear, which is not even a smoke exposure, but certainly other products of combustion being what they are, any one exposure could be sufficient to cause cancer in our members. Fifteen is an arbitrary number. We'd love to see that walked down. Mr. D'Esposito. Great. Mr. Denniston, the NFPA reported that risks, training costs, and unpredictable schedules are a barrier to firefighter recruitment. I would argue that in places like New York there are other concerns that we have to recruitment in the volunteer fire service. I mean, people are now working 2 or 3 jobs because they can't afford what is probably one of the highest-tax States in the country. But the supply of volunteer firefighters has decreased from an estimated 120,000 in 2000 to 75,000 today. In your view, how would the OSHA's proposed rule impact firefighter recruitment and retention in order to maintain the volunteer fire service across not only New York State, but I know very important to both Mr. LaLota and I, across Long Island. Mr. Denniston. You know, I think when we look at the proposed rule as written, we're not opposed to the majority of the things that are in there, and we 100 percent agree that a lot of that needs to be done. Our objections, I guess to this point, are in some of the details of that. With the incorporation of those 22 NFPA standards you would take--our basic firefighter training in New York right now is around 124 hours. We've had the Nassau and Suffolk Fire Academies have given us estimates that that would raise that number of hours in training up to 260-plus hours. Our fear is with that I get a volunteer that's interested, they walk in the door, and then I tell them, ``Oh, before you can do anything, I've now got to have you sit through 268 hours' worth of training,'' they're not going to have that time to commit to their local organization, and they're going to go find another place to volunteer. So, again, we firmly believe in training. We think there's a lot of things that need to be done. But we would like to see that worked into the rule itself instead of the incorporation of the standards, which raises to a benchmark that's unobtainable. Mr. D'Esposito. Mr. Denniston, just one last thing, and my time's expired. But I just want to get it on the record that-- and please correct me if I'm wrong--in New York State, the volunteer fire departments, those are considered New York workplaces? Mr. Denniston. That is correct. Because of some court cases that have been established, volunteers are considered employees in New York State. Mr. D'Esposito. Very good. With that, I recognize for 5 minutes the Ranking Member, Mr. Carter. Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Walker, you mentioned in your opening comments about the health concerns, about finding out about these death- defying issues quite by accident. We know that the country's facing a staffing shortage which forces firefighters to work longer hours. It can take a toll on their mental health. Given these challenges, can you paint a picture of how these staffing shortages and extended work hours affect firefighters' safety and mental health? Mr. Walker. Sure. So in Prince George's County last year we had roughly 32,000 hours of mandatory overtime. That's on top of the elected overtime that my members were working. It ends up in marital fights, ends up in missed birthdays, ends up in changed plans at the last minute, having to find child care, having to find someone to put your kid on the bus, take them off the bus. That's a stressor. Anyone with children, anyone that has plans that they've made, having to change them last-minute and find emergency care for your family members is extremely stressful. Our peer support team is the second-largest peer support team in the Nation, and there are calls daily directly linked to mandatory overtime and forced working conditions due to either low staffing or slow hiring practices. At the end of the day, that takes an extremely big toll on our members' ability to be mentally and physically prepared for their workplace. Nobody likes to go into work tired, nobody likes to go into work overworked, and especially not when you're expected to perform at 100 percent all the time. When the bells go off, our citizens expect us to be at our best. When you're working too many hours, without the approved rest periods, it becomes a very burdensome problem, and we see the direct correlation between things like substance abuse, mental health crises, because of those problems. Mr. Carter. Do you think the proposed OSHA rule will help retain staff? Mr. Walker. I do. I think too often a lot of the safety measures that should be put in place have to get overlooked due to either funding mechanisms coming short, there being no requirement for a lot of these things to be put in place. Look, when I started in the fire service 20 years ago, mental health and wellness wasn't something we talked about. Mr. Carter. Unfortunately, we don't talk about it enough in America today. Mr. Walker. Agreed. Mr. Carter. It's a huge issue, and there's a stigma associated with it. We have to do everything in our power to stamp out that stigma, because we know that mental health is a real issue. Like any other issue that plagues us, there's treatment available, and people are not alone, and we need to make sure that we continue to make a comfortable place for people to acknowledge that mental health is not something that is insurmountable and that it's not taboo. Our professionals face it, and certainly firefighters and professionals do as well. Let me ask you real quickly, Mr. Davis, you mentioned in your comments suicide. How prevalent is the issue with suicides within the organizations? Mr. Davis. Thank you, Congressman. Fantastic question. Suicide is a tremendously large problem plaguing fire service. Looking at rates of PTSD and other mental and behavioral health challenges among first responders compared to the average population, I believe the data is around 3 times higher occurrence among first responders than the average person. The IAFF, we're proud to operate the Center for Excellence in Maryland, which is an inpatient treatment facility for first responders, for firefighters. One of the biggest challenges we have is finding bed space for folks who are seeking treatment. We're actively working to try to expand the availability of that treatment. But I think the demand is clearly there, and I'm excited to work with you in any way possible to support---- Mr. Carter. We stand ready to do that also. Real quickly, I've got about 50 seconds left, but I'd like each of you to just briefly give me a quick answer to this. FEMA preparedness grants were pushed to a 10 percent cut. Tell me how has that impacted your--the 10 percent cut to programs, Assistance to Firefighter Grant Program--how has that impacted your operation? Mr. Denniston. Mr. Denniston. I think the Assistance to Firefighter Grant Program is very important for our firefighters, and it gives us some additional initial funding to look at a lot of the things that have been proposed in this standard. So that it's devastating to us when those numbers are cut. Mr. Carter. Mr. Maruca. Mr. Maruca. When the program was, I'll call it, fully funded, it didn't cover what we needed it to cover, and now that it's less, it's difficult. It's difficult on small volunteer organizations that have no support staff to write these grants. They're becoming discouraged. They're trying to write them, but they're not being successful. As the money goes down, they're less successful. It's devastating for us. Mr. Carter. Thank you. Mr. Davis. Mr. Davis. I believe the fiscal year 2023 cycle we had around $2 billion of unmet applications that were rejected. A further 10 percent cut on appropriations for the program just drives that even higher. That's more aging fire trucks that shouldn't be on the road. That's more short-staffed fire departments. Whether it's a career or a volunteer operation, I think every community suffers from that. Mr. Carter. Mr. Walker. Mr. Walker. We currently have a fiscal year 2023 SAFER grant application in for 45 firefighters. I expect that that's also going to be the case for the fiscal year 2024 budget. Without those firefighters, it means the firefighters that you currently have are still working those longer hours, filling in spots that we don't have a firefighter to fill in because the funding wasn't there or the ability to hire those people wasn't there. Mr. Carter. So as we're here to listen and to help, I think I hear you clearly across the board that the 10 percent cut to the Assistance for Firefighters Grant Program is devastating. It's something that hurts you and doesn't help you. So I'm going to reach over to my colleagues on the other aisle and ask that we join forces in working to restore those cuts, because we hear, in a bipartisan way, that this is not something that's Democrat or Republican, but this is about saving lives and preparing, giving you the tools to do your job. My time is expired, Mr. Chairman. I yield. Mr. D'Esposito. The gentleman's time is expired. I now recognize my good friend and colleague from Long Island, Mr. LaLota. Mr. LaLota. Thank you, Chairman. I appreciate it. If adopted as currently written, OSHA's proposed rule will devastate our Nation's volunteer fire departments, decreasing public safety and increasing costs. This has been made clear to me after many meetings with volunteer firefighters in Nassau and Suffolk Counties back on Long Island. Small and volunteer firefighters are crucial in ensuring community safety, especially in suburban and rural underserved communities. These departments often serve as the first line of defense in emergencies, providing rapid response times that can save life and property. Volunteer firefighters demonstrate exceptional dedication, often balancing their service with other jobs and responsibilities. Their presence enhances local resilience, fosters community spirit, and ensures that even the most remote areas can access essential firefighting and emergency services. We all agree, Democrat and Republican, that safety must be a top priority, including the rigorous training, adherence to safety protocols, and the use of proper equipment. But I am increasingly concerned that these new safety standards will force small and volunteer fire departments to shutter, drastically impacting their work to keep our communities safe every day. Gentlemen, thanks so much for being with us here today, and thank you for your dedication to keeping America's communities safe. I'd like to ask a few questions of you to get some more details of how this proposed rule meets the needs of small and volunteer fire departments. Mr. Denniston, I'd like to start with you first, sir. As it relates to safety standards, and in your position as a risk management professional, would it be fair to say that most, if not all, fire departments have a mission statement in which the safety of the community and its firefighters is paramount to their operation? Mr. Denniston. Absolutely. I mean, our No. 1 principle is the safety of our firefighters. We work very hard to do that. We work to the best that we can within the NFPA standards that apply to that, and we do everything we can to increase the safety of our firefighters. We're just concerned with this, as currently written, the level of detail that it would go into would be devastating to our budgets. Mr. LaLota. With that foundation and long-term dedication in mind, do you still see a need to improve emergency responder safety? Mr. Denniston. Absolutely. Again, as we've stated several times, we're not opposed to firefighter safety, and we think a lot of the things that are in this standard are long overdue. We just would like a seat at the table to be able to discuss this and work on some of the details so that we have a piece that's obtainable by all. If it's not obtainable, no one's going to follow it. But if we can work to make it obtainable, then we'll do a better job protecting firefighters. Mr. LaLota. In a few sentences, though, can you describe what's in this rule that you do like and that you do support that would enhance the safety of your members? Mr. Denniston. I think, as several of the panelists have already mentioned here, the physical component of it is very important for our firefighters, and we want to make sure that our firefighters have the proper screening. The problem with the rule as proposed is, by incorporating NFPA 1582, we're going to take the average price of a firefighter physical in my district from $300 up to about $1,300 per firefighter. When I look at the amount of documentation that would be needed for the preplans and all of that kind of stuff, we don't have any paid personnel in my department. So we would have to hire somebody to come in and do that. When I look at the cost of doing that and I look at the cost of the physical increase for my firefighters, I'm taking my $280,000 budget and moving it to $400,000. That is a 42 percent increase in my budget. It's just not obtainable or agreeable to my taxpayers. Mr. LaLota. From where would those funds come if they had to? Mr. Denniston. Again, we would either have to raise taxes 42 percent or, as we mentioned earlier, Congress would have to refund some of the grant programs. But the problem with a grant program is that's a one-time thing. So that may get us through 1 year, it may help us out a little bit, but that's not going to help us to continue doing the level and provide the services that we need to down the road. Mr. LaLota. Thanks. I only have about a minute left, so I just want to shift gears here real quick. OSHA has indicated that the incorporated by reference standards should not be problematic as fire departments already follow them. Can you explain why this would be a problem now? Mr. Denniston. I sit on 2 NFPA tech committees, so I've helped to write 2 of those NFPA standards. I know that from the work on the committee, we build those to be the gold standard. We build them to what everybody should aspire to do in a best- case solution with all the resources available that we want for our departments to meet. Unfortunately, that's not the world that we live in today, and we just don't have the necessary funding. If we had all the time and all the resources, we would be 100 percent in favor of this thing as written. The problem is, we don't have all the time, and we don't have all those resources. Mr. LaLota. Thank you. I appreciate your dedication, you coming to Washington to provide testimony to this committee. It's going to be very useful for us to help balance the needs of ensuring that we have firefighter safety and very awesome community service volunteer fire departments for decades, if not centuries to come. Thank you, Chairman. I yield back. Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you, Mr. LaLota. I now recognize the newest Member of the subcommittee, from New York, Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy. Thank you very much, Chairman D'Esposito, Ranking Member Carter, for holding this hearing, and thank you to the witnesses for testifying here today. Emergency response workers in America face considerable health and safety risks as you all work, and they all work, in dynamic and unpredictable environments. It's critically important that we ensure the safety of all of our first responders, including firefighters who risk their lives every day to keep our communities safe. Unfortunately, current OSHA standards are outdated and incomplete and leave our brave first responders in danger. As it stands, they do not address the full range of hazards facing emergency responders, lag behind changes in protective equipment performance and industry practices, conflict with industry consensus standards, and are not aligned with many of the current emergency response guidelines provided by other Federal agencies. Emergency responders, firefighters, and others are entitled to OSHA safety standards that nearly every other occupation enjoys. As the brother-in-law of a Buffalo firefighter and representing a community in Buffalo that lost Jason Arno, a brave firefighter, in the line of duty just last year, I have serious concerns about what we're dealing with. Again, appreciate you all being here in Washington today. I have a question I'll send to Mr. Davis and Mr. Walker as representatives of the International Association of Fire Fighters. Can you elaborate on the significance of OSHA's proposed Emergency Response Standard, particularly for the 345,000 firefighters and emergency medical workers that you both represent? Mr. Davis. Yes, absolutely. Fantastic. Appreciate the question, Congressman, and thank you so much. This really, I think, represents an unprecedented advancement in safety for firefighters. Again, we are dealing-- again, speaking specifically for the IAFF membership at least-- we're dealing with unfathomable breakdowns in safety for our members, whether it's apparatus failures, whether it's lack of equipment, whether it's lack of staffing levels, lack of basic health resources being provided to our members. It's downright demoralizing when our members look at other industries and see that nearly every other industry has some form of legally enforceable protection and we don't have those basic protections. I think when you do an incredibly dangerous job, you deserve to have at least some semblance of enforceable safety protections. Our EMS personnel also appreciate the extension of this onto the EMS realm as well. EMS practitioners equally face assaults from patients, face difficult working conditions, and to include them in the emergency response proposal was a significant step forward by OSHA. Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Walker. Mr. Walker. I would say that this proposed rulemaking makes a good step forward toward making our workplaces safer and more accountable to that safety. Too often politics comes in between doing what's right, because of lack of funding or special interests that have more political power, slash, will. Quite frankly, the fire service ends up being the forgotten service because we're not flashy, we don't create the bad headlines, we create the good headlines. Too often in politics, it's the squeaky wheel that gets the grease. It's the one that creates more work for the group in front of me that ends up getting more funding. We've seen police forces in the United States, after the summer of 2020, have more funding now than ever before for training and education. I can't say that that's true in the fire service because that money has to come from somewhere. In the State of Maryland, we're pouring money into the Blueprint for Maryland Education. As a husband of a teacher, I support public education, but understand that there's only so much money to go around, and without this applicable standard to be held accountable, we'll continue to be the forgotten service. Mr. Kennedy. Thank you. The firefighter community obviously faces a heightened risk of exposure to toxins and hazardous materials on a daily basis during emergency responses. In this context, DHS preparedness grants play a vital role in supporting initiatives aimed at mitigating these risks and improving the safety and well-being of firefighters. Considering the current challenges faced by the firefighter community, particularly concerning the increased risk of death from exposure to these toxins and other hazardous materials, how crucial are these grants in addressing the issues, and what specific types of funding and resources are needed to better protect those who are serving our communities? Mr. Davis. Fantastic question. You know, I think there's a couple protections we need. Certainly ability to access health screenings, and cancer screenings in particular, is critically important to our members. I think anyone who's had the misfortune of seeing a cancer case play out in front of them knows that recognizing and detecting that cancer in an earlier stage is far easier to treat and far more successful to treat than a more advanced stage. We're very grateful Congress in the FAA reauthorization bill provided a very large sum of money to help transition away from PFAS-laden firefighting foams, or AFFF. I think that goes a long way in terms of reducing our members' exposures to PFAS. I mentioned earlier we've got some legislation out there to spur development of next-generation turnout gear. That is of critical importance. NIST studies have shown that PFAS is there. More wear and tear of gear exposes our members to more PFAS, which leads to cancer cases, and would love to crack that--and work with you all on getting there. Mr. Kennedy. Thank you. Mr. D'Esposito. All right. The gentleman's time is expired. I now recognize, from the State of Oklahoma, Mr. Brecheen. Mr. Brecheen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the witnesses being here in regard to OSHA and this proposed rule. Mr. Denniston, you represent, even though you're from New York--now, coming from Oklahoma, most people from my State would think of New York and think high population density. But in reading your bio information, you represent--apart from representing rural fire departments with the association that you have an official position with, you are involved in a 2,500 rural fire department. You have a position there. I heard you say just a minute ago, if this new OSHA rule takes effect, you're looking at a 40 percent budget cut. Is that correct? Mr. Denniston. It would be a 40 percent increase--42. We'd have to raise taxes 42 percent. Mr. Brecheen. I'm sorry. That's correct. That's what you said, a 40 percent. You'd have to find 40 percent more of almost a $2 million annual budget? Is that what I remember reading, that you have like a---- Mr. Denniston. Two hundred eighty thousand dollars. Mr. Brecheen. OK. I saw 1.7 million---- Mr. Denniston. One-point-seven is the estimated number in the OSHA document that they say is the average budget for career and volunteer departments. Mr. Brecheen. OK. But yours is 200. I got it. Mr. Denniston. Ours is 280,000. Mr. Brecheen. OK. Mr. Denniston. We're fairly representative of upstate rural New York. Mr. Brecheen. OK. What's interesting, also part of your commentary was that you just went to Indiana and you had only, like, 8 out of 20 different fire chiefs that you're presenting this information, talking about this 605-page document, that you only had just a handful of fire chiefs that knew they had a 90-day window to read this 600-page document that took OSHA 2 years to write. How many fire departments do you think Nation-wide--I know Indiana is an odd sample--but do you think most fire departments even today, here we are the first part of June, how many fire departments do you think actually know about this? Mr. Denniston. I think we're doing a better job communicating this to the fire departments and they're starting to catch on. We were at FDIC, which is one of the premier fire conferences in the country, just a few weeks ago, and couldn't believe the number of firefighters that we talked to, when we asked them what they were doing about the proposed OSHA document, ``What are you talking about? We don't know anything about it. We haven't heard about it.'' It really hasn't garnered the attention in the press and the publications, and the smaller rural departments are just not aware. That's why we've asked. We appreciate the two extensions that have been given so far by OSHA for our comments, but we think we've got a long way to go. Then, as people digest this 608 pages, they feel like they don't have time--enough time--to look at it, digest it, and make meaningful comments, so they just kind-of throw their hands up and walk away. Mr. Brecheen. What do you think the average American, if they studied their Constitution and tried to look in Article I and find, ``I can't lay my finger on that power that's been granted to Congress to get involved in telling rural fire departments what they can do''? Now, Army, Navy, militia, letters of marque and reprisal, that's a little different deal. You can find that in the Constitution. But is it not just lunacy this Federal Government is marching toward a place where we're taking away from State and local entities authority over how they run governance? Mr. Denniston. You know, it could be argued that this certainly borderlines on that or oversteps those bounds. But, again, the majority of us are not opposed to what OSHA is trying to do. We are not opposed to firefighter safety. We have some questions on the way the process was conducted and how we've been able to respond to it. We need adequate time, and we'd like a seat at the table so that we can express and look at each one of these pieces and decide what is feasible and make a rule that's obtainable for all. Mr. Brecheen. You all represent enforcement, emergency response, the broader--people group you in their mind with law enforcement and just the images of what you portray in protecting and serving communities. I think it's also important for this narrative to be built among my colleagues that because we do believe in the rule of law, if the Tenth Amendment is there and it says the power is not delegated by the United States in the Constitution to the Congress, it should be left to the States. The Tenth Amendment is very plain. So I would say to you that in an effort to help you all, I think you're the best positioned to determine the safety for those that you work with on a day-to-day basis. I think the States are the best poised to make these determinations. I think the thing that we need to be shouting from the rooftops in Washington, DC, is we are headed toward bankruptcy as a country because we continue to do things the Constitution never gave us permission under the rule of law to do. It's because we support law enforcement that we want to make sure, operating under the rule of law, that these boundaries that our Founders left us, that we empower you to protect and serve without Federal interference. With that, I appreciate you being here today. I hope that we, through the Congressional Review Act, can put a stop to this. With that, Mr. Chairman, I would yield. Mr. D'Esposito. The gentleman yields. I now recognize my friend from New York, Mr. Lawler. Mr. Lawler. Thank you, Chairman D'Esposito. Thank you to all of our witnesses for being here today and sharing your knowledge and expertise on this issue. I'd like to start by echoing the sentiments of my colleagues that we certainly appreciate what OSHA is trying to do to improve safety conditions Nation-wide for all of our fire service. I think certainly in a State like New York, where we have a large number of career firefighters, including in New York City, many of whom are constituents of mine, and a large volunteer base, safety is paramount. We want to make sure that all of our firefighters, both from a health standpoint and from the ability to effectively do their job, have the resources and support that they need. The district that I represent, just north of New York City, as I said, is home to certainly a very large community of active and retired FDNY, but it is also a district where almost all of my fire departments are volunteer. So I have met with them on numerous occasions now, and I know there is great concern about some of the provisions that are being proposed for a number of reasons, not the least of which is timing and making sure that there's enough time to review, to digest, to come back with information for OSHA during the comment period. It's why, along with Chairman D'Esposito, we fought to get an extension for an additional 45 days and fought again to get another extension, which was just granted, for an additional 30 days. In your estimation, is that sufficient or should more time be granted to review this? You can each answer. Mr. Walker. So in the State of Maryland, when this proposed rulemaking came out, our State MOSH office, or our State MOSHA office, actually put together a broad team of stakeholders, brought together our Maryland State Firemen's Association, the Maryland State Fire Chiefs, the Metro Chiefs, as well as the IAFF, to go line by line through this proposal and review every single thing that's in there. We're finalizing our document on what we're going to send. But, quite frankly, Maryland took a proactive stance, and each State is required to meet this standard. I can't speak for other States and how they handle business on something like this. But another 30 days will give, I think, every stakeholder enough time to go through this process. I mean, people made time for this because it's important. Mr. Lawler. Mr. Denniston, has New York taken the same proactive approach as Maryland? Mr. Denniston. We started back in December trying to get the information out and disseminate that amongst the fire service agencies. It took a while for the traction to be gained, but we've started the process now. We're holding informational meetings across the State. We're getting concerns. We were in your district just last week---- Mr. Lawler. Yep. Mr. Denniston . Sharing some of those same messages. But, again, it still amazed me the number of people in the room that were completely unaware of what was going on at this point in time. So we certainly feel like some more time is needed. We're not just trying to kick this can down the road. We're just trying to make sure that everybody has a voice as this moves forward. Mr. Lawler. Yes or no, just because we're running short on time, do you all believe there should be an in-person hearing, certainly a virtual one, but an in-person hearing hosted by OSHA so that they can engage on this with stakeholders? Mr. Denniston. We certainly feel that there should. One of the problems that we're having at this point is we've got questions trying to understand some of what's in the document, and OSHA at this point is not willing to answer any questions. So we are making statements on things that we don't have true answers. We feel that in-person hearing would give us the opportunity for some dialog so that we can get some of these things worked out. Mr. Lawler. Yes or no, Mr. Maruca? Mr. Maruca. Yes, it would be useful. Mr. Lawler. Mr. Davis. Mr. Davis. We would actively look forward to defending our members' safety. Mr. Lawler. Mr. Walker. Mr. Walker. I echo the sentiments of the panel. Mr. Lawler. OK. Chief Maruca, the National Volunteer Fire Council did have two seats on the panel as this rule was being written, but do you feel that the volunteer fire service was properly represented in this process and concerns taken into account? Mr. Maruca. We participated in the process. I think we were surprised at the scope and the scale of what was proposed relative to the process up to that point and its impact on the small community departments. Particularly, that half of the fire departments in the United States are in these towns of fewer than 2,500 people. It's an overwhelming burden that's going to fall onto departments that have no budgets and no administrative staff at all. Mr. Lawler. Yes. I think many of the standards that are reflected in OSHA certainly have previously been adopted by a State like New York, which certainly has been proactive in being in favor of safety. But I think it's important that we make sure that we get this right and that the input of all the stakeholders is taken into account. So I certainly would hope that OSHA will hold an in-person hearing and ensure that all the feedback is made available to everyone so that we can get it right going forward. But I also think, from a New York standpoint, we should be very proactive, as Maryland has been, to make sure there's a coordinated response. I yield back. Mr. D'Esposito. The gentleman's time has expired. I now recognize my good friend from New York, Mr. Molinaro. Mr. Molinaro. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and certainly thanks for allowing us to waive on to your committee. This OSHA standard, of course, could provide real benefit to career departments and the need of career departments to meet those standards. Certainly, I'm hopeful that we can find ways to support that effort. As a member of a local volunteer fire company myself, and have been since 1994, as you have, Mr. Chairman, I join thousands upon thousands of New York volunteer firefighters and their families in suggesting--and, by the way, the local governments that support them--in suggesting that these standards just are not attainable by local volunteer fire departments and the support of municipalities. I recognize that you've had a series of questions today. Mr. Denniston, I'm glad you're with us--full disclosure, Mr. Denniston is a constituent--and grateful for your service. New York has over 100,000 volunteer firefighters. We like to say that that likely results in about a $4 billion savings to local property taxpayers. New York State, having the highest burden of property taxes of any people in the country, knows that in order to transition from volunteer to career is a big challenge, and we've seen multiple departments engage in that. The standard here would be such--the standards that, as suggested, would be such a financial burden that property taxes could rise by 27 percent on average State-wide. This could be 50, 60, 70 percent in small communities of 500 and 600 and 700 residents who support volunteer fire companies. Rather than getting far afield, I'll focus here. Mr. Denniston, does the State of New York have enough training capacity to get volunteer firefighters up to the training standards as suggested by OSHA? Mr. Denniston. With the standards the way they're currently written, one of the proposed NFPA standards that's incorporated by reference would require us to have Fire Officer I for our captains and lieutenants, Fire Officer II for our assistant chiefs, Fire Officer III for our chief officers. We do not have the capacity currently in New York State to offer Fire Officer III. Office of Fire Prevention and Control is working on that now so that we can get that put together, but they're estimating between 5 and 7 years to get the corps stood up, to get the instructors trained, and to make it available to reach the masses that we would have to reach. Unfortunately, with the way that this has been proposed by OSHA, they're looking at a 2-year time line for us to have that done. So they're looking for it in 2 years and it's going to take us 5 to 7 years to incorporate that. So we would like to get to that point, but we're just not there yet. Mr. Molinaro. So, Mr. Denniston, you come from a part of the State that, obviously, I represent. Truly upstate, Mr. Chairman, by definition. Do our communities have the medical staff, physicians, to meet the physical examination requirements as proposed? Mr. Denniston. So the 1582 standard that's been incorporated by reference, we're being told by our providers that they do not have the capacity to do that, to meet that standard. Again, we're all for firefighter physicals. We think that there should be screenings. We think there should be a lot of things. But the 1582 standard is just so detailed in what it requires that our providers are telling us they do not have that capacity to meet right at this point. Mr. Molinaro. Mr. Denniston, how many--you deal with a number of volunteer fire departments. Do any of them get direct revenue from the Federal Government? Mr. Denniston. Most of our fire departments are all taxpayered, other than the grant programs which have been cut. Mr. Molinaro. Do any of our local volunteer fire departments get direct financial assistance from the State of New York? No competitive grant, just a check thanking you for your service? Mr. Denniston. No, sir. It's all the local taxpayers. Mr. Molinaro. OK. So all of this, of course, lands on local property taxpayers. This is not to suggest that we shouldn't have the highest standards; in fact, I think volunteer firefighters try to meet those standards. Certainly, as a former county executive, I can assert that in the State of New York especially county governments through the departments of emergency management are required to establish training platforms and to engage in mutual aid planning and prop up an emergency response system when local communities can't shoulder that entire burden. Mr. Davis, I have the greatest respect for the career firefighters, have a great number in my district that I work with. There is little question that these standards could provide great value to career departments, and we ought to meet the highest standard. I agree with that. Do you think, though, right now agencies--would they or would they not, once--if this standard were to go into effect, don't you think volunteer and career would turn to AFG and SAFER grants unlike ever before in order to access dollars to meet these standards? Would you suggest that that's probably true? Mr. Davis. Sure. I mean, I think there's a logical assumption that departments will look for those grant opportunities. But I think there's also a likelihood it's going to drive discussions in the local government itself, as well as the State government, for ways we can find, ways to meet these requirements. I think certainly in places where there are high property tax levels could see difficulty in raising taxes. But, again, those discussions need to be had. Just because it's costly doesn't mean we need to shy away from safety. Mr. Molinaro. Without--my concern with the Chairman--I won't further the questions, only to assert that that is very-- that's a very thoughtful response. I think we all acknowledge, in the State of New York in particular, there are 5 separate ways you can create a fire department. None of them make any sense. It's a municipal department. It's a district. It could be contract, it could be 501(c)(3), or it could be municipally-owned. You and I all know that to bridge that particular conversation won't take more than 7 years, it'll take 700 years to have that kind of conversation. The State of New York has never--has never--put dollars on the ground effectively to support volunteer fire departments. I think we all agree that we want Federal dollars to get to the men and women on the front line, whether they be career or volunteers. So I do hope, Mr. Chairman, that OSHA commits to another hearing. I hope that we can consider standards that get our volunteers to the highest degree practical, but acknowledge the reality that we live in. We don't have the resources. The taxpayers are already overburdened. Municipalities don't have the technical strength to engage in this. Oh, by the way, thanks to New York being the leader in outward migration--more people leave the State of New York to other States in this country--we don't even have the human beings to engage in the kind of effort that it would take to make that sort of transition. But I respect you all. I appreciate you all. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you, Mr. Molinaro. With that, I want to thank all the witnesses for being here. I just want to, last, say a couple of comments after this hearing. I think that this was an opportunity for us to further conversation. I want to thank the International Association of Fire Fighters. Like was mentioned, this OSHA standard hasn't been touched since 1980, and you have been the driving force of making firefighters' lives safer throughout this country. It's not just career firefighters but volunteers and everybody in between. So I want to thank you for that. I also want to thank those that have served the volunteer fire service for much of their lives for the same thing, for being here on Capitol Hill today and traveling from different parts of the country in order to speak on behalf of firefighters throughout the Nation, people who work their regular jobs and get out of their beds and leave their dinner tables to respond to alarms because they love their community. This is an opportunity that we have here that probably--I know it sounds cliche--but they haven't been changed since 1980. It's probably a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to change a standard, to make things safer, to make apparatus safer, to make sure that firefighters have the resources they need to do their jobs. I want to thank you all for being here, for speaking out and being passionate about the things that matter most. I really, truly hope that, as you could see here today, we had individuals waive onto this committee from different parts of the country, because it matters to everyone. This isn't a Republican or a Democrat issue; I think it's an American public safety issue and one that we take very seriously. So I hope that this is the start of many more conversations not only with just the stakeholders in this room but with OSHA and others to make sure that everyone is represented and that everyone is kept safe, because at the end of the day that is exactly what we are here to do and what we're here for. So the Members of the subcommittee may have some additional questions for witnesses, and I would ask that the witnesses respond to those in writing. Pursuant to Committee Rule VII(D), the hearing record will be open for 10 days. Without objection, this subcommittee stands adjourned. I ask you all to please remain safe.
