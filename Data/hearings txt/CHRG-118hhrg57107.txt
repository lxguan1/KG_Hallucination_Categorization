LOOKING BEYOND 2025 FOR TRADE WITH SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, HAITI, AND OTHERS ---------- WEDNESDAY, JUNE 12, 2024 House of Representatives, Subcommittee on Trade, Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC. The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 1:15 p.m., in Room 1100, Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Adrian Smith  presiding. Chairman SMITH. The subcommittee will come to order. Thank you, Ranking Member Blumenauer, subcommittee members, and certainly our witnesses here today. Today's hearing is an important opportunity to discuss the set of trade preferences programs scheduled to expire in 2025, including the African Growth and Opportunity Act, AGOA, and U.S. Trade Preference Programs for Haiti and the Nepal Trade Preference Program. These programs are designed to foster economic growth in some of the least developed countries and economies in the world while strengthening U.S. leadership and influence abroad. This is especially important as countries like China and Russia seek to spread their malign influence globally. In April, this committee took an important first step by passing the Generalized System of Preferences Reform Act, GSP, which would provide the most significant reform of the GSP Program since it began. Last month I introduced legislation with the support of 20 committee Republicans to reauthorize the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Process as well. Now we must build on this effort by considering reform and renewal of our Trade Preference Programs set to expire in 2025. Since its inception in 2000, the AGOA Program has been the cornerstone of U.S. trade and economic engagement with sub- Saharan Africa. The program has two important elements--one, duty-free access to the U.S. market, and two, eligibility criteria to ensure beneficiary countries meet U.S. standards in key areas like human rights, governance, rule of law, and fair treatment for foreign companies and exporters. These elements are designed to support sub-Saharan African economies, develop trade capacity, and strengthen U.S. relationships with beneficiary countries. Today's hearing is a continuation of a deliberate Ways and Means Committee process regarding AGOA renewal, which has included roundtables, member visits to AGOA countries, and now a public hearing. I encourage all interested stakeholders to participate in this hearing through submissions for the record. A few key areas we should address through AGOA renewal include: One, pursuing reciprocal market access for American farmers, workers, and businesses in sub-Saharan Africa; Two, addressing the process of graduation from AGOA when a country surpasses the per capita income threshold; And three, transforming AGOA to encourage more value-added manufacturing on the African continent while ensuring third countries are not receiving disproportionate benefits. But first we must ensure that participation in AGOA supports the development of science- and rules-based standards in beneficiary countries and use the annual review process to address any unfair treatment of U.S. ag products. All AGOA countries must provide fair market access to U.S. producers and manufacturers. In the case of countries that are prepared for that next step, we must pursue robust conversations to move such an agreement forward. I once again call on the Biden administration to develop a coherent, effective strategy for pursuing comprehensive trade agreements and seeking congressional approval of such agreements. It is well past time--well past time--to resume negotiations of a comprehensive, enforceable trade agreement with Kenya, for example. My colleagues on both sides of the aisle agree on this. Kenya wants to step up and move on from a temporary unilateral preference program to a reciprocal, mutually beneficial relationship, and the only thing standing in the way is this current administration. When countries have reached the income level to graduate from the program, I hope we can consider commonsense reforms to ensure they are not punished for success in economic development. Congress should consider creative solutions to prevent a graduation cliff and secure market access for our exporters. In each of these areas, improving access to African markets will support American workers, businesses, and farmers with little downside since AGOA already provides generous access to the U.S. market. I am eager to hear more about how Congress can encourage more value-added manufacturing on the African continent. African cotton should not be sent halfway across the globe to be made into fabric just to be sent back to Africa for final manufacturing. The people of Africa should be the beneficiaries of AGOA. Next I will turn to our Haiti Trade Preference Programs. They were created by Congress through the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement and the Haiti Economic Lift Program Act. These programs provide important benefits to imports of textiles and apparel products from Haiti. The apparel industry supports thousands of jobs for the Haitian people, providing important economic stability in this time of uncertainty and unrest. I appreciate the leadership of Representative Wenstrup on this and look forward to working with him regarding next steps on the program. Also, the Nepal Trade Preference Program, which was established in 2015, to help Nepal recover from devastating earthquakes is set to expire next year. I look forward to working with my colleagues and stakeholders on next steps for the program. I now recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Blumenauer, for his opening statement. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In the course of the hearing and the opening statements, you will see there are a number of areas of agreement. The African Growth and Opportunity Act, also known as AGOA, and the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership and Encouragement Act, known as HOPE, are the cornerstone of U.S. trade policy with sub-Saharan Africa and Haiti. The world, however, looks a lot different than it did when we enacted these programs decades ago. We now have years of experience to help understand what is working and what could be improved to raise living standards and bring more trade and investment both to Africa and the Caribbean. This hearing is the next step in the committee's ongoing review of American preference programs for sub-Saharan Africa and Haiti, and there is clear, bipartisan consensus on promoting trade and investment with Africa and the Caribbean. Then Chairman Neal set a strong tone for reviewing and improving these programs last Congress. This Congress, Chairman Jason Smith and Trade Subcommittee chair, Mr. Adrian Smith, have continued the committee's engagement, and this hearing today is an example of that. Their leadership is buttressed by several of my colleagues who have demonstrated continued commitment to Africa and Haiti. Chairman Smith mentioned some of his Republican colleagues. I would be remiss in not acknowledging Ms. Sewell, Ms. Moore, Mr. Evans, and Ms. Plaskett. And by the way, we wish continued recovery for Mr. Evans from his recent health problems. House Democrats have collectively shown an impenetrable commitment to the people of sub-Saharan Africa and Haiti and will pursue the U.S. trade policies that advance prosperity for the people of these regions. I can speak confidently for House Democrats when I say we are firmly committed to reauthorization of AGOA and HOPE before their expiration next year. But reauthorizing the programs without improving them is a missed opportunity. The International Trade Commission's report on these programs demonstrated the urgent need for reform. It is important that our trade policies not only address long-term standing concerns, such as the low utilization rates in AGOA and labor violations in Haiti, which we have had some direct experience with, but also reflect the realities of today and pave the way for the future that we want to see. AGOA is a success story. It has opened new opportunities for economic engagement and has resulted in tens of thousands of jobs in sub-Saharan Africa. It is critical Congress drives more investment to the continent, which creates opportunities for business both in Africa and the United States, as well as for the larger diaspora. But as proud as we are of AGOA's achievements, it has not achieved all that we had hoped. As we consider the future of AGOA, we need to find creative ways to improve AGOA's utilization rate, increase value-added exports to the United States, and ensure that the benefits, in fact, flow to the African beneficiary countries. Africa has become a leader in addressing climate change. It is the site of key critical minerals and is quickly becoming a tech and innovation powerhouse. The creative sector, including TV, film, and music, are essential to the economies of the continent. Our American trade policy must reflect these developments and make the most of these opportunities. Our trade policy should recognize that certain African economies are more advanced and better integrated globally since AGOA was enacted, making it important to both consider AGOA graduation rules, and developing mutually beneficial and reciprocal trade agreements with other sub-Saharan African countries. Like sub-Saharan Africa, the United States has a moral obligation to remain committed to the Haitian people. That obligation is now more important than ever. Haiti played a central role in the American Revolutionary War, as we are coming up to that 250th anniversary, where hundreds of Haitians fought for American independence, a feature that is little known in this country. And years later, Haiti would defeat the French, become the first Black republic, influencing the rise of abolitionist and anti-colonial movements all over the world, including the United States. But the record of the United States dealing with that revolution is shameful, and we are still paying the price--more importantly, the Haitian people are paying the price today. Many of Haiti's difficulties are because of a failure of American policy. That is why our preference programs for Haiti are so important. They provide an opportunity to help strengthen Haiti's economy and our trading relationship and remediate past wrongs. But we must acknowledge known problems with implementation of our preference programs, especially concerning labor rights violations and noncompliance with Haiti's national labor laws. The United States has selectively engaged in this space on issues like forced labor in the sugar sector, but there is much more to do. Like any trading relationship, our relationship with Haiti requires work on both sides--work to improve labor conditions, political stability, and diversify Haiti's export to the United States. Mr. Chairman, I am convinced that today's hearing today is a step in that direction in this important work, and I appreciate you convening this and look forward to hearing from our witnesses. Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Blumenauer. I appreciate your input there. I now recognize the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Smith, for his opening statement. Chairman SMITH of Missouri. Thank you, Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Blumenauer, for holding today's hearing. As the committee continues to examine how best to reauthorize the African Growth and Opportunity Act program, as well as strengthen other trade relationships with other nations, while we have time to address the reauthorization of AGOA before its September 2025 expiration, there is no sense in waiting. And so I appreciate the trade subcommittee keeping the drumbeat going. This hearing follows two bipartisan roundtables we held earlier this year one with ambassadors from several of the sub-Saharan Africa countries that participate in AGOA, and another with stakeholders that utilize AGOA in order to hear firsthand their perspectives on the program. The AGOA program has a successful track record of encouraging economic development in sub-Saharan Africa and greater access for U.S. agriculture products in that region. Something I have watched closely over the years, having attended an AGOA forum in Gabon back in 2015, under the program, American taxpayers have invested over $8 billion in trade-related activities in Africa over the past 20-plus years. Reauthorizing AGOA will ensure that American taxpayers get a positive return on their investment. It will also strengthen our economic relationship by making sure access to African markets for American exports, especially agriculture, is fair, and our trade relationships benefit American workers, farmers, and businesses. We also need to use our trade tools to counter the malign influence of countries like China and Russia. The AGOA program can play an important role in shoring up our critical supply chains to reduce our dependence on China. Earlier this year, the Ways and Means Committee approved trade reforms to counter China's growing military and economic influence around the world. This included the Generalized System of Preference Reform Act, introduced by Trade Subcommittee Chairman Smith, that would ban China from the GSP program and incentivize countries to grow their economies in partnership with the United States, not China. Those same reforms should be reflected in a reauthorization of AGOA. Meanwhile, our trade relationship with Haiti supports American manufacturing while encouraging stability in a nation that is currently suffering tremendous political and social turmoil. I have serious concerns with the violence that is taking place in Haiti, violence that recently took the lives of two individuals from my home state of Missouri who were in the country doing missionary work when they were killed by armed gang members. I want to thank Dr. Wenstrup in particular for his leadership on this issue, as well as a number of other members of this committee on both sides of the aisle. I appreciate their recognition that U.S. businesses can be a force for good, particularly for a nation like Haiti, which is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. Thank you again, Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Blumenauer, and to all of our witnesses for being here today. Chairman SMITH. Thank you. I now have the pleasure of introducing our witnesses for today's hearing. Skip Richmond is the founder and co-CEO of DTRT Apparel Group. Next we have Daniel Runde. He is the senior vice president and Schreyer Chair in Global Analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. And I will yield to Dr. Wenstrup to introduce our next witness. Mr. WENSTRUP. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I am pleased to introduce Mr. Af Nasser, vice president of Sourcing Center of Excellence and Supplier Diversity at Cintas Corporation, a proud Ohio company, headquartered in the Cincinnati area. It has been a pleasure to watch Cintas grow through my lifetime. Cintas does great work across the United States every day, ensuring that millions of employees can go to work and perform their best by providing uniforms, supplies, first aid and safety products two things very important to me as a physician. Cintas is uniquely positioned to provide a key perspective in our discussion today, as their global supply chain runs through both sub-Saharan Africa and Haiti. As many of my colleagues here know, I have been a supportive leader on Haiti trade issues over the last few years, and I credit Cintas Corporation with bringing this critical issue to my attention as early as 2019, when they shared with me their support for renewing the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act. Working with Representative Terri Sewell, we got that bill done in 2020, and I am looking forward to doing the same with the HOPE/HELP preferences that are up for renewal right now. With that, Mr. Nasser, I want to welcome you and thank you for being here today. Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Dr. Wenstrup. And we also have Marggie Peters Muhika. She is the deputy regional director of Africa with the Solidarity Center. Again, thank you to all of our witnesses. I do want to say that your written statement will be made part of the record, and you each will have five minutes to deliver your remarks. Once that yellow light appears, if you wouldn't mind bringing the flight in for a landing, do what you can to stick within the five minutes. So with that, Mr. Richmond, you are recognized. STATEMENT OF SKIP RICHMOND, FOUNDER AND CO-CEO, DTRT APPAREL GROUP Mr. RICHMOND. Thank you. I would like to thank you for the opportunity to share our story and engage in this important conversation. My name is Skip Richmond. I was born and raised in the U.S., and I am the founder and co-CEO of DTRT Apparel Group, the largest apparel manufacturing company in West Africa. DTRT owns two factories in Ghana where we produce knitwear-- primarily T-shirts, polos, and hoodies--and other sportswear for large clothing brands in the U.S. and EU. We currently employ over 5,600 workers in Ghana, making over 50,000 garments per day. I would like to give you a brief background of how our business got started and what we have accomplished so far. I will also share with you some of the very exciting things we see ahead for our industry, and the African continent in general, that are dependent on a swift and timely, long-term renewal of AGOA. First, how we got started, my cofounder, Marc Hansult, and I first met in 2004 when we both went to work for a Hong Kong- based trading company. In 2005, we needed to find a factory outside China to produce some basketball uniforms. We learned about AGOA at that time, and we traveled to Madagascar looking for a factory to produce goods for us. At the conclusion of that visit, the decision was made for the company to establish our own factory in Madagascar. Unfortunately, Madagascar experienced a coup a few years later in 2009 and lost its access to AGOA benefits as a result. That experience reinforced for us the importance of finding a stable democratic home for our future work. In 2013, Marc and I cofounded DTRT Apparel. DTRT stands for ``Do the right thing.'' With two young children of my own at the time, I wanted to show my kids that it was possible to do good in the world and still make a good living. Although our industry has a bad reputation, justifiably in many cases, I don't know of any industry that holds so much power to do good in this world. What other industry can employ so many people, so quickly, from a socioeconomic population with such limited opportunity? Marc and I have always felt that a garment-manufacturing business can make a healthy profit, while treating our people and the planet with respect. We set out to harness the power of our industry to provide our local workers and their children a better future and to hopefully set an example for others in our industry. We chose Ghana as DTRT's home for several reasons--first its geography. From our experience in East Africa, we encountered transit times of 50 to 60 days or longer to get finished goods from the factory to the U.S. That very long lead time limited the customers we could service. To provide the shortest possible lead time to customers and expand our market, we were specifically interested in looking at a country in West Africa to minimize that time. Second, but just as important, Ghana is arguably the most stable democracy on the continent, having achieved multiple consecutive peaceful transitions of power over the past three decades. After our experience with the coup in Madagascar, establishing operations in a stable democracy was very important to us. Another critically important factor in our decision to operate in Ghana was the fact that it was possible for us to pay wages high enough that the jobs we provide can truly lift our local workers and their families out of poverty. Contrary to many places around the world that trap workers in poverty with their very low wages, we are having an enormous positive impact on the lives of our local workers and their families in Ghana. This year, 2024, marks the 10-year anniversary of our first garment exports from Ghana to the U.S. As mentioned earlier, we currently employ over 5,600 people, 76 percent of whom are women. Almost 50 percent of our supervisors and managers are women, and that number is increasing every month. There isn't a pool of experienced workers in Ghana like exists in Asia. We train every new worker, and the training cost is significant. It typically takes 6 months for a new worker to become efficient enough for us to break even. Without the benefits of AGOA, we wouldn't be able to afford to train so many people. Renewing AGOA now is critical to maintain the momentum we are currently seeing. When we started our business 10 years ago, it was very difficult to get the attention from major brands to bring their business to West Africa. But today there has never been more interest in sourcing from African manufacturers. The COVID pandemic highlighted how overdependent many companies remain on Chinese suppliers. Human rights issues and other geopolitical forces are forcing brands to seek alternatives to Asian suppliers like never before. Unlike years ago when barely any brands had Africa on their radar, today every major U.S. brand to whom we speak is exploring ways to source from Africa. Despite the many advantages that sourcing from AGOA- eligible countries offer, African manufacturers can currently only fulfill a small fraction of what these U.S. brands need. Africa must clear two key hurdles to be competitive with established global players in the long run--developing human capacity through training of skilled garment workers and building regional value chains to supply fabrics and accessories. That training is happened already at DTRT and others in the region via on-the-job instruction from experienced ex-pats, but we can only afford to train because of the benefits from AGOA. The lack of existing input supply is where AGOA remains most essential. While a Chinese manufacturer can buy all their raw material inputs domestically, we must input nearly--or import nearly 100 percent of raw materials from overseas. Some of that investment is already happening, but uncertainty over when and for how long AGOA will be renewed, limits and delays needed investment. The ROI in investment in our industry is at least 7 years. Renewal of AGOA within this year for a minimum of 10 to 20 years, would provide the sort of comfort that companies require before investing to maximize AGOA's impact. We would also like to highlight the continued importance of the Third Country Fabric Provision in any AGOA renewal. There are hundreds of different fabrics that will ultimately need to be produced in Africa for the continent to no longer be reliant on imported textiles. It will likely take decades for the necessary fabric mills to reach a scale where the continent will be self-sufficient. As such, the Third Country Fabric Provision would remain an essential clause in AGOA for at least the full term of any renewal. We started DTRT in 2014, when we knew AGOA was up for renewal just 1 year later, based on nothing more than faith that Congress would do the right thing and extend this important policy. We borrowed money from our friends and families, and we spent many years worrying about how we would make payroll at the end of the month. We expect to continue our rapid growth in the years to come. We believe we have played a key role in establishing West Africa as a viable manufacturing source for American apparel companies at a moment when for the first time ever, the entire industry is seeking alternatives to China. Congress can send a strong message to ensure AGOA fulfills its promise by renewing AGOA swiftly for another term. As I tell my own team regularly, don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Yes, AGOA can be improved, but delaying its renewal risks doing more harm to the momentum we are seeing than the potential good that added refinements might offer. I implore you as a citizen, taxpayer, and entrepreneur, to find a way to renew AGOA quickly, and if needed as-is, with the ability to refine it in the future if necessary. Please don't let the debate on improvements to AGOA be endless, and please remember that each passing day without renewal means delaying and possibly losing forever a significant amount of business for the continent of Africa to other parts of the world. Thank you very much.   Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Richmond. Mr. Runde, you are recognized. STATEMENT OF DANIEL RUNDE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND SCHREYER CHAIR IN GLOBAL ANALYSIS, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES Mr. RUNDE. Thank you. Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Blumenauer, and members of the subcommittee, thank you. There are three basic options for AGOA which include no AGOA renewal, a copy-paste renewal of the 2015 legislation, or three, enhancing AGOA with a series of modernizations. I have two bottom lines. First, I am in favor of renewing AGOA with some updates to the legislation. Second--and this is very important--failure to renew AGOA would be a strategic disaster for the United States. Champagne corks will pop in Beijing over our failure to renew AGOA. Our African partners will be enormously disappointed with us, and failure to pass AGOA means that American business will be disadvantaged in Africa. AGOA is the unilateral trade agreement that provides duty- free access to the U.S. market. You all are aware of that. Like the rest of the world, Africa today is a different place than the Africa of 2000. Africa is a freer place than in, say, 1990. Africa's middle class has tripled to over 350 million people. There are more smartphones in Africa than in the United States of America. The creation of the African Continental Free Trade Area, one of the largest free trade areas in the world, is a game- changer. Linked with AGOA, AFCTA will encourage greater U.S. commercial investment in the African region because U.S. companies will be able to tap into suppliers across the continent. China's agreement with African countries has dramatically increased in the past decade. Fifty-two of the 54 African countries have signed on to Belt and Road. China has invested at least 2.5 times as much in African infrastructure as the entire Western world. The Chinese have ownership of 23 ports--or control of 23 ports in Africa. China is consolidating global influence over mining, including in Africa. Today, Huawei owns up to 70 percent of all 4G networks in sub-Saharan Africa. U.S. trade with African states is one-fifth the size of China-African trade. AGOA is part of our offer to Africa to counter China. So I have got several recommendations. First, renew AGOA, please, and make some improvements. There are some special considerations for the digital space and for minerals. Although there are no barriers to African digital trade exports to the United States, Congress has an opportunity to recognize the growing importance of digital trade. Language can be included in AGOA's reauthorization to develop a partnership, a digital partnership, with Africa that builds on emerging international standards and reduces barriers to digital trade in African countries. Right now there are no countries in Africa currently making electric vehicles or electric batteries, and there are no tariffs on basic raw materials and minerals, so--however, now would be the time for us to ramp up our partnership with African countries through the Minerals Strategic Partnership. Regardless of whether or not Congress determines if AGOA eligibility is the equivalent of an FTA for the purposes of the Inflation Reduction Act, the U.S. should launch a comprehensive development and development finance initiative along the lines of Power Africa for mining and minerals in Africa. Number 3, fix graduation eligibility. Renewals should fix graduation criteria so that countries that benefit from AGOA are not punished for their success by being graduated out of the program. Becoming a middle-income country like Mauritius means that these countries graduate from AGOA, and these countries lose their AGOA benefits. Four, we should create bilateral, free trade agreements on the African continent. We should think about regional free trade agreements along the lines of the CAFTA-DR agreement in Latin America for West, East, and Southern Africa. Fifth, we should adjust the timelines. Let's aim for at least a 10-year or even a 16-year renewal. Six, let's use foreign aid to support AGOA. In the next Congress, I hope we will develop a major foreign assistance initiative for mining and minerals. I hope we will develop a major foreign assistance initiative to close the digital divide. And three, I hope we develop a major foreign assistance and partnership initiative to create 20 to 30 private universities in Africa as we did in India and Costa Rica in the 1960s. Seven, the executive branch needs more than a binary on-off switch for AGOA. I know that South Africa is on your minds. And AGOA is a trade mechanism. It is not a political mechanism. When the United States experiences tensions or disagreements with certain African countries, it is tempting to treat AGOA as a stick. South Africa has been a particularly poor partner on a number of fronts, so I understand the temptation. We should instead employ a variety of political tools. The Coons Rish draft legislation would provide a larger menu of enforcement options, including formal warnings, probationary periods, and partial termination of benefits for certain products. Finally, beyond AGOA, we need a 21st century partnership for AGOA--for Africa, a 21st century partnership for Africa. We first need to pass AGOA, and then we need to come to a bipartisan consensus on a strategy for a 21st century U.S.- Africa partnership, a strategy spanning trade deals, investment, capacity-building, and integration of new digital realities. Thank you.   Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Runde. Now I recognize Mr. Nasser. Please begin. STATEMENT OF AF NASSER, VICE PRESIDENT OF SOURCING & COE, CINTAS CORPORATION Mr. NASSER. Good afternoon, Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Blumenauer, and members of the subcommittee. Thank you for holding this hearing and the opportunity to testify on the importance of these trade preference programs. My name is Af Nasser, and I am the vice president of Sourcing Center of Excellence and Supplier Diversity for the Cintas Corporation. Cintas helps more than 1 million businesses of all types and sizes get ready to open their doors with confidence by providing a wide range of products including uniforms, mats, mops, restroom supplies, first aid and safety products, fire- extinguishers and testing, and safety training. Cintas' operations touch almost every corner of the United States, and our employee partners are a driving force behind our shared accomplishments. Cintas employs approximately 45,000 individuals in our workforce today. Before discussing our international supply chain, I would like to spend a moment highlighting our diverse supply chain here in the United States. In fiscal year 2024, Cintas spent more than $320 million with certified diverse suppliers which we define as a company that is headquartered in the United States or its Territories, and is owned, operated, and controlled by a U.S. citizen who is a minority, woman, or veteran. On a daily basis, I work closely with our global suppliers to ensure they conduct business in the same ethical and moral standard that we do as a company. Each and every supplier must comply with a vendor code of conduct as a condition of doing business with Cintas. In addition to sourcing from more than 23 countries, Cintas operates four manufacturing facilities that provide for standard uniform needs. Currently, we procure goods and products from a global network of international vendors, including Haiti, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Madagascar, which are being discussed here today. Renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act, and the Haiti Economic Lift Program Act, in advance of next year's expiration is critical to the continued success of Cintas. We strongly support the committee's efforts to reauthorize these trade preference programs and reduce trade barriers wherever possible. As we look to diversify our supply chain and minimize imports from China, Cintas's ongoing investment in Africa is critical. For this to be successful, preferences which enable us to source from markets on the continent are essential. I would like to spend a few moments highlighting a couple of countries starting with my mother's home country of Kenya. Kenya is a small but important supplier of apparel to the U.S. market and to Cintas. In 2023, U.S. apparel imports from Kenya were $488 million, accounting for just over half of 1 percent of total apparel imports. Cintas' apparel imports from Kenya accounted for approximately 5 percent of our total imports. Long-term renewal of AGOA would provide increased certainty for production, and as a result, potentially open increased opportunities in Kenya. Regardless of the legislative vehicle, we urge the committee to take a close look at the rules of origin to ensure they remain intact, or ideally enhanced, so that Kenya's apparel industry can not only remain competitive but also expands. I would also like to thank the committee, and specifically Congressman Wenstrup, and many others on this dais today for their work around the reauthorization of HOPE/HELP Act. Renewal of these programs will provide economic hope to Haiti as it struggles through its current political and security challenges. Haiti is an integral part of our Western Hemispheric supply chain. We first began producing in Haiti in 2002 and have greatly expanded our manufacturing footprint there over the last 20 years. Today, we indirectly employ approximately 4,000 Haitians through our dedicated supplier relationships. Our suppliers' large and dedicated labor pool also set the industry standard. For example, our primary Haitian supplier operates in clean and safe environments. A nutritious lunch and chilled water are available to all the employees. Once a week, a licensed physician from Port-au-Prince visits the plants to address any health concerns that employees may have. Even with these worker benefits, our Haitian supplier remains the most highly productive and cost-competitive source that we have globally. Currently, a significant portion of apparel production originates on Haitian soil. Unfortunately, the latest security challenges and arrests in the country have significantly hindered our ability to ship to the United States. We are cautiously optimistic that Kenya's commitment to insist the Haitians will be instrumental in allowing a return to normalcy for its citizens, the Port-au-Prince region, and the country. In closing, reauthorization of these critical trade preference programs will help reinforce the United States' commitment to develop in Africa, Haiti, and beyond. Thank you again to the committee for the opportunity to testify, and I look forward to any questions you have at the appropriate time.   Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Nasser. Ms. Muhika, you are recognized. STATEMENT OF MARGGIE PETERS MUHIKA, DEPUTY REGIONAL DIRECTOR OF AFRICA, SOLIDARITY CENTER Ms. MUHIKA. Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Blumenauer, and distinguished members of the committee Ways and Means, Subcommittee on Trade. Thank you for holding this hearing and for the opportunity to testify. I represent the Solidarity Center, the largest U.S.-based international worker rights organization, with programs in approximately 70 countries, including 20 African countries and Haiti. We partner with unions and the other labor organizations to help workers attain dignity on the job, justice in their communities, and greater equity in the global economy. Today I will highlight working conditions in Africa and Haiti, including examples of what unions are doing to promote worker rights in Kenya and Lesotho. I will then conclude with recommendations. The need to safeguard labor rights in Africa has never been greater. Africa has the fastest growing, youngest population of any continent and will be home to a quarter of the world's workforce by 2050. Annually between 8 million and 11 million young people enter the African labor market without a guarantee that they will find work, let alone decent jobs. The labor market in Africa is characterized by a wide income disparity between a small number of formal public and private employees and a vast informal economy. In Africa, 87 percent of the workforce is informal. Jobs in the informal economy have the potential to provide productive economic activity for a growing demographic, but the sector remains highly unregulated with insufficient legal protections for informal economy workers and notable violations of their rights. In Kenya, three trade unions representing Kenya's formal sector workers in food, health, education, and metals, signed MOUs with the formal worker associations in their respective sectors. This means that Kenya's trade unions have brought informal sector workers under the union umbrella. For the first time, this gives them access to legal frameworks that protects formal workers. According to the International Trade Union Confederation's Global Rights Index, 84 percent of countries in Africa denied workers access to justice; 40 percent arrested and detained workers; 93 percent violated the rights to collective bargaining, while workers in one out of five African countries experienced violence. For example, we lost a prominent human rights lawyer and trade unionist, Thulani Maseko, to violence, a devastating loss for workers across Africa. Despite the challenges facing workers in Africa, we have witnessed some progress. In Lesotho, three leading apparel brands and a major supplier of denim signed binding agreements with a coalition of labor unions and women rights organizations. Together they are addressing and preventing gender-based violence and harassment in garment factories through mandatory education and awareness trainings, and the establishment of an independent reporting and monitoring system with remedies, including termination for abusive behavior. The Solidarity Center is proud to have helped negotiate these agreements and to implement ongoing trainings for thousands of workers and managers. The progress we see in Africa is eclipsed by the turmoil and lawlessness in Haiti where the fragile climate has left garment workers unemployed and leaving in extreme precarity. Existing institutions have limited capacity to hold employers accountable for noncompliance with labor law. This has been a long-standing challenge for Haitian workers, a topic detailed in Solidarity Center's 2020 testimony before this subcommittee, covering consideration for the renewal of the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act. Despite the present insecurity in Haiti, our experience implementing programs tells us that there will be a high risk of labor rights violations after the crisis abates. For that reason, it is critical that the U.S. pursues a worker-centric trade policy that advances sustainable economic development and protects--and promotes labor rights. In Haiti it should mean that regional supply chains produce and rely on decent jobs, and employers and policymakers are held to account when they break the rules. To achieve a worker-centric approach to trade, we have several recommendations: One, trade unions and work organizations must be fully included in all phases of negotiations through the design and implementation of trade policies and initiative; Two, the U.S. must prioritize worker-centered trade policies leveraging trade and trade preference programs to achieve enforcement of labor laws and to compel the establishment of binding mechanisms that meaningfully address rights violations; Three, U.S. development assistance policy should support the role of trade unions in advocating for labor rights in the context of trade, including with USAID missions; And lastly, the U.S. Government should prioritize and promote long-term stability in Haiti as a means to ensure economic recovery, a prerequisite for upholding labor rights. Thank you for the opportunity to share Solidarity Center's perspective. The Solidarity Center remains committed to centering workers and trade policy, and leveraging trade to advance labor rights. We appreciate the work of this subcommittee to uplift the voices of workers and unions worldwide. I look forward to your questions.   Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Ms. Muhika. I now recognize Mr. Buchanan from Florida for his questions. Mr. BUCHANAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank all of our witnesses. It is good timing for us to lead a delegation to Africa next week--or this Friday actually. So we are very excited about that, and these issues will be at the top of the burner, so to speak. I did want to go back, look at the big picture, Mr. Runde. You said that one-fifth is what, in terms of trade that we do, compared to the Chinese, with Africa. $282 billion the Chinese do, by numbers, $84 billion that we do. How do we close the gap? We say we need a new agreement, but we need a new and an improved agreement that helps these folks, a billion of them, in Africa, because obviously I think it is a new frontier, as you can see Mr. Richmond's story, and we really need to up our game. We talk a good game, but we don't deliver, and I--there is a lot of us in there. But don't sugar-coat it. Tell us how you really feel. Mr. RUNDE. Okay. I will try. Thank you. Thank you, Congressman. So I think we have--we have not updated our cassette tape on Africa. Africa suffers from a negative media coverage. There have been studies in ``The New York Times'' and others, it is just all negative. And so we have failed to see Africa as an opportunity. The Chinese Communist Party sees Africa as a win-win opportunity. Unfortunately, much of our partnership with Africa to date has been oriented around foreign assistance. I am all in favor of foreign assistance. I worked at AID, I wrote a book on American soft power, I am all for that. That has got to be one piece of a much bigger conversation. So we need an updated partnership. Getting AGOA passed, if we don't reauthorize, like--I think I made it clear, that not reauthorizing AGOA is a--there will be a party in Moscow, there will be a party in Beijing if we don't reauthorize it. So first we got to do that. I would like to see some updates. Then I think we need to think about a more ambitious trade agenda for Africa. I think it is fantastic that you and Chairman Smith are leading these delegations to Africa. I think it is very, very important. I think we need to see Africa as a win-win partnership. They have other partners today. In the year 2000, when AGOA was started, I don't believe China was the number 1 trading partner for any country in sub-Saharan Africa. Maybe, I don't know if it is 35, I don't know if it is 40--someone can tell me, but it is going to be a lot. Mr. BUCHANAN. Let me--I only got five minutes, so I want to ask, Mr. Richmond, let me ask you, one of the big advantages a lot of the Asian countries have had, is it basically free labor or very low-cost labor? How does that equate in Africa? Is everybody--does that make some sense there, or what happens with the labor component in Africa? Because that is obviously--maybe they are making three times what they made, but you are able to get a lot more competitive, but in a sense, it also hurts indirectly--might hurt the U.S. What are your thoughts? Mr. RICHMOND. The cost of labor and what people are making in China and Asia, you know, it has gone up a lot in recent years. You know, my view on that is that actually the money that we pay and when--and I, you know, I heard the comments the gentleman from Cintas made. I mean, we also have--we are paying--our lowest paid worker is making, you know, like, well more, like double of what the country's minimum wage is. You know, we offer a free catered lunch every day, free transportation, all of those things. It is meaningful. The labor cost in China and in Asia has gone up, but they are far more efficient and they are far more experienced. They have been doing this for, you know, decades. And the labor force in Ghana and most African countries need that training. They need those skills. Mr. BUCHANAN. Thank you. Mr. Nasser, let me ask you, did you say you were born in Kenya? Mr. NASSER. My mom was born in Kenya. My dad was born in Tanzania. Mr. BUCHANAN. Okay. Well, that is one of the areas we have been talking about for like four or five years, about a free trade agreement. That is something that clearly needs to get done. The momentum should start there. And the crazy thing is, I think it is very, very bipartisan. I can't understand why we can't be serious and get that done in a way, because that is part of the reason we are losing. To a guy that has been in business for a long time, when I got a sense of a good acquisition, I went and closed it. And we need to close the deal with that. What are your thoughts quickly? Mr. NASSER. I think that there are a lot of opportunities in Africa. The institutions that we have there are very flexible and very adaptable. I think the biggest challenge for us, when you think about the logistics of Africa, is the lead times, and the transportation and the carrying costs associated with that long duration. We look for business continuity in business resiliency, and we like to make sure that we are diverse--there is a lot of diversification. But I think we need to have a structure in place in Africa that makes it more palatable, from an investment perspective and from a timing perspective, to make sure that we invest more in Africa. Mr. BUCHANAN. Quickly, Mr. Runde, did you have anything you wanted to add in terms of a free trade agreement there? Mr. RUNDE. We should absolutely begin negotiations for a free trade agreement with Kenya. Mr. BUCHANAN. Thank you. I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Thank you. I now recognize Ranking Member Blumenauer. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you all for being here. Ms. Muhika, you have a fascinating background in some of the more complex countries in this area. You point out in your testimony, both Haiti and sub-Saharan Africa struggle with high levels of informal employment. This increasing casualization of work can lead to rampant labor abuses and precarious income. Given the low level of government capacity and the highly informal nature of work across Africa, how can we best ensure that trade is a force for good that helps protect workers' rights and lift livelihood? I appreciate your focus on a worker-centric trade policy, and I wonder if you can elaborate on this. Ms. MUHIKA. Thank you for that important question. There are several ways that the United States Government should leverage trade policy and other laws to improve conditions of work for workers in informal sector. One of the most important approaches is improving conditions for workers in the informal sector, is to include them as stakeholders in discussions and negotiations about the development and implementation of any trade policies. Their voices are essential to having a worker-centered approach to trade. The U.S. Government should continue to invest in foreign assistance that strengthens government institutions and enables civil society to exercise fundamental labor rights. Technical assistance is vital to ensure that governments develop labor inspectorate regimes that establish effective social protection schemes for workers and that are engaged in labor diplomacy. All this to say that workers must be put at the center of any conversation on trade. Thank you. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you. Any observations from your perspective about what we should be doing in Haiti, given the chaotic situation that is there, the long-term consequences of United States failure. Do any of you have some perspective on what we should be doing in that regard? Mr. Runde? Mr. RUNDE. Thank you, Congressman. I really hope that we can renew the Haiti-HELP Act this year. The best social program in the world is a job. Companies are already leaving as we speak. I really hope that the Congress can coalesce around one bill. Let's, I hope, let not the perfect be the enemy of the good on the Haiti-HELP Act. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Further observations? Mr. Nasser. Mr. NASSER. Yeah, I think the extension of Haiti-HELP for an additional 10 years is welcome, but it would be ideal if Congress at some point can consider something more permanent for us to establish more predictability in that region. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Blumenauer. I now recognize Mr. LaHood from Illinois. Mr. LaHOOD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the witnesses for your valuable testimony here today and adding to this conversation. I am really pleased that we are holding this hearing today regarding trade preference programs that of course are due to lapse in 2025, including AGOA and certain programs for imports from Haiti. Trade preference programs like AGOA and GSP serve as important mechanisms for the U.S. to encourage global economic growth and promote American goodwill and trade priorities abroad. We have heard a little bit this morning obviously about the competition that we have with China and Russia, and other adversaries, particularly in Africa. I also serve on our Select Committee on China and also on the Intelligence Committee. And as we think about, how do we win the strategic competition against the CCP and China, particularly in Africa, I think you do that on the economic front. So things like AGOA, things like engagement, need to be there. And I would say, as we compete against Belt and Road and a number of other initiatives from our adversaries, we need to highlight that what we focus and predicate our policies on, are competition, the rule of law, enforcement mechanisms, things that work. Sometimes it is very hard to compete against China and Russia and others because they don't play by the same sets of rules and standards that every other industrialized country in the world does, and that puts us at a disadvantage. So I just want to mention that as we think about how do we compete in this space. I also want to acknowledge Trade Subcommittee Chairman Adrian Smith for his leadership in advancing the renewal of these programs, particularly this bill to renew and update GSP, which was advanced out of the Ways and Means Committee in April. And I am committed to working with you, Chairman Smith, and our colleagues on the committee to get this legislation across the finish line. It is vitally important when we think about our economic diplomacy around the globe. In my view, it is crucial that the United States continue these programs as an effective countermeasure to the CCP and their efforts to replace the United States as a global economic leader. I will also mention, I serve as the co-chair of the Digital Trade Caucus, and I have been especially concerned about China's digital trade and domestic regulatory laws that promote surveillance, allow for worker and human rights violations, and run counter to our American ideals. Moreover, China is now exporting these principles through targeted initiatives like the Digital Silk Road, which is a series of developmental projects intended to build up countries' telecommunication networks, AI capabilities, e- commerce, and mobile payment systems, and surveillance technologies. They are rampant throughout much of Africa and other Third World countries. It is my view that the United States needs to promote a strong agenda when it comes to digital trade and explore ways to modernize our trade programs, bringing them into the 21st century. Mr. Runde, I am going to start with you. In your written testimony, you highlight that the U.S. has failed to recognize Africa's growing digital economy, opening the door for China to capitalize on our absent guidance there. In your opinion, how can the United States regain its leadership in this space, and what steps can we make to ensure that we do not get in our own way again? Mr. RUNDE. Thank you, Congressman. We can't fight something with nothing, and so we need to have a new digital partnership with China. We ought to be investing in training and capacity- building in Africa around digital issues. We should be supporting ICT policy development. We should also be incentivizing rip-and-replace. Seventy percent of 4G in Africa is Huawei. We do not want the digital rails of the future of Africa controlled by the unholy trinity of Huawei, Alipay, and ZTE. Mr. LaHOOD. Thank you for that. And with my remaining time, Mr. Runde, could you elaborate on what changes you think could be made to AGOA to better develop commercial partnerships and facilitate digital trade more effectively? If you can comment on that, and then I have a follow-up. Mr. RUNDE. Yeah. So I think--I suggest in my testimony that language could be included to develop a partnership around emerging international standards and reducing barriers to digital trade in Africa, including cross-border data flows and internet access. I think we ought to be thinking about using our foreign assistance and the DFC and the EXIM Bank as wrap-arounds to AGOA, and I think there could be language in the legislation that reflects that. Mr. LaHOOD. And as we think about that, if you look at the digital chapters that we put into USMCA as kind of a benchmark and a model, I mean, is that what we ought to be looking at in terms of a bilateral digital trade agreement with countries like Kenya and others? Mr. RUNDE. Yes. I think we should have a Kenya free trade agreement, and we should begin negotiations as soon as possible. And I would like to also see, yes, I would like to see--I think we should be working toward--I think the USMCA digital chapter is what we should be working towards. Mr. LaHOOD. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Mr. LaHood. I now recognize Mr. Kildee from Michigan. Mr. KILDEE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Blumenauer also, for holding this really important hearing, and I agree with much of the sentiment that has been expressed, most particularly, Mr. Runde, you made the point that the U.S. presence is not nearly adequate for us to have any of our values manifest in the relationship that we have, nor any of our values manifest for the people of the African continent. It makes a difference where the investment comes from and where the relationships are built, and if we defer to our adversaries, we have no ability, really, to have a meaningful impact on the continent. I will be joining Mr. Buchanan on this delegation next week, so I very much look forward to exploring these issues much further. And I also agree that reauthorization of AGOA with, I think, significant improvements, is absolutely necessary for us to achieve the goals that we have been addressing. And I think in particular, it would be a mistake for us to reauthorize without using the opportunity to elevate these relationships, specifically--and this has been referenced--in the area of worker rights, where the USMCA example, I think, is actually a pretty good one. Not only do we have pretty significant professions but also an enforcement mechanism built in and some prerequisites, some pre-requirements, in order for the benefits to go into effect. I am curious, and I wonder if I could start with Ms. Muhika, if you could talk a little bit about some of the implementation strategies. I mean, it is already embedded in AGOA that there is a requirement to comply with internationally recognized worker rights provisions. But if you could address how these National Action Plans on business and human rights in several African countries, particularly Kenya, are being used to pursue implementation of what we already have agreed to pursue. Ms. MUHIKA. Thank you. I think it is too early to assess the impact of National Action Plans on business and human rights. For example, as you have stated, Kenya adopted its first NAPs in 2019, while Uganda in 2021, and several other countries are in the process of developing their own National Action Plans. The United States can support trade unions and workers to participate in the development of these plans in their countries, alongside other stakeholders from civil society organizations. Mr. KILDEE. Thank you. All right. I know it has been mentioned, specifically regarding Kenya, that the administration is pursuing an executive-level agreement. I agree with some of my colleagues that we ought to be pursuing a full bilateral trade agreement that has all of the necessary mechanisms for enforcement and implementation. But I wonder, Ms. Muhika, if you could comment specifically, I have been concerned that earlier this year, members of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists, and Dentists Union, including the General Secretary of that organization, were reportedly attacked for peaceably protesting some differences that they had with Kenya's healthcare system. What can we do, what can the U.S. do to prevent those sorts of practices, those sorts of attacks, including specific attacks on labor leaders, which has a chilling effect on advocacy on behalf of workers? Ms. MUHIKA. Thank you for that important question. I am a Kenyan citizen, and I only moved here to Washington, D.C. last 6 months. So I totally understand your concern. And as it regards to the Kenyan doctors, where we saw a blatant attack on Kenya's Secretary-General of the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union, Dr. Davji--and I must say that he is a personal friend of mine. Before I took on my current role, I was the country program director for the Solidarity Center based in Nairobi. So I did work alongside the doctors union in Kenya and many other unions for about 4 or 5 years--I believe that the United States Government can play a critical role in preventing such attacks on workers and on labor leaders. First, the U.S. Government must continue to support mechanisms that can provide resources to human rights defenders under threat or in exile. In moments of acute crisis, we know our partners rely on our support from the--rely on support from the United States to enable them to access legal representation, relocation assistance, and medical services. Second, labor leaders under threat benefit from the United States public support. When senior United States Government officials meet with workers and labor leaders, when ambassadors invite labors leaders to the United States embassies, when elected representatives take time to connect with workers during overseas travel, like what you are doing next week, and as you have possibly done on many occasions, it affords them a profile that offers them protection, and it makes a difference to the workers personally. And I will conclude my interventions there. Thank you. Mr. KILDEE. I appreciate it. I wish I had more time because I would love to hear from the other panelists. Maybe some of you can comment as we pursue this. And, finally, before we depart for this delegation, if any of you have specific issues that you would like us to raise in the various places we will be visiting, please reach out to our offices. I would appreciate it very much. Thank you. Mr. RUNDE. What countries are you visiting? Mr. KILDEE. Kenya, Tanzania, Gambia, and Cabo Verde. Chairman SMITH. All right. Thank you. Next, I recognize Mr. Estes from Kansas. Mr. ESTES. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to all of our witnesses for being here today. You know, as a representative from Kansas' 4th Congressional District, I am honored to represent many farmers and ranchers in Kansas. You know, agriculture is a major economic industry in my home state. Kansas is the number-one producer of wheat and sorghum and number-three producer in cattle and beef processor in the United States. Agriculture trade is a key way the Sunflower State connects with the rest of the world, including sub-Saharan Africa. In fact, in 2023, Kansas exported goods valued at $294 million to sub-Saharan Africa. Last fall, I visited Ethiopia and Rwanda to engage in and advance discussions on trade with the United States among several other items. In Kansas, wheat farmers recently returned from a trade mission to sub-Saharan Africa where they were seeking to bolster the relationship between the United States and the region in hopes of strengthening and expanding access to the international markets. Kansas ag producers benefit from open markets and free and fair trade, and, hopefully, the renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act, AGOA, will help expand market access. It is crucial that we have these conversations now so that we can renew AGOA before it lapses next September. Mr. Runde, in renewing AGOA, how can we assure fair market access commitments for U.S. agricultural products? Mr. RUNDE. Thank you, Congressman. I do think that--a couple of things. There has been some issues around pork and chicken, in particular in certain countries in Africa, specifically South Africa. I know a number of pork producers have expressed concern about that. AGOA has the ability to resolve--it has in it the resolution of bilateral trade disputes as one of the reasons by which they qualify for AGOA benefits. So if we have bilateral trade disputes in agriculture, we ought to be using AGOA qualification as saying, hey, you know, if you want to qualify, let's try and work this out. I also think--it certainly seems to me that AGOA has provisions, you know, to require that barriers to U.S. exports are eliminated, including unjustified sanitary and phytosanitary barriers. I also think that, if those don't work, we ought to think about WTO formal complaints, specifically in the case of, say, South Africa. And then, finally, I have heard some good things about supporting more support for some of the USDA farm agricultural export promotion programs. So I think all of those things would be things I would consider, Congressman. Mr. ESTES. Thank you. And, obviously, one of the key goals we have with AGOA is how do we move the AGOA countries from the preferential program to, quote-unquote, graduate and be part of stronger reciprocal trade agreements. Are countries ready to make this jump, and how can we get more countries to do that? Mr. RUNDE. Thank you, Congressman. I think that we need to fix the concept of graduation. In my testimony, I said countries like Mauritius are now middle-income countries, and you basically graduate to nothing, which is terrible. When this was originally envisioned 25 years ago, the idea was this was a halfway house until we could develop free trade agreements with bilateral countries or with regions the way we have with CAFTA- DR and Latin America. I would hope, as I said in my testimony, that we would begin again to have bilateral free trade agreements in Africa. I think we should begin free trade agreement negotiations with Kenya immediately, and I also think we should be thinking about regional trade agreements with West, Southern, and East Africa. Thank you, Congressman. Mr. ESTES. Yeah. I mean, that is kind of--we kind of undercut a little bit of the value of AGOA without following up with those bilateral trade agreements once we are done. Yeah. As I mentioned earlier, one of the countries I visited last fall was Ethiopia, whose AGOA status was terminated in 2021 due to violations stemming from a civil war in the Tigray province or Tigray region. This has obviously jeopardized growth in investment in the region, and that followed the most recent AGOA renewal in 2015. Obviously, Ethiopia is part of the discussions that I had there as well as others. We would like to have that reinstated, and it is working to address those issues. Obviously, there were lots of concerns as you have rebel activity, and that happens scattered throughout the world. Given some of the heightened risk and instability, how do we make sure that we make countries recognize the value of being more participative? Are there ways we can strengthen AGOA to help with that certainty and help make it more attractive, Mr. Runde, for other countries to participate? Mr. RUNDE. So, in my testimony, I talked about that we ought to be--there are some improvements. I think that the Coons-Risch bill has some examples of some specific improvements around trade. I also think we ought to be looking at some specific initiatives around digital and mining, and we ought to use our foreign assistance in some ways to kind of be wraparounds to AGOA. Ethiopia is a really big country. We can't ignore it. We have often relied on it as sort of a security partner in that part of the world, and so I am hoping that we can get to a better place with Ethiopia at some point. Mr. ESTES. Yeah. Thank you. And free and fair trade is such an important part for the world. It has lifted more people out of poverty over the last 70 years, and we want to continue to have that. Mr. RUNDE. Trade in the private sector is what lifts people out of poverty. Foreign aid is a supporting actor in this, but the real actor is the private sector. Mr. ESTES. Right. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Estes. I now recognize Mr. Panetta from California. Mr. PANETTA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And gentlemen, ma'am, thank you for being here. Obviously, I am on the Ways and Means Committee, but I am also on the Armed Services Committee. So, obviously, trade is important, but security is important as well. And I haven't heard too much testimony about that today, and so I am going to talk about that a little bit. And yes, Mr. Runde, thank you for the thumbs up because you have got my first question. But before I get there, look, I think, obviously, we know and, as you have said, the 2025 expiration of AGOA comes as we begin an exit, though, from Niger and potentially Chad, at least militarily in our U.S. forces. We are seeing a deteriorating security environment all across the Sahel, an area that I have had help in calling a ``deja coup'' of an area, is what we are seeing. So I do believe it is critical to understand how offering market access to others in the region allows the U.S. to improve the livelihoods and create favorable conditions for new security partnerships. Access to U.S. markets is a tool that we can and should wield to advance development while supporting the ability of our African partners to hedge against security threats, including political instability and, yes, VEOs' violent extremism. I have been an advocate for more U.S. attention to the economy and security of sub-Saharan Africa, as I sit--as I mentioned, especially based on the committees that I am on. Some of the fastest growing economies in the world, as you have talked about, are located on the continent, and those same states are challenged, though--challenged, though, with porous borders, very weak governance, surges in violent extremist organizations, and an increased presence not just from China but Russia, as you mentioned as well, Mr. Runde. But securing the Sahel requires more than providing conventional military support. I think we can all agree with that. So we must support robust economies amongst our African partners to support good governance, prevent economic exploitation that threatens regional security, and enable greater influence from terrorist and extremist organizations. That said, I am curious to see how we can improve AGOA and similar programs, and I hope to hear more about how to expand upon these programs' successes and modernize them to reflect the changed security and economic realities. So, Mr. Runde, as you have heard and as you know, we got a withdrawal from--a military withdrawal from Chad, a military withdrawal from Niger. We saw it in Mali. We saw it in Burkina Faso. And we have seen a void that has been created and obviously being filled by our near peers' competition. And those types of voids, they significantly impact our counterterrorism efforts and regional surveillance capabilities as well in that area. As U.S. AFRICOM and the Department of Defense consider new security partnerships--which will be interesting to see how that develops--to backfill these strategic locations, we are also hearing concerns that some of these states may succumb to democratic backsliding, like we have seen pretty much all across the Sahel, as I mentioned. That said, you talked about improvements to AGOA. Let me ask you, do you think one of the improvements we could amend AGOA could be to enhance capability-building assistance and instill good governance? Mr. RUNDE. Thanks. The bad guys can fill voids today. So they are a near-peer, soft-power competitor, not just a near- peer, hard-power competitor. China and Russia--so China is selling security for diamonds and gas, basically. Africa is going to go from 1.1 billion to something like 2.5 billion people. There will be more African citizens than citizens of China and India in 25 years. There is a whole series of--we are going to need hundreds of millions of jobs. Either we are going to have a demographic dividend in Africa or we are going to have something else. I want a demographic dividend. So absolutely. I think AGOA is one of the pillars of our partnership. We need a whole series of other things as wraparounds. So I agree with you, Congressman, the sorts of things that you are talking about. But I do think dictatorships partner with dictatorships. So the more members of the Star Wars bar of thug regimes, you know, they are going to partner up with Russia and China. And so I think we, you know, should want to enable better democratic governance not just because it is the right thing to do, but oftentimes, democracy--there was a book written many years ago called ``The Democracy Advantage'' about how democracies ultimately, over the long term, have better economic performance. So it is in our interest. We don't want these countries making nice with China because there they are going to have these ports. There is more than 20 ports basically controlled by China, and 70 percent of the digital rails of the future of Africa are controlled by Huawei. It is not a great situation for us, sir. Mr. PANETTA. Exactly. So China is bringing the economic investment, Russia is bringing the security investment, and that puts us on the sidelines. Mr. RUNDE. Right. And so to the extent that we step back, they can fill voids. This isn't 1995 anymore whether in the Taiwan Strait or in the Sahel. Mr. PANETTA. Exactly. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks to all of you. I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Panetta. I now recognize Mrs. Miller from West Virginia. Mrs. MILLER. Thank you, Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Blumenauer, who I think is still here. Thank you all for being here today. The AGOA program has proven invaluable for economic growth of sub-Saharan countries empowering African women and increased opportunities for American producers, and it is vital that Congress commits to renewing and strengthening AGOA as soon as possible. As we begin negotiations for AGOA, it is equally important that we consider the broader goals of strengthening bilateral ties with countries around the world to counter China's malign influence. This committee has made great strides to do so through marking up critical legislation to reauthorize GSP, but we can still do better. It is imperative that we remain optimistic towards enacting free trade agreements with our allies, particularly Ecuador, as we work to renew GSP, AGOA, and the other crucial programs that we are discussing today. One important provision of both AGOA and the Haiti HOPE Act is the inclusion of apparel as an eligible product. Under AGOA, U.S. imports of apparel rose from $696 million in 2000 to $1.4 billion in 2021. In Haiti, apparel industry exports account for nearly 90 percent of total exports. Importantly, Haitians have shown resilience despite the unrest in their country and are still showing up to work. Mr. Richmond, as an employer of 5,000 workers in a developing country, how have you witnessed the apparel industry lift citizens out of poverty, and what more can Congress do to help the growth of this industry? Mr. RICHMOND. Thank you. We have witnessed great things, and that is exactly why we started our business, is that we recognize the power for good that the apparel industry has. Again, everyone we hire--right--all 5,600--okay. Maybe not all--maybe 5,500 because some of those are accountants with specialized training. But, you know, the real factory workers, they have no experience. There is no educational requirement, right? Everyone comes in. Most of them have never had a formal job. Many don't have a bank account, right? So we hire them. We train them. They get opportunity, right? They have bank accounts. They are part of the Social Security program now with the government, right? They pay taxes. All of these things that make them productive, right? And they do make a wage that not only they can live on but they can--we have countless stories of women who joined us at one level and then have been promoted to supervisory or management positions and now are paying for their siblings or others to go to school and those sorts of things. I would be happy to send, you know, separately countless stories of those that we have. Mrs. MILLER. Well, do companies like yours need a strong sense of certainty of the American preference programs in order to commit to your investments in the region? Mr. RICHMOND. Absolutely. I mean, we do and so do so many others who are, you know, looking to grow this. Again, there are so many now brands. Everyone is looking to source from Africa, but there aren't enough qualified suppliers like ourselves. There needs to be more in order to incentivize the brands to place business there, right? And ultimately--yeah. Sorry. Mrs. MILLER. Yeah. That is okay. Mr. Runde, another area of particular concern for me is our reliance on China and Russia for critical minerals. I have introduced several pieces of legislation, including the End Chinese Dominance of Electric Vehicles in America Act, to close these loopholes and to counteract the leg up our adversaries have in this sector. I appreciated hearing from you that Africa houses substantial critical mineral deposits. How could inclusion of critical minerals in AGOA benefit American producers and consumers? Mr. RUNDE. Thank you, Congresswoman, and thank you for your leadership on the Ecuador Caucus as well. Look, if we are going to have a carbon transition, we better love mining to the tips of our toes. I was at AID for a long time, and I like AID a lot. I was in the international development business, and I worked at the World Bank Group. But asking my friends in the international development community to work on mining projects, they would rather get a root canal than work on mining projects. Most people don't want to work on mining projects. We need to spend a lot more foreign aid on minerals and mining. We need to make sure it is clean, that there is fair money, that people are getting a fair share of the resources, and that the people are treated well labor-wise. Mrs. MILLER. Okay. Quickly. Quickly. Mr. RUNDE. Yeah. Shoot. Mrs. MILLER. I want to ask you about the Chinese trade agreements in South America---- Mr. RUNDE. Yeah. Mrs. MILLER . And what an individual preference program for a country like Ecuador could mean for competing in the region and the possibility of a full free trade agreement. Mr. RUNDE. We absolutely should have a free trade agreement with Ecuador. I think the IDEA Act is okay, but I think if China has a free trade agreement with Ecuador, it is a lost opportunity for us. So if they are to join the Caribbean Basin Initiative, I think it is okay. I am in agreement that we should have a free trade agreement with Ecuador as soon as possible. We have a pro- American President. There is going to be an election in Ecuador soon. They have been knocking on our door for a while. We ought to show up for our friends. Mrs. MILLER. Thank you so much. I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Mrs. Miller. I now recognize Ms. DelBene from Washington state. Ms. DelBENE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Blumenauer, for holding this important meeting. And thank you to all of our witnesses for joining us and taking the time today. Like many of my colleagues, I believe that AGOA is a critical tool in the American foreign policy arsenal to promote development and create jobs in sub-Saharan Africa. It has also led to jobs and economic growth in Washington State. We are one of the most trade-dependent States in the country, and my friend and former colleague of Washington State, Congressman Jim McDermott, was one of the original authors of AGOA back in the early 2000s. So while AGOA has been transformational for certain African economies and certain sectors, there is so much more the U.S. should be doing to meet the economic needs on the continent, and if we succeed, American workers and our economic security and theirs will be better off, also. I know you were in mid-discussion on this. Mr. Runde, in your testimony, you recommend that Congress modernize AGOA by focusing on Africa's digital economy as well as critical minerals. I wanted to see if you could say a little bit more and discuss the benefits and challenges of allowing AGOA beneficiary countries, perhaps those that meet certain heightened labor and environmental criteria, access to American tax credits for EVs and batteries. Mr. RUNDE. Thanks. I have put a lot of time into trying to understand this issue. As I understand it, there are no countries in Africa today that currently make electric vehicles nor make electric batteries, so--and there are no tariffs on basic raw materials and materials today. So I understand the--so I am interested in finding ways for us to support mining and minerals in Africa. It is not--we need to be doing a lot more to--I think the minerals--the minerals security partnership, I think, is a--we should be doing a lot more in Africa around that. If we are going to have a line item in AGOA or some sort of language in AGOA specifically about a--for AGOA eligibility for the IRA, it is going to be for the future. As of right now, we would have to think about 3 to 5 or 7 years from now. So I think we should be doing a lot more with the minerals security--with the minerals strategic partnership--the security partnership, and we should be using a lot more of our foreign assistance both bilaterally and using the DFC. We need to be doing a lot more in flooding the zone on minerals with our soft power. Ms. DelBENE. Thank you. And I also wanted to ask you a little bit more--building off of Congressman LaHood's question--what we can do to help African entrepreneurs sell online--this is on the digital side--sell online or how we can help finance Africa's broadband build-out. Mr. RUNDE. Thank you. I do think we need a new partnership with Africa--a new digital partnership with Africa. I think that AGOA can call for that. I think we can have it call for that in the legislation. I do think there are a series of things we can be doing around supporting ICT policy development, training. I also think we ought to make available money for rip and replace of Huawei. 70 percent of the 4G in Africa is controlled by Huawei. I mean, this is crazy. I mean, we are not going to be--you know, this is very, very bad. I do think that, you know, the USMCA digital chapter, I think, is the gold standard, and we should work--we should all be--we should be--all of our trade agreements in the future should work towards the USMCA digital chapter. Ms. DelBENE. Or try to provide some type of digital--I mean, there is obviously doing full agreements. Folks have also looked at other ways to do digital, so---- Mr. RUNDE. Yeah. I would love to see us have a bilateral free trade agreement with Kenya, and I would love us to go return to seeking free trade agreements in Africa. Ms. DelBENE. Are there other particular countries? Mr. RUNDE. Yes. Certainly, Kenya, I would start immediately. Ms. DelBENE. I think Kenya is there. I was wondering if there is anyone outside of Kenya that would be---- Mr. RUNDE. We ought to think about potentially regional trade agreements along the lines of CAFTA-DR. I would say West Africa, East Africa, and Southern Africa. That would be the other thing I would do. Ms. DelBENE. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Thank you. I now recognize Mr. Arrington from Texas. Mr. ARRINGTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Witnesses today, we appreciate your insights. I will be taking my first CODEL outside of my freshman trip to Israel to Africa this week to meet with leaders of several African nations, some of which are included in this trade partnership. I am not a trade expert, but my understanding is that the benefit to both parties and specifically to the United States for doing AGOA-like trade deals is to integrate supply chains with the U.S. and not China, to provide maybe cheaper inputs for manufacturers in the U.S. with products coming from, in this case, AGOA nations, and to develop that relationship so that, as it matures, as their market markets and economies mature, we can have this sort of more developed and more mature bilateral and reciprocal trade relationship where we are not only giving AGOA partners access to our markets with their goods, but they are opening their markets to the U.S. equally for our goods and services. In the case of agriculture, I hail from west Texas where we generate a lot of ag and energy products, and when I look at the data on the tariffs in Kenya on ag products like peanuts, sorghum, beef, and dairy, it is anywhere from 25 percent to over 50 percent. And those are just the tariff barriers, and there are non-tariff barriers that I won't enumerate. And then you look at Ghana's average ag tariff, which is 17.5 percent, Nigeria 15.9. Our average tariff in the United States is five percent. So, at some point, this needs to be a two-way street, a mutually beneficial relationship that has matured beyond just the initial investment in AGOA. We are 25 years now into this. I don't know. It seems to me we ought to be asking the question, why hasn't it developed further? I am all for AGOA, from what I understand of it, and that there have been benefits accrued to both sides of the deal, but we are 25 years into it, and we are still--we still don't have the reciprocity and the fair access that I think we should expect as American policymakers. So, I guess, Mr. Runde, I would ask you first, is that a fair characterization? Is that a realistic expectation 25 years later into this deal? Mr. RUNDE. Thank you, Congressman. I 100 percent agree with you. It has been 25 years. The world has changed. Africa has changed. We have changed. There are about 450,000 U.S. jobs linked to U.S.-Africa trade. So it is not totally a one-way street. And there is something like 1.3 million African jobs linked to--that is sustained by AGOA, but we have not met the full potential of AGOA by any stretch of the imagination. When it was set up, as I mentioned earlier, it was meant as sort of a halfway house for us to start building free trade partnerships with Africa. We are now starting to see several things happen in the last 25 years. We are now having countries becoming middle-income status like Mauritius. They are about to graduate--given the current rules, they could graduate to nothing because we were going to set up free trade agreements. Unfortunately, there has been a decrease in appetite of political will for us to pursue free trade agreements in the United States, and I regret that very much. And the other thing I would say that is different from 25 years ago is China is eating our lunch---- Mr. ARRINGTON. Eating our lunch. Mr. RUNDE . On the continent. Mr. ARRINGTON. Yeah. Yeah. I get that sense, too. Somebody told me that, in the last couple of decades, they have doubled their trade and export to the African continent. Do you have better data on that? Mr. RUNDE. Yeah. So our trade with Africa is one-fifth the amount that China has with Africa. Mr. ARRINGTON. Well, and ours is going down and theirs is going up---- Mr. RUNDE. Yeah. Mr. ARRINGTON . At about the same rate. Mr. RUNDE. And they are probably the number-one trading partner for several dozen African countries when it was zero 25 years ago. Mr. ARRINGTON. We need to be a lot more aggressive. Mr. Chairman, we have to have a higher expectation from our partners, and I hope we move forward in that way. Last question, Mr. Nasser, for you. We are the largest cotton patch in the world. A third of the cotton exported out of United States comes from a 100-mile radius of Lubbock, America, which is where I live. It is the largest population center in my district. And the rules of origin requirements are important in AGOA so that we are benefiting both countries and that--the textile supply chain is one that is benefiting us because it is including the AGOA nation raw cotton product and the United States. Is that being enforced as--if it is not adequately being enforced, how are people taking advantage of that, and how do we ensure that those provisions, and that one in particular, are being enforced so we are benefiting both countries in the fullness of the supply chain in cotton in particular? Mr. NASSER. Yeah. So I can speak from a macroeconomic perspective if it is being enforced. I can tell you that we adhere to the right standards and compliances within our supply chain. Mr. ARRINGTON. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Arrington. I now recognize Ms. Sanchez from California. Ms. SANCHEZ. Thank you. I want to thank the ranking member and the chairman for holding a hearing on this important issue. It is pretty clear that the U.S. can't simply focus on providing aid to emerging economies, whether it is sub-Saharan Africa or Haiti, to develop. Africa features some of the world's fastest growing economies and a booming young population, which creates the perfect environment for both American and African businesses to thrive if we can get this right. U.S. investments, market access, and economic incentives can fuel job creation. It can also boost local economies and help develop new innovative industries in those emerging economies. AGOA has created a generation of young women entrepreneurs and significantly improved women labor participation rates across Africa, which is a very good thing. So Congress should not let a program like this go without being renewed, like we did with PEPFAR, because these are programs that really do create great partnerships and create good outcomes. We have to show emerging economies that we can be a reliable economic partner, even though their, you know, economies are cyclical--they go up, they go down, people may experience turbulent economic times--but if we were to reauthorize AGOA in our trade preferences with Haiti, I think that that would garner a lot of good will, not to mention, as I said, the economic partnerships that can be created. Having said that, though, as many of my colleagues have said, we are all very much in favor of reauthorizing AGOA. We should take this opportunity to try to improve it, try to make some needed reforms to these programs, because just creating market access alone is not going to be enough to stimulate the economic development that we are looking to see in Africa. So I am hopeful that we can come to agreement on what we can do to update AGOA to make it a better agreement for both of us. We know that in some of the countries that we trade with, there are issues that still linger of gender-based violence, of hereditary and child slavery. We know that there are many places around the world and many partners that we trade with that continue to have issues with worker rights. And we know that this is, you know, not unique to Africa, certainly, but we do see that there are those ongoing problems that we need to address. And, you know, that is despite the fact that we do have a worker rights emphasis in the AGOA eligibility criteria. In Haiti, which has, you know, been very challenging, wage theft and worker exploitation issues have really harmed the Haitian population, and that has just further aggravated the poor economic conditions in that country. As I said, we have an opportunity to do better, and I think we must do better. My first question is for Ms. Muhika. An innovative labor agreement that has emerged from the AGOA garment sector is a multi-stakeholder agreement to stop gender-based violence in Lesotho. That binding agreement is the first instance in which apparel brands and their suppliers entered into enforceable agreements with workers, specifically to stop gender-based violence. In addition to expanding on the significance of that agreement, I would be interested to hear your thoughts on how the U.S. can use its trade policy to encourage agreements among producers, labor advocates, and civil society groups, specifically to address labor violations. Ms. MUHIKA. Thank you, Ms. Sanchez, for that important question. And I would like to reiterate that the Solidarity Center is proud to have supported the agreements that you are talking about in Lesotho. I think the U.S. development assistance policy should support the role of unions in advocating for labor rights in the context of trade, and this should include the USAID missions, you know, across the world, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. And then, lastly, the U.S. Government must prioritize worker-centered trade policies, leveraging trade agreements and trade preference programs to achieve enforceable labor laws and to compel the establishment of binding mechanisms that meaningfully address rights violations. All this to say that the U.S. Government has the opportunity to be a leader, to show that when you send our workers in labor policies or trade policies, you are doing the right thing. Thank you. Ms. SANCHEZ. Thank you. I have one more question. I am almost out of time, but I would accept the answer in writing after. Mr. Runde, in your written testimony, you recommended that Congress can consider including language on critical minerals in AGOA, and while I agree that the U.S. should look to new markets, I do have concerns that emerging economies that are rich in natural resources--like many of the countries in Africa--have been, in the past, subject to exploitation, including environmental and labor exploitation which actually undermines their development. So, my question for you--which I will take in writing after--is how can the U.S. work with African countries, including through our development financing tools, to create vertically integrated supply chains rather than just extracting the raw resources? And I thank the chairman for his indulgence, and I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Thank you. I now recognize Mr. Smucker from Pennsylvania. Mr. SMUCKER. Thank you, Chairman Smith, for convening today's important hearing. I do want to echo my colleagues' calls for an on-time renewal of AGOA. It is important that we prevent any lapse in the program to give certainty to the businesses that have invested in sub-Saharan Africa or plan to. They need to know that those incentives will remain in place. I also want to join my colleagues in expressing to the Biden administration that there is bipartisan support in Congress to deepen our trade relationship with Africa, and I urge the administration to resume dialogue on the U.S.-Kenya Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Runde, you know, we have discussed a lot--there have been a lot of people before me here. We have talked about areas of reform to strengthen the trade ties. We have talked expanding--from graduation policies, expanding agriculture access, reforms to grow the apparel sector. Anything else? Any other ideas that you have for reform that we should consider that haven't yet been raised today? Mr. RUNDE. Yeah. So I do think--certainly, a 10-year renewal or a 16-year renewal, as is in the Coons-Risch bill that is kind of mimicking the USMCA language. Mr. SMUCKER. Businesses want the long-term predictability? Mr. RUNDE. Yeah. I think that is good. I also think the current arrangement--there is, like, an annual review. It is pretty onerous. I think we could have reviewing the eligibility every 3 years instead of every 1 year. I think that would be another simple thing we could do. So I think those are things that I think--I also think some of the proposals for giving a broader menu for the executive branch and not just having an on-off switch. I think those are all good things, Congressman. Mr. SMUCKER. Okay. Great. Critical mineral supply chains have been talked about as a critical issue for the country. We want to move some of that out of China. I know you have mentioned it, but how can AGOA help with that? How is that important? Mr. RUNDE. So, as I said, as of right now, there are no African countries making electric vehicles or making electric batteries, and there are no tariffs on--specifically on raw materials themselves or minerals. I do think, though, that we ought to be--we ought to be doing a lot more with Africa on minerals. There is the Mineral Security Partnership that we need to be--we should be engaging a lot more aggressively in Africa. I do think that we need to be putting a lot of our foreign assistance--a lot more of our foreign assistance and development finance resources on mining and minerals. I don't think the American people are going to accept switching from the internal combustion engine to electric vehicles and batteries controlled by the People's Republic of China. It just will stop. Mr. SMUCKER. Thank you. Mr. Richmond, your story is really fascinating. The apparel sector represents a logical area for AGOA partners to fill in the missing pieces so that fabrics cannot only be sourced domestically but also processed and transformed to a finished good all within the African continent. From your experience operating in Africa--you have talked about this already, but--you know, what are some of the things that would continue to allow the industry to flourish? What are some of the things that have held it back from doing that at this point? Mr. RICHMOND. Thank you for the question because then there are a few points that I have made notes about from some other things that I would also like to address. First of all, there was a question about investment timing, right? So, again, key to the apparel textile industry in Africa and under AGOA is building these textile mills, having those inputs available. I will give a real-world example of our own, right? We have already engaged with the IFC. We have gone through due diligence and everything to establish a new textile mill in Ghana--right--which would be a unique fabric that eliminates 99 percent of the water use from traditional fabric in the way it is dyed, right? This is a somewhere from $15- to $20 million investment that we are interested in making. Mr. SMUCKER. Sure. Mr. RICHMOND. We can't do that today, right? We don't know if AGOA is going to be renewed. Mr. SMUCKER. Yeah. Mr. RICHMOND. So that is on hold. That is just us. We are just one small player. Mr. SMUCKER. That leads to sort of my next question, which is, you know, you have been planning and you have hired thousands of workers---- Mr. RICHMOND. Yeah. Mr. SMUCKER . Based on the idea that AGOA exists and will continue to exist, and I am sure now, as you are thinking ahead for the company, your strategic planning has to look very different and there has got to be a lot of questions there. Mr. RICHMOND. Yes. It does include--that is why we are interested in looking at doing our own mills--textile mill, and there are others, you know, in West Africa who are investing, you know, a couple hundred million dollars that we know of to build out that vertical cotton supply, right? That is key, and that is what is going to happen. But it also goes to, like, this utilization question about why, after 20, 25 years, hasn't there been more of an impact. I mean, I think we all know that, as a country, we have bought from China, right? For the last 20, 25 years, we were all--they made it very easy for us to buy from China. It is not easy to do business in Africa, right? But the Chinese made it very easy and made it very comfortable for all of the brands to just buy everything there. Now, of course, there is this tremendous focus on how can we source elsewhere, and now it is that investment that needs to happen. I think that, over the next 20 years, that if there is a long-term, you know, renewal of AGOA--I think 20 years from now, we will see a completely--it will be a completely different conversation than what is having today. Mr. SMUCKER. Well said. I am out of time, but thank you. Mr. RICHMOND. Thank you. Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Smucker. I now recognize Ms. Sewell from Alabama. Ms. SEWELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank you and the ranking member for having this hearing. I am a very strong supporter of AGOA, and I really appreciate our conversation today has heightened the fact that it is a bipartisan and bicameral support for renewal of AGOA. I, in recent months, have met directly with AGOA country leadership, civil society, and the business communities about the importance of AGOA but also what we can do to improve it. I most recently traveled with Chairman Jason Smith on a trade CODEL to Africa. We visited Benin. We visited Mauritius and Madagascar. And I can tell you that a lot of the countries were really nervous about reauthorization and were requesting it be reauthorized this year partly because of what you said, Mr. Richmond. Companies need to have assurances. You are placing bets on materials, supply chain, way into the future and want some assurances. I also know that reauthorization without trying to reform would be a missed opportunity. When I think about the kinds of reforms, I am thinking about smoothing out graduation requirements. I am talking about--you said something about the annual review process and making it either biannual or every 3 years. Consider strengthening our labor and environmental standards for them as well as looking at strengthening enforcement generally. Having said all of that, I want to kind of go along the lines that my colleague, Linda Sanchez, did. I think it is a missed opportunity if we are not trying to build supply chains within Africa. Instead of just extracting minerals or extracting cotton, how about creating real supply chains? Mr. Runde, will you talk a little bit about that and how we can strengthen AGOA and actually strengthen the economic viability of Africa if we are not just extracting but we are rather helping to build? Mr. RUNDE. Thank you, Congresswoman, and thank you for your leadership on AGOA. So, I think, after COVID, when the People's Republic of China said they were going to cut off our pills and cut off our ventilators, that was grounds for a divorce. And I think it creates an opportunity for Africa, so--in terms of friend- shoring, near-shoring, ally-shoring. So having AGOA as sort of a basic rules of the game is critical for that to happen. I do think that, as I mentioned in my testimony, I mean, Africa is a very different place than it was 25 years ago when this was enacted. They are more smart. Ms. SEWELL. And it will be even more different 25 years from now. Mr. RUNDE. Twenty five years--yeah. It is going to be--and so, you know, your trip, I am sure, made that clear. Mauritius was not a middle-income country 25 years ago---- Ms. SEWELL. And now it is. Mr. RUNDE . And now it is. Ms. SEWELL. And it is afraid to graduate. Mr. RUNDE. It is afraid to graduate because it graduates to nothing and loses it. So I am very much tracking your comments, Congresswoman. So I think all of the things that you have suggested, I think, make a ton of sense. I think we should--I think we need to pass AGOA, and then we need to think about a 21st century partnership with Africa. So I think we need to lift our sights and see--I mean, Africa has got a lot more partners. They don't have to wait around for us. They have got--there are two generations of successful entrepreneurs. You have met them. Ms. SEWELL. Absolutely. Mr. RUNDE. They would like to work with us, but we have got to show up. Ms. SEWELL. And also, with respect to bilateral agreements, I agree with you that we should be doing those. Can you talk a little bit about the benefits of bilateral agreements in addition to having these trade preference agreements in--trade preference programs with AGOA? Mr. RUNDE. Thank you, Congresswoman. So I think we ought to pursue a free trade agreement with Kenya. I think it would set a model for future agreements in Africa. We need to create a path towards bilateral and regional trade agreements with Africa. That was the vision 25 years ago by the folks who were on this dais 25 years ago. I think we should fulfill that vision. I think that it is a--so I think we should--you know, I think that if we get a free trade right with Kenya, also with the African--the AfCFTA, the regional agreement--like, the train is leaving the station. Ms. SEWELL. Those would be really great. I agree. Mr. Richmond, I was talking about supply chains and creating opportunities--direct opportunities for Africa to not just supply the cotton and then send it abroad to make the apparel. Can you add to that your thoughts on creating better supply chains in Africa? Mr. RICHMOND. Yeah. I mean, it is necessary, right? Like I said, there are--you know, I know in Benin and Togo, it has started already to do that. West Africa, obviously, has a tremendous amount of cotton, and it is a shame that, historically, it has been sent out and all the value has been extracted elsewhere and reimported. Ms. SEWELL. Exactly. Mr. RICHMOND. But, absolutely, that is what needs to happen. Ms. SEWELL. Well, Mr. Chairman, I know that people are anxious to get it reauthorized soon, soon, soon. I think we should really take our time to make sure that we are using this as an opportunity not just to reauthorize but to improve and to offer some really meaningful reforms for AGOA as well, obviously, with in mind to pass it in 2025. Thanks. Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Ms. Sewell. Now, I recognize Mrs. Fischbach from Minnesota. Mrs. FISCHBACH. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I appreciate it. Thank you to all of you for being here. This is critical stuff. And I think it was Mr. Arrington mentioned agriculture and maybe even Mr. Estes had mentioned it, and I am from a heavy ag district, and so it is a critical export for us. And one of the things--I think that it was Mr. Estes that just kind of glanced on the pork issue. And it is a huge export. About 30 percent of the pork produced is exported. But my understanding is that, in South Africa, it--the U.S. pork exports only account for about 1.3 percent of the pork imported into South Africa. And it is not necessarily that they are not eating pork. It is some unscientific issues, trade barriers that are in line. And maybe, Mr. Runde, if you want to--you are nodding, so I am sure you have got something to add on that. Mr. RUNDE. So, first, I eat a lot of bacon, and so thank you--I want to thank the producers of your district for all that they are doing. So please pass that along. I think President Obama had similar concerns about pork in South Africa. And I do think that the pork manufacturers--the pork producers in the United States should be emphasizing the job losses in the United States to these unscientific, unjustified sanitary and phytosanitary barriers. And AGOA has, as I mentioned earlier--that part of it to qualify is the resolution of bilateral trade disputes. This is starting--in the Obama administration, it was seen as a bilateral trade dispute. So I do think that it certainly falls in that category. And then I also think AGOA has provisions to require that these barriers--these unjustified sanitary and phytosanitary barriers be addressed. And, finally, I think that--I would hope that the Biden administration might consider bringing this as a formal complaint to the WTO. So I understand your constituents' concerns, and I share them. Mrs. FISCHBACH. So USTR should be pursuing this? Mr. RUNDE. Absolutely, Congresswoman. Mrs. FISCHBACH. Okay. I appreciate that. Just kind of on another note, as we have been talking, you talk a lot about the free trade agreement, and, unfortunately-- and I will get--they are not pursuing them. The Biden administration is not pursuing them right now, and it is very disappointing not only for ag but for a lot of other industries that are not able to take advantage of those. As a matter of fact, I was in Ecuador with Chairman Jason Smith on a visit there, and we see China moving in, and we are not pursuing those free trade agreements. And so we are going to really lose out on a lot of what is going on. But you have something to add? Mr. RUNDE. Yeah. Thanks, Congresswoman. As I said earlier, our trade with Africa is one-fifth the trade activity with China. In Ecuador, we have had two--we have a pro-American President. There is going to be an election coming up. They had to sign a free trade agreement with China. They really would like to sign one with us. They have been knocking on our door. We are not showing up for them. I think the IDEA Act is okay as a halfway house. I would like us to have a full free trade agreement with Ecuador. So I agree with you, Congresswoman. And so I think part of it is we can't fight something with nothing, so what is our something? Mrs. FISCHBACH. Yeah. I absolutely agree. We really should be pursuing those. And maybe if anybody else has anything else to add about maybe ag trade? I mean, I would appreciate any kind of or any-- nope? Okay. Well, I will yield back, but I do appreciate you being here. And it is a huge concern for not only ag trade but free trade. Thanks. Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Mrs. Fischbach. I now recognize, from Virginia, Mr. Beyer. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I thank all of you for being here. Mr. Runde, I want to follow up on your conversation with Congresswoman Sewell about reforming AGOA. Senator Coons and Senator Risch, in a bipartisan way, have proposed that countries maintain high-income status for a period of 5 consecutive years in order to graduate, and others have proposed graduating sectors once they reach certainly thresholds rather than graduating the entire country. You know, graduating this sector, hold that sector. How should we assess the merits of these proposals? Mr. RUNDE. Thank you, Congressman. So I think that the original concept of graduation was to imagine that they would graduate to free trade agreements. Unfortunately, we don't have free trade agreements. My suggestion would be is that we allow them to--African countries to stay even if they achieve middle-income status. So I think the current arrangement certainly isn't workable with Mauritius basically graduating to nothing and losing their status. So I would like us to raise our sights and return to an agenda of free trade agreements in Africa, whether it is Kenya and elsewhere. That was the original intent 25 years ago. So I think the Coons-Risch bill is excellent. I have a few quibbles with it, but I think--on that specific issue, I think it is--what I will argue for is to keep countries in until there is a time that we have free trade agreements with Africa. Mr. BEYER. Thank you. Mr. Runde, I am also curious about your thoughts on the frequency of AGOA country assessments. One of the criticisms we hear from the private sector is we have to do this every year. And there are proposals to do it every 2 years, every 3 years. What would you think about decreasing the frequency, and would that incentivize firms to invest more in sub-Saharan Africa? Mr. RUNDE. So I think it is a great idea. I think it is burdensome to the countries, and I think it is a--I think every 3 years, I think, would be an appropriate number, sir. Mr. BEYER. One last AGOA question. The binary nature of it. You are in or you are not. When countries fall out of compliance, we have no choice. I have talked to U.S. Trade Rep Katherine Tai a number of times about Ethiopia, you know, failing on a human rights thing and getting kicked out, regardless of the impact that it could have on the long-term stability laws, regardless of the impact of who it is affecting in the country. You suggest a menu of enforcement options: Warnings, probation periods, and the like. What are the advantages to this nonbinary approach? Mr. RUNDE. Thank you, Congressman. I think that the Coons- Risch bill has a very good menu. I think AGOA is a trade mechanism, not a political mechanism. I am sorely tempted to find sticks against South Africa. I think what they are doing with China and Russia is obnoxious. I don't like how they are treating Israel. We can agree or disagree. But I just think that I find that the South African Government is--you know, has moved from being nonaligned to something else, and so I can understand the temptation to find a stick. I think we need a menu of options, whether it is informal warnings, probationary periods, and partial termination of benefits. Also, a lot of the sectors that are more pro-West, including agriculture and others, that are beneficiaries of AGOA and South Africa would be unduly punished for the actions of the South African Government if we were to use this as a stick. Mr. BEYER. Thank you. Ms. Muhika, you have this unique role as the program director for the Solidarity Center in Ethiopia and other East African countries, so like--probably unlike most of the panel, you come at this from a left-of-center perspective from a labor perspective. Can you give us any hope or any sense that there will be a world in which free trade agreements agree again? Clearly, the Biden administration has not been enthusiastic about it. We expect none in the remainder of the year. If in a, you know, different world, Ambassador Lighthizer comes back, again, there was no enthusiasm under his leadership for free trade agreements. When can the pro-free and fair trade advocates among us have some hope for free trade agreements again? Ms. MUHIKA. Thank you for that question. I would like to get back to you comprehensively in writing as I would not want to speak about free trade agreements right now. Thank you. Mr. BEYER. Well, in my 33 seconds, Mr. Runde, do you have an opinion? Mr. RUNDE. So I do think--I think all of our trade agreements starting with the GAD had a Great Power Competition push behind it. So I think there are geoeconomic--if I can use that term--geopolitical and geoeconomic drivers oftentimes behind our trade agreements, and I think--I fear that Great Power Competition with China is what is going to bring us back to the table on free trade agreements. So soon, it is going to be that. Mr. BEYER. Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chair. Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Beyer. Next, Mr. Kustoff from Tennessee. Mr. KUSTOFF. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to the witnesses for appearing today. Mr. Runde, if I could with you--and I know that my colleague asked about pork. Maybe if I could ask about poultry. I represent Tennessee's 8th Congressional District. It is a very heavy ag district. It exports about $2.2 billion worth of agriculture-related products. And so as it relates to poultry and maybe specifically South Africa, I know that South Africa has been applying prohibitive antidumping duties to U.S.-origin poultry since the year 2000. Over 20 years. Another factor that has resulted in low political activity is South Africa's decision probably to raise tariff duties on our products. Of course, there are other categories of U.S. poultry that does not have access to the market. We have talked about fair market access for our products. It is important, I think, to all of us, certainly to my district. Could you talk specifically, though, about South Africa's current trade restrictions on U.S. ag products, and how do these barriers impact U.S. farmers and U.S. producers? Mr. RUNDE. So I eat a lot of bacon and I also eat a lot of chicken, so I want to thank your constituents. But I also think poor people around the world rely on cows and they rely on chickens for their protein. And so I think we should enact pro-poor agricultural policies in the Global South. So we should be supporting animal husbandry as part of supporting food security in general. As I said earlier, the Obama administration had concerns about pork and I also believe poultry back in 2015 with South Africa. So this is not a new issue that we have. This is a pain point in our relationship with South Africa. As I said earlier, the resolution of bilateral trade disputes is part of AGOA eligibility, and AGOA has the provisions that require that barriers to U.S. exports be limiting, including unjustified sanitary and phytosanitary barriers. And I think there have been concerns about avian flu, but I also understand that there has been sort of major progress in that area in the United States in terms of our poultry. So I eat it every day with no concerns, so I would hope our friends in South Africa would do the same. I do think, Congressman--I think that we should be documenting job losses for the American poultry producers as part of this holdup, and I think we should be demonstrating that. And then, finally, I would hope that the Biden administration would consider even a formal WTO--a WTO formal complaint on this issue of poultry vis-`-vis South Africa, Congressman. Mr. KUSTOFF. Thank you, Mr. Runde. If I could, maybe in a different area--I know in your testimony, you said that the United States is not going to displace China on the continent or match it with the investment dollar for dollar, but we could compete in certain sectors. So what are the sectors you think that we could be competitive in? Mr. RUNDE. So I certainly think there are certain components in the digital space where I think that is the case. I certainly don't want--as China moves into whether it is--so I think--so digital is one. I would like us also to think whether it is healthcare, whether it is pharmaceuticals. I also think manufacturing. I also think, certainly, we are very competitive in agriculture. So I do think they also--given sort of these global shifts in supply chains, we want to offer ourselves and should offer ourselves as a partner with Africa to build this next level of--they don't want to just be in the extractive business. You know, it is not the continent of 25 years ago. To the extent that we have a positive, forward-looking agenda that speaks to their hopes and aspirations in terms of their economies, we should be seen as not just--I think China is seen as an extractive partner, and we need to be seen as an additive partner, Congressman. Mr. KUSTOFF. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will yield back. Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Kustoff. I now recognize Mr. Schneider from Illinois. Mr. SCHNEIDER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the witnesses for first sharing your insights and perspective--this has been very helpful--but also your patience as we work our way through the day. I want to thank the chair and committee for calling this hearing today. Africa and Haiti are crucial to U.S. interests, and I am going to touch a little bit on each. As a member of--in fact, the only member of both the House Committee on Ways and Means and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I am proud that so much of our work is dedicated to America's global leadership around the world. I often say that the U.S. is at its best when we lead--when we lead with our friends and allies, not just looking at the bottom line, but looking at our strategic interests broadly in a way that is shared with our allies and reflecting the moral clarity of our values-based vision for the future. Of course, there is much strategically to be gained from working with African countries and allies in Africa. It is the young population in some of the world's fastest growing economies, as was noted today. But more than that, it is crucial that African countries as friends and partners to the U.S.--we recognize them as such and that we work together towards a world that is more just, fair, and sustainable. As was said earlier--my colleague Terri Sewell mentioned it. Mr. Runde, you touched on it. We need to work to reauthorize, but not just reauthorize, but to enhance and improve AGOA, and I look forward to working on this committee to doing that. I want to focus most of my--or all of my questions on Haiti. Abraham Lincoln, our greatest President--and I will note proudly a fellow Illinoian--was the first U.S. President to recognize Haiti. Since then, the relationship has been complex but always crucial, whether geopolitically or through the strong ties between the diaspora and the island. Today, Haiti is facing one of its greatest challenges since independence. We are witnessing a near collapse of the state, and I hope the Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will come to unblock the crucial funds to help restore calm. As the administration works with our allies, especially Kenya, to stabilize the situation in Haiti, we must also think about the future. We must do everything in our power to ensure that the future of Haiti is not just a recovery but includes prosperity and security and that our private sector is able, willing, and committed to investing to lift up the Haitian people. So let me ask Ms. Muhika and Mr. Runde, what can we in Congress do to best help Haiti going forward? The surge in foreign direct investment that followed HOPE I, HOPE II, and HELP in the early part of this century is something this body can and should be proud of. As Secretary Blinken recently noted, HOPE/HELP is a vital program. And as you talk, can you--well, I will leave the question there for now. Ms. MUHIKA. Thank you, Mr. Schneider. Unfortunately, I am not an expert on Haiti, but the Solidarity Center's Haiti team is happy to get back to you comprehensively in writing. Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Runde, any thoughts? Mr. RUNDE. So the best social program in the world is a job, and I would hope that we renew this year the Haiti HOPE Act. I think we have talked about making adjustments to AGOA, and so that may be a little bit more complicated. I would ask, in all humility, that the Congress coalesce around one bill. I know there is multiple bills. There is a number of folks who have they care about Haiti. The best thing we could do is coalesce around one bill, even potentially even get to unanimous consent around one bill. I think companies are leaving now. I believe it is the seventh largest source of undocumented people crossing our border, the Southern Border, are from Haiti. We are going to have more people--if we don't have jobs, we are going to have all sorts of bad things happen. Of course there needs to be a political settlement in Haiti. Of course there needs to be some sort of security arrangement. I know that there has been, you know--so it is a-- but we have to start with getting this renewed. Mr. SCHNEIDER. I hear you and one I will note, and maybe you have thoughts on this, but our colleague, Stacey Plaskett, has the HOPE for Asian Prosperity Act of 2023. Do you have any thoughts on what that could do or--well, we can bring that up in a later conversation. Mr. RUNDE. I have a opinions on a lot many things, Congressman. I don't have a view on the different--there is at least three different bills, if I understand it, sir, and maybe a fourth. All I would ask is that Congress, in its wisdom, coalesce around one bill, sir. Mr. SCHNEIDER. I hear you, I concur, and we need to do more to help Haiti in a very difficult moment. And with that, I yield back. Mr. BUCHANAN. Thank you, Mr. Schneider, I now recognize Ms. Moore from Wisconsin. Ms. MOORE. Thank you, Mr. Chair, for allowing me to wave on this subcommittee, and I want to thank the witnesses for a tremendous education here this afternoon. I have questions for all of you. So many questions, so little time, so bear with me. Ms. Muhika, I am going to ask you this question, and I may ask others it too. What in your opinion or your research has prevented really good vertical integration within the African continent to make them more productive? I mean, you got a lot of cotton there, but then they have to send the cotton off to Asia to get it processed, and I think one of our witnesses talked about the different colors--Mr. Richmond. What could AGOA do, in your opinion, to promote vertical integration? Ms. MUHIKA. Thank you for that question. Please allow us to get back to you in writing. Ms. MOORE. Okay. How about you, should I ask Mr. Richmond, Mr. Runde, who wants to volunteer? Mr. RICHMOND. Sure. I will go ahead. Thank you. Ms. MOORE. Okay. Mr. RICHMOND. It takes investment in terms of investment dollars and expertise. Right? Building that out, it is not rocket science, right, but it does take a lot of money, in terms of equipment, it takes expertise, bringing--you know, we have, I mentioned, 5,600 people working for us, so we have a hundred ex-pats that we have brought from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh and Philippines and all over, to transfer that knowledge, right? Just like China wasn't China 20, 30, 40 years ago. They had to learn, so. Ms. MOORE. So, Mr. Nasser, let me ask you, Mr. Nasser, really quick, Kenya, we are about to go to Kenya in a couple days, and I know that they are recipients of AGOA, but they may, quote/unquote, graduate. What do you think would be the consequences of them graduating at this time in their development? Mr. NASSER. Thanks for the question, Congresswoman Moore. We have a small supply chain in Kenya. It is about 5 percent of our imports. I am not sure or familiar with the specifics of a graduation program for them, so I can't comment. Ms. MOORE. You know, because people have commented--okay, Mr. Runde, come on, help us out here. Mr. RUNDE. Thank you, Congresswoman. I am a Packers fan, so it---- Ms. MOORE. All right. See, I knew that. Mr. RUNDE. That is good. So graduation, look, Congresswoman, I think it is a--would be a terrible thing for-- whether it is Mauritius and other countries in Africa, as I said earlier, AGOA was set up as a halfway house to move towards free trade agreements. I hope we can restart dialogue about a free trade agreement with Kenya. So having a country become middle income and then graduate from AGOA to nothing is a disaster. I would suggest that we keep all the countries in AGOA until such time as we have free trade--work towards free trade agreements, Congresswoman. Ms. MOORE. Okay. Now, Mr. Runde, while I have got you here, you had an interesting discourse with the gentle lady from West Virginia about minerals. And you said something, like, oh boy, people would hate going into mining. Then you went on to talk about how we need to really lean into that. Can you really clarify for me, because I am very interested in the exploitation, and I guess, you know, Ms. Muhika would agree with that, that a lot of the exploitation that occurs in this sector, and as we move into needing these critical minerals, can you clarify for me what you mean? Mr. RUNDE. Yes, Congresswoman, what I was trying to say is that we need minerals, and we are going to need a lot more minerals in the future. I believe that the American people are not going to want to transfer--you know, moving from the internal combustion engine to electric vehicles and electric batteries if they are controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. I also believe that---- Ms. MOORE. So is this a space where AGOA could skip in and---- Mr. RUNDE. I think so. I mean, I think we--what I would say is that we need to be supporting clean, fair, equitable activities in mining and minerals. We need to raise standards. There are many fine mining companies around the world, many of them U.S. companies, British companies, Australian companies. I think it is---- Ms. MOORE. And they could benefit as well? Mr. RUNDE. Yeah, absolutely, they---- Ms. MOORE. I only have 30 seconds left. I am sorry to cut you off, but I have to really ask Ms. Muhika a question again. I was on an airplane, and some woman squeezed herself into a middle seat because that is all that was left there, and I really got depressed by the time I was finished talking to her, because she works for an international environmental organization, and she says that it is--everybody in the development world knows that as soon as you go in and start helping women and empowering women and lifting women up, people in the community who are most likely to use that money to spend it on uplifting the family, that the instance you do that, domestic violence skyrockets. I was so depressed after I got off the plane, sitting next to her. Can you tell me, what, if anything, you propose in the way of programming to alleviate this outcome? Ms. MUHIKA. Thank you for that question, and I do not think I agree with that analogy, but---- Ms. MOORE. Okay. Ms. MUHIKA . We know that labor rights, or labor in general, is an intersectional issue. For example, women rights are critical to upholding labor rights. Policies that hold back women, governments that do not appoint women to leadership positions, and employers who do not maintain a safe workplace free from gender-based violence, are stifling up the advancement of labor rights in general. So my only response would be that we cannot stop supporting the advancement of women just because of a different---- Ms. MOORE. I think I saw you shaking your head or doing something, Mr. Runde. Any thoughts on that? Oh, you Mr. Richmond? Mr. RICHMOND. Sure. I mean, I will just say, I mean, again, as, you know, we employ 76 percent women. In fact, our local partner in Ghana is a Ghanaian woman. The studies I have seen show that, you know, when women bring home money, that it is more likely to go towards supporting the family and the things it should go to than otherwise. So I mean, we are big believers in providing those opportunities. Ms. MOORE. All right. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, thank you for your indulgence. Thank you for having this hearing. Thank you for letting me wave on, and I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Ms. Moore. I certainly thank you to all my colleagues. I deferred on my questions, but I certainly appreciate the participation here today. It has been robust with just about a hundred percent participation of all subcommittee members. I think it speaks to the fact that for what we need right now in the world, Africa offers many, many solutions, offers examples of what the right thing to do is, unassociated with a commercial name obviously, but I think that this opportunity gives us a chance to analyze where we have been, where we need to go. So let me just say, Mr. Runde, you have touched a bit on some concerns about South Africa. And make no mistake, they enjoy vast benefits from AGOA, and yet I think they are undermining our foreign policy--their partnership with Mr. Putin and attacking Israel through the International Court of Justice. These are concerning issues. Intellectual property protections are lacking, and let me add that they are attempting also to expropriate American IP through the TRIPS Waiver Process, again, I think, undermining our interests, even when our interests are helping the world. And so I am very, very concerned about that, and I think this is an opportunity for us to look further in modernizing how we handle AGOA moving forward. You know, there is enthusiasm to make necessary changes, to kind of lift our expectations, but I too was with the colleagues around Africa a few weeks back where we have seen great examples of what is working, whether it was in Mauritius or Benin, other places. So let's see more of that, but also let's not have our trading partners, who are doing the right thing all along the way and utilizing AGOA, and then have nowhere else to go. I mean, it is hard to even call it graduation when it is a dead end. And we owe ultimately the American people better policy through this effort, and so I would hope that we could dig and dig deeper. I hear the comments here and, I think, an appetite for a trade agreement with Kenya. I am beginning to wonder that the only people opposed to a trade agreement with Kenya happen to be at the White House. How unfortunate. Because as I engage with colleagues here in the legislative branch, there is this appetite and enthusiasm to get going here, let's get things done. And this is bipartisan, certainly on the heels of USMCA that has been bipartisan as well. So, Mr. Runde, can you perhaps examine further, you said that a complaint filed through the WTO on South Africa would be in order. Would you like to elaborate, or could you elaborate on that a bit? Mr. RUNDE. I would just say that I understand the temptation to use AGOA as a stick, but I am trying to resist the temptation. They have been a bad actor. They are undermining American policy on a number of fronts, but I do think we have had to work at our relationship with South Africa. And so as I said earlier, the Obama administration had similar concerns on certain agricultural products, and I believe they found ways to work with them. So I think we have a fabulous ambassador in Ambassador Reuben Brigety. I think he represents us very, very well. I am a great admirer of his. And so I know that he has a very difficult job there, but I do think that some of it needs to be behind closed doors. Some of it needs to be through calling attention to it through Congress, and then I think to the extent that we can use actions, whether through having a dialogue through the AGOA process but also through the WTO, I think these are all things that we ought to be looking at, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SMITH. Thank you. Now, on Kenya, do you have any numbers, by chance, in terms of what they are already benefitting from and perhaps how we could benefit more through a bilateral trade agreement that there is so much support for? Mr. RUNDE. I don't, sir. But what I will do is, I will come back to you with some brief thoughts in writing for the record. Chairman SMITH. Okay. I appreciate that. Mr. RUNDE. I will do some homework, Chairman. Chairman SMITH. I appreciate that. I know that we have been told repeatedly from the administration that they are not leading on any trade agreements because they don't have the votes. I would challenge that assertion based on the discussion we have had here today and other engagements I have had, both sides of the aisle, in terms of what we should be doing, like with Kenya. The fact is that the Trump administration teed up a trade agreement with Kenya and that the current administration is unwinding it, stepping back from it, and yet having a discussion as long as it doesn't involve tariffs. You know, certainly other colleagues have touched on other barriers, non-tariff trade barriers, again back to South Africa, but, wow, there is just so much opportunity, opportunity for, I would hope, South Africa to improve where they stand with our country right now, but that is also exactly what we need. Our challenges now with China can be resolved with building relationships. As Mr. Richmond has pointed out, there are great opportunities there. And, Mr. Richmond, anything you would like to add to previous comments? Mr. RICHMOND. Well, I mean, if you would indulge me, I would like to actually ask a very naive question. Chairman SMITH. Okay. Go ahead. Mr. RICHMOND. And that is, I have heard everybody say that they are in favor of renewal, reauthorization of AGOA, but-- but--want to take the opportunity to make improvements, and it is a--you know, it is a one-sided, right, it is a unilateral agreement, right? So I guess what I am--one of my naive questions is, what prevents you from reauthorizing it as is to give the certainty to investors and yet still work on all of the improvements you want and enacting those when you have agreed to those? So that it provided that stability but still the opportunity, like, that is the part I guess I am naive about. Chairman SMITH. Well, you raise the concerns about predictability and stability. I think that is very important, and just as a gauge, and as we have discussions and I get various points of input from colleagues and stakeholders, the urgency to renew it is very present. So I think that, you know, looking at it--there are also the expectations, though, that along with that urgency, we need to deal with some of these things such as the dead end of so- called graduation. We are going to have to deal with that. Now, that won't all be resolved, in my opinion. When we know we need a trade agreement, say, with Kenya, a bilateral trade agreement with Kenya, comprehensive, and it will take Mauritius, a great example of what we set out to accomplish, they are doing the right thing, what is next? You know, we won't resolve all of that in a renewal in my opinion, but I think that we need to really examine and put pressure on the administration, for example, to show some leadership where the executive branch is most appropriate to lead in these areas. I cannot emphasize that enough. So whether it is agriculture that we have heard about, textiles, adding value, the opportunities are many to make some corrections but also build what can be, I think, a very bright future, especially with the fastest growing continent in terms of population and just so many opportunities. So with that, again, thank you to our witnesses for joining us here today. Please be advised that members have two weeks to submit written questions to be answered later in writing. Those questions and your answers will be made part of the formal hearing record. With that, this subcommittee stands adjourned. Thank you again.
