OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BRYAN STEIL, CHAIRMAN OF THE
COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION, A U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM
WISCONSIN
Chairman Steil. The Committee on House Administration will
come to order. I note that a quorum is present.
Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare a
recess at any time.
Before we begin, I would like to recognize one of our
colleagues who is not here today, Dr. Murphy. This week, he
announced that he was diagnosed with a base-of-skull tumor.
All of us on this Committee know that Dr. Murphy is a
fighter, and I think I speak for everyone when I say we are all
keeping Dr. Murphy in our thoughts and prayers. We wish him a
speedy recovery and are looking forward to him being back on
this dais with us again soon.
Knowing Dr. Murphy, I am guessing he is probably watching
the live feed from home, and so if you are, Dr. Murphy, we look
forward to having you back.
Today, we will consider legislation to stop foreign
influence in our elections, prevent noncitizens voting, and
strengthen our election administration.
Over the past several months, this Committee has examined
different pieces of legislation that would increase confidence
in our elections. When Americans are more confident that their
elections are secure, they are more likely to participate. As
Chairman of the Committee, my focus has been on increasing
confidence and participation in our elections.
Last week, we held a hearing focused on noncitizen voting
and foreign influence in our elections. Witnesses discussed the
difficulties the National Voter Registration Act can place on
States and the challenges States have of maintaining clean
voter rolls.
We have also demonstrated how foreign nationals are trying
to influence our elections here in the United States. Federal
law prohibits foreign nationals from contributing to campaigns,
yet we continue to see foreign nationals use loopholes to get
around this.
We will consider legislation today to address this issue.
My legislation, the Preventing Foreign Interference in American
Elections Act, would close the loophole and strengthen donor
privacy protections.
We will also consider legislation to help States clean
their voter rolls and prevent noncitizens from voting.
Noncitizen voting in our elections must be stopped.
You may hear my colleagues on the left say noncitizen
voting in Federal elections is already illegal. As we discussed
in last week's hearing, there have been noncitizens registered
to vote in Ohio, in Virginia, in Pennsylvania.
Here in our Nation's capital, the D.C. City Council passed
legislation to allow noncitizens to vote in municipal
elections, and noncitizens will be voting this fall. The D.C.
Board of Elections recently confirmed that nearly 500
noncitizens have registered to vote in our Nation's capital,
and that number is only growing. Early voting for D.C.'s
primary election is happening right now, and, as we sit here
today, noncitizens are voting to elect members of the D.C. City
Council. That is absurd.
We must do two things: One, we cannot allow the D.C.
citizens voting law to spread across the United States. Two, we
need to ensure noncitizens are not voting in Federal elections
across the United States. While it is illegal today for
noncitizens to vote in our Federal elections, it is also
illegal to evade Border Patrol and unlawfully enter the
country, and, as we have seen, that has not stopped anyone. We
must end noncitizen voting now.
It is critical that we provide States the tools they need
to verify citizenship for individuals registering to vote. As
we discussed last week in this Committee, it is difficult for
States to maintain clean voter rolls. Last week, we found in
Ohio 137 noncitizens were on the voter rolls. In May 2023,
Virginia removed 1,481 noncitizens from their voter rolls.
Across the country, Democrat jurisdictions are allowing
noncitizens to vote in their elections. This will continue to
create challenges for States to maintain clean voter rolls
unless we stop noncitizen voting.
The Constitution and Federal law only protects the rights
of citizens of the United States to vote in U.S. elections.
That is why only U.S. citizens should be voting in U.S.
elections.
I look forward to a thoughtful discussion on the
legislation before us today, and I yield back.
I will now recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Morelle, for 5
minutes for the purpose of offering his opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOSEPH MORELLE, RANKING MEMBER OF THE
COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION, A U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM
NEW YORK
Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
First and most importantly, let me join with you in wishing
our friend and colleague, Dr. Murphy, a full and speedy
recovery. We are keeping him and his family very much in our
prayers. Best to him.
As it relates to the hearing that we held last week--which,
in my view, was not only a waste of this Committee's time but a
waste of the taxpayer resources that this Committee has
expended to disseminate the disproven lies to actively
undermine American faith in our democracy.
I appreciate my colleague who talks about confidence in
American elections and the importance of Americans having
confidence. Unfortunately, everything this Committee has sought
to do, everything the former President seeks to do, is
undermine that very faith.
I know that every one of my majority colleagues understands
that this narrative will aggravate the perilous infection of
election denialism that is spreading in the American civic
body, and the rest of us know it too.
Just a point about last week's hearing. The Associated
Press, in an article that ran in the Wisconsin State Journal
this past Tuesday, said, and I quote, ``Republicans who have
been vocal about voting by those who are not citizens have
demurred when asked for evidence that it is a problem.''
USA Today, one of the largest circulations in the country--
so, many Americans are reading USA Today--said that the SAVE
Act is the same, quote, `` `rigged election' disinformation
that Trump has been hawking for almost 8 years.''
The Washington Post said that Republicans, quote, ``feel
compelled to construct a boogeyman to toe Trump's line on
combating voter fraud--even as they freely acknowledge they
cannot say what the boogeyman is made of,'' end quote.
The deluge of articles published in the last 2 weeks alone
shows what a transparent game people are playing. The American
people see through this as well.
Election denialism was unpopular in 2020. It was equally
unpopular, if not more so, in 2022. It will be unpopular this
November.
Just as the Speaker's trip paying homage at Mar-a-Lago
tarnished our American tradition of democracy, just as the
Speaker's conspiracy-fueled press conference on the steps of
this Capitol fanned the flames of extremism, and just as our
hearing energized efforts to undermine American confidence in
elections, this markup today is the latest blemish on the
majority's anti-democracy quest.
We have been here before. Former President Trump is leading
this party and, strikingly, leading this very Committee down a
terribly dangerous and un-American path.
This is a man who yearns for, according to his own campaign
materials, a ``unified Reich'' in this country. This is the man
you have chained your electoral prospects, to say nothing of
your moral leadership and historic legacies, to. Aren't you
embarrassed? I, for one, am embarrassed for you.
Today's markup of the SAVE Act is a repugnant use of our
time. Committee Democrats have grave concern about each of the
bills, and we will offer several amendments in an effort to
make these bills better or, at the very least, to offer
Americans an alternative vision of democracy, one based in
fairness, in justice, not based on fear, cynicism, and doubt.
Our vision of democracy is based on a Constitution that has
moved ever forward from our founding, expanding its wings of
equality and enfranchisement to formerly enslaved people, to
women, to Native people, to young people.
That is the story of this Nation--one of a democracy that
grows more inclusive, that ensures that the voices of every
American can be heard by those of us who have been entrusted to
walk the halls of Congress.
The SAVE Act is the opposite of that. It is contrary to the
American story that has been told for 247 years and, God
willing, will be told for countless years to come.
This is the fundamental difference between our parties
today. The Democrats on this Committee will not stop fighting
for the rule of law, for the peaceful transfer of power, and
for the very survival of this Republic.
What Committee Democrats will not do is subvert American
faith in elections in an effort to supplicate to a proven con
man. We will leave that to our Republican colleagues.
With that, I yield back.

Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back.
Without objection, the opening statements of all other
Members will be included in the record.
Chairman Steil. As required by House rules, a substantive
copy of the measures to be considered today have been made
available to Members and the public at least 24 hours in
advance.
I now call up H.R. 8399, the Preventing Foreign
Interference in American Elections Act.
As I mentioned in my opening remarks, this legislation
would close the loopholes foreign nationals can use to donate
to campaigns.
Today, under current law, foreign nationals can pay for
activities like voter registration, ballot harvesting, and get-
out-the-vote activities. In recent years, we have seen the
impact that ``Zuckerbucks'' have had in reducing confidence in
elections administration.
Our hearing last week demonstrated that foreign nationals
are using nonprofits as a pass-through to contribute to
campaigns, often Democratic super-PACs.
When we had the Federal Elections Commission before our
Committee, both Democrat and Republican commissioners agreed
that we must close this loophole.
Congress must close the loophole. We must pass this bill in
order to do so.
I will now recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Morelle, if he
would like to give a statement on the bill.
Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would.
I fervently believe Congress has a duty to stem the tide of
foreign money in our elections.
For this reason, I have been proud to advocate for the
passage of the Freedom to Vote Act (FTVA), which contains
several provisions aimed at stemming this tide, including the
DISCLOSE Act and the Honest Ads Act.
I was also happy to support the majority's efforts last
Congress to advance a bipartisan recommendation of the FEC
related to foreign money in ballot initiatives.
This bill seems incongruous, however, with that critical
duty. This bill does absolutely nothing to get foreign money
out of our politics.
On the one hand, the measure suggests it is important to
ensure that foreign money does not influence American
elections. Fine. On the other hand, however, several provisions
of this bill make it more likely that foreign donors would be
able to fund election activities in the United States by
hampering disclosure and the FEC's law enforcement capacity.
We know this to be true: Americans are frustrated by a
campaign finance system that seems to be stacked in favor of
special interests and dark-money donors. We know that robust
transparency is the best way to reassure the American people
that their political system works for them. As Justice Louis
Brandeis famously stated, ``Sunlight is the best
disinfectant.''
Why in the world would this Committee's majority propose
legislation that undermines transparency, inviting even more
undisclosed, dark, likely foreign money to infiltrate our
political system, as this bill as drafted would do?
Why in the world would the majority hamstring law
enforcement's ability to ensure the rule of law, to see to it
that our Federal campaign finance laws are fairly enforced, as
this bill as drafted would do?
If there are drafting errors--and I hope there are--I would
ask the chair to reconsider bringing this bill to a vote today.
I recognize the bill includes some exemptions for the donor
shielding provisions. The exceptions, however, do not salvage
the bill. Instead, they gloss over systemic issues that need to
be solved.
In 2017, the Trump administration reversed a years-long
rule requiring certain 501(c) organizations to report major
donors to the IRS. Since then, the dark-money ecosystem has
hobbled the IRS. Moreover, millions in dark money goes
unreported to the FEC due to loopholes unsolved by this
measure.
Finally, a dysfunctional FEC has ceased all meaningful
enforcement of existing laws. Indeed, the FEC has informed this
Committee that it had acted on barely half of the nonpartisan
staff's recommended foreign-interference investigations,
including none that involved Mr. Trump, his campaign, or his
associates.
In matters requiring dark-money groups to register a report
with the FEC, the FEC acted on only five of nonpartisan career
staff's two dozen recommendations.
I want to be clear: I would be eager to work in tandem with
you to find common ground and common accord to fulfill our
important duty, and I would be happy to work with you to find
bipartisan consensus here.
In that vein, I will propose several amendments today to
ensure that we are able to comprehensively stop foreign money
infiltrating our elections. I hope my colleagues join me in
supporting them.
If, however, the bill is designed to further open the
floodgates to undisclosed foreign donations, to kneecap the FEC
and other law enforcement agencies, then we will strenuously
oppose.
Mr. Chair, you can tell me whether we work together to
limit foreign money or whether the majority intentionally
drafted this measure in such a way to make it even easier for
foreign donors to hide the sources of their contributions.
With that, I yield back.
Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back.
The clerk will please report the bill.
The Clerk. H.R. 8399----
Chairman Steil. Without objection, the first reading of the
bill is dispensed with.


Chairman Steil. Also, without objection, the bill should be
considered as read and open to amendment at any point.
I have an Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute at the
desk. The clerk will please report the amendment.
The Clerk. Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute----
Chairman Steil. Without objection, the Amendment in the
Nature of a Substitute is considered as read and will be
considered as original text for the purpose of further
amendment.
[The Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute to H.R. 8399
follows:]

Chairman Steil. The question now occurs on adopting the
Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute.
All those in favor, signify by saying aye----

Chairman Steil. Considered as original text for purpose of
further amendment.
The question now occurs on adopting the Amendment in the
Nature of a Substitute.
All those in favor, signify by saying aye.
All those opposed, no.
In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it, and the AINS
is now considered as original text for purposes of further
amendment.
Mr. Morelle. I have an amendment.
Chairman Steil. The gentleman has an amendment at the desk.
The clerk will please report.
The clerk will please report the amendment.
The Clerk. Amendment----
Chairman Steil. Without objection, further reading of the
amendment will be dispensed with.
[The first amendment to H.R. 8399 of Ranking Member Morelle
follows:]

Ms. Lee. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order.
Chairman Steil. The gentlewoman from Florida reserves a
point of order.
Mr. Morelle is recognized for 5 minutes in support of the
amendment.
Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
This amendment, which is the DISCLOSE Act, is about making
sure that the American people have transparency around the
foreign and big money spenders that have such a significant
impact on our electoral system. Voters should be able to follow
the money.
Critically, Congress should close loopholes allowing
spending by foreign nationals in domestic elections.
For example, in 2021, the Federal Election Commission, the
independent Federal agency charged with protecting the
integrity of the Federal campaign finance process, found reason
to believe and conciliated a matter where an experienced
political consultant knowingly and willfully violated Federal
law.
The consultant had solicited a contribution from a foreign
national by offering to transmit a $2 million contribution to a
super-PAC through his company and two 501(c)(4) organizations
to conceal the origin of the funds.
This scheme was only unveiled after a news article reported
the solicitation. The same political consultant was later
convicted of a near-identical scheme involving a Russian
national.
Congress must do more to stem the tide of foreign money
seeking to influence our elections. The DISCLOSE Act clarifies
the scope of the foreign-nationals ban and incorporates the
bipartisan FEC recommendation to capture ballot initiatives,
among other reforms.
The DISCLOSE Act also addresses the problem of money that
is laundered through various front groups or shell entities to
hide the original source of campaign-related spending.
The Supreme Court has repeatedly endorsed disclosure,
because it helps voters hold elected leaders accountable.
This is a commonsense amendment that would increase
transparency in American democracy and stop foreign
interference--something that should have bipartisan support. I
urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
Thank you.
Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back.
Does any other Member seek recognition?
The question is on the amendment.
All those in favor, signify by saying aye.
All those opposed, no.
In the opinion of the chair, the noes have it.
Mr. Morelle. Mr. Chairman, I would ask for a recorded vote.
Chairman Steil. A recorded vote has been requested. A roll
call vote is requested. The clerk will please call the roll.

The Clerk. Amendment to H.R. 8399, offered by Mr. Morelle--
--
Chairman Steil. Without objection, further reading of the
amendment will be dispensed with.
[The second amendment to H.R. 8399 of Ranking Member
Morelle follows:]

Ms. Lee. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order.
Chairman Steil. The gentlewoman reserves a point of order.
For point of clarification, the previous point of order was
waived, unanimous consent. Thank you very much.
Mr. Morelle is now recognized for 5 minutes in support of
the amendment.
Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
This amendment would add a prohibition to this bill to
prevent foreign donors from promoting, supporting, attacking,
or opposing the nomination of Senate confirmation of an
individual who is under consideration for a Federal judgeship.
At a time when Americans are rightfully concerned about
malign donor influence in the Federal judiciary, including on
the U.S. Supreme Court, this amendment will reassure Americans
that foreign donors will not be able to influence our courts.
Several high-profile investigations have in recent months
revealed deeply concerning relationships between Supreme Court
Justices and Republican mega-donors.
Indeed, whether it has been the brazen financial dealings
between Clarence Thomas and billionaire Harlan Crow or Justice
Samuel Alito's astonishingly bad judgment in flying an upside-
down American flag, a discredited symbol of extremism and
election denialism, outside of his home in the days following
the January 6th attack on this Capitol, the American people are
in disbelief about the State of our judiciary.
Just last night, public reporting confirmed that Justice
Alito has been flying another flag associated with Donald
Trump's attempt to steal the 2020 election, the ``appeal to
heaven'' flag, outside of his vacation home. This was a flag
that rioters carried as they stormed the United States Capitol
on January 6th.
Polls have shown that these ethical lapses have deeply hurt
Americans' faith in the fairness of our judiciary. Americans
should not have to worry that foreign donors, in addition to
extremists and conservative activists, are influence-peddling
on our Nation's highest court.
This amendment should have bipartisan support. I urge my
colleagues to vote yes.
I also ask unanimous consent to enter into the record this
picture of the upside-down American flag, the symbol of ``stop
the steal'' extremism, and the insurrectionists' ``appeal to
heaven'' flag, both of which flew outside the homes of Justice
Samuel Alito.
Thank you. I yield back.
Mr. Griffith. Mr. Chairman, I object.
Chairman Steil. The gentleman objects on?
Mr. Griffith. The gentleman asked for unanimous consent. If
the amendment were to pass, it might make sense, but if the
amendment does not pass, why would we insert into the record on
this bill, your bill, something that is totally irrelevant to
your bill? Unless the amendment passes, in which case I will
withdraw my objection.
Mr. Morelle. Well, I would just strongly urge--the items I
have asked to be entered into the record are germane to the
amendment which is being considered in front of this House. I
have never, in my 6 years here in Congress, ever heard anyone
object to a unanimous consent on filing something as part of
the record.
Mr. Griffith. All right. I withdraw my objection. I think
it is totally superfluous to the debate we are supposed to be
having.
Chairman Steil. The gentleman withdraws his objection.
Without objection, entered into the record.


Chairman Steil. Does the gentleman yield back?
Mr. Morelle. Yes, sir.
Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back.
I would now recognize myself for 5 minutes to strike the
last word.
I think there is grounds that we could definitely look, in
particular, as it relates to the confirmation process and
foreign money and foreign interference. Would love to work with
my colleague on that.
The underlying legislation we have before us is focused in
on elections. I will not go through a germane process and
remove the bill on germane; I am happy to vote it up or down. I
think, at its core, it is not germane in the sense of what we
are trying to go after here in the underlying legislation,
which is to remove foreign interference in U.S. elections.
I think it is a worthy conversation to have that the
gentleman brings up as it relates to Senate confirmations and
any potential foreign interference in that space, and I would
enjoy having a dialogue and work with my colleague to find
common ground in that space. It is just not the purpose of the
underlying legislation, which is to address foreign
interference in U.S. elections.
Further, this amendment, as the previous amendment, strikes
key donor privacy protections that I think are absolutely
essential to maintain our First Amendment rights and to
maintain the integrity of the broader electoral system.
I encourage my colleagues to not support this bill.
I will yield back.
Does the gentlewoman from Florida seek recognition? For
what purpose?
Ms. Lee. I do, Mr. Chairman. Just to note as follows, that
the discussion we are having----
Chairman Steil. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes
to strike the last word.
Ms. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
--that we are discussing at this time preventing foreign
interference in elections, and I take exception to the comments
directed at two of the Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court and
would simply note that there is zero evidence to suggest that
there is either an actual or even the appearance of any
impropriety on the part of those Justices or any influence on
the part of foreign actors on those Justices and their work at
the Supreme Court.
With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Chairman Steil. The gentlewoman yields back.
Does any other Member seek recognition?
Seeing none, does the gentlewoman from Florida insist on
her point of order?
Ms. Lee. I do not, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
Chairman Steil. If no other questions on the amendment by
the gentleman from New York, all those in favor, signify by
saying aye.
All those opposed, signify by saying no.
In the opinion of the chair, the noes have it, and the
amendment is not agreed to.
Mr. Morelle. I would ask for a recorded vote, Mr. Chair.
Chairman Steil. A recorded vote has been requested. The
clerk will please call the roll.
The Clerk. Chairman Steil?
Chairman Steil. No.
The Clerk. Chairman Steil votes no.

Mr. Kilmer?

The Clerk. Mrs. Torres?

The Clerk. Chairman Steil, for this vote, there are two
ayes and five noes.
Chairman Steil. The amendment is not agreed to.
Does any other Member seek recognition?
Mr. Morelle. Yes, Mr. Chair. I have one last amendment at
the desk.
Chairman Steil. The gentleman has an amendment at the desk.
The clerk will please distribute the amendment.
The clerk will report the amendment.
The Clerk. Amendment to H.R. 8399----
Chairman Steil. Without objection, further reading of the
amendment is dispensed with.
[The third amendment to H.R. 8399 of Ranking Member Morelle
follows:]

Ms. Lee. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order.
Chairman Steil. The gentlewoman from Florida, with a
working microphone, reserves a point of order.
The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes in
support of his amendment.
Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
As I mentioned previously, I had hoped that we could keep
working together on this bill because Democrats would like to
prevent the spread of foreign money in our elections.
This bill, as drafted, would do the opposite. It would
allow undisclosed foreign donations to inundate our politics.
It would also prevent the FEC from investigating potential
campaign finance violations, further weakening our ability to
keep foreign money out of our politics.
This amendment would strike the sections of the bill that
would allow foreign donors to contribute undisclosed amounts to
political campaigns but would leave in place the prohibitions
that I believe have bipartisan support and I would like to see
passed.
I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and allow us
all to support the underlying bill.
With that, I yield back.
Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back.
I recognize myself for 5 minutes to strike the last word.
The gentleman's amendment strikes key donor privacy
protections. Again, as my comments on the previous two
amendments, I maintain concerns about striking these essential
donor privacy protections.
I am going to encourage my colleagues to vote ``no.''
I yield back.
Does any other Member seek recognition?
Does the gentlewoman from Florida maintain her point of
order?
Ms. Lee. No, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
Chairman Steil. There being no further debate on the
amendment, the question is on the amendment by the gentleman
from New York.
All those in favor, signify by saying aye.
Those opposed, say no.
In the opinion of the chair, the noes have it, and the
amendment is not agreed to.
Mr. Morelle. I would like to ask for a recorded vote.
Chairman Steil. A roll call vote is requested. The clerk
will please call the roll.
The Clerk. Chairman Steil?
Chairman Steil. No.
The Clerk. Chairman Steil votes no.

The Clerk. Mrs. Torres?

The Clerk. Mr. Chairman, for this vote, there is one aye
and five noes.
Chairman Steil. The amendment is not agreed to.
Does any other Member seek recognition?
If no, per our conversation on the side to go back to the
AINS just for clarification, without objection, the Amendment
in the Nature of the Substitute will be voted on.
The question now occurs on adopting the Amendment in the
Nature of a Substitute.
All those in favor, signify by saying aye.
All those opposed, no.
In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it, and the AINS
is adopted.
Mr. Morelle. I would ask for a recorded vote, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Steil. The gentleman requests a recorded vote. The
clerk will please call the roll.
The Clerk. Chairman Steil?
Chairman Steil. Yes.
The Clerk. Chairman Steil votes yes.

The Clerk. Mrs. Torres?

The Clerk. Mr. Chairman, for this vote, there are five ayes
and one no.
Chairman Steil. The Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute
is agreed to.
The question now occurs on ordering H.R. 8399, as amended,
reported favorably to the House.
Mr. Morelle. Mr. Chair, is a quorum present?
Chairman Steil. A quorum is present.
Mr. Morelle. For the purpose of recording a vote?
Chairman Steil. It would be whether or not the roll call
has a sufficient number. I know one of our Members--one is just
outside the room, and the other is maybe 5 feet further, who
will be here in time for the roll call.
At the time of the--a quorum is present. The question I
think that the gentleman might be asking is whether or not
there is a sufficient number to report favorably to the House.
Mr. Morelle. Yes.
Chairman Steil. I am of the view that there will be a
sufficient number.
Mr. Morelle. OK.
Chairman Steil. With that, the clerk will please call the
roll.
The Clerk. Chairman Steil?
Chairman Steil. Aye.

Mrs. Bice. Yes.
Chairman Steil. Have all Members voted?
Does any Member wish to change their vote?
The clerk will please report the tally.
The Clerk. Mr. Chairman, for this vote, there are six ayes
and one no.
Chairman Steil. The amendment is agreed to and will be
reported to the House floor favorably.
Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid upon
the table.
I now call up H.R. 8281, the Safeguard American Voter
Eligibility Act.
Today in our Nation's capital, noncitizens are eligible to
vote in municipal elections. Later today, we will vote on the
House floor to overturn D.C.'s noncitizen voting scheme.
In this Committee, we are working to ensure elections
across the U.S. are for American citizens only, which this
legislation will accomplish. This bill ensures noncitizens
cannot vote in Federal elections and provides States with the
tools they need to maintain clean and accurate voter rolls.
In our hearing last week, Mr. Hans von Spakovsky outlined a
past example of noncitizens voting in Federal elections in
California's 46th House District in 1996. Congress studied
whether or not noncitizens actually voted in the elections and
found proof that noncitizens did, in fact, cast ballots. The
margin of victory in that case was 1,000 votes, and the report
found clear and convincing evidence that 624 documented aliens
had registered and voted in the election. If the bill we are
considering today had been law in 1996, this would not have
happened.
As we all know, it is not uncommon for the House to have
close races. In 2020, our colleague Mariannette Miller-Meeks
won by just six votes.
It is critical that we are preventing noncitizens from
voting in upcoming elections. That is what we are here to do
today. In Ohio, they recently found 137 noncitizens on their
voter rolls.
We want to ensure States have the tools they need to run
secure elections, and we want to ensure only American citizens
are voting in U.S. elections.
I look forward to a thoughtful discussion on this
legislation.
I will recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Morelle, if you
would like to give an opening statement on the bill.
Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
My colleagues like to say their goal on the Republican side
is to make it easy to vote, hard to cheat. I agree with that
goal. That is why I am going to continue to support advancing
legislation like the Freedom to Vote Act that would do just
that.
During a hearing last week on this measure, in my opening
remarks, I expressed my sincere concern with the SAVE Act. This
bill is unreasonably restrictive. The bill would create extreme
documentary requirements nationwide, making it much, much, much
harder to vote, burdening every potential voter and
particularly affecting people who have difficulty obtaining the
required documents, including married women who have changed
their names, students on a college campus, the elderly, lower-
income people, members of Tribal nations, naturalized citizens,
and, yes, even Republicans.
I do not know if my Republican colleagues even realize how
restrictive this is. Most Americans would be unable to register
to vote with just their driver's license, which is the way I
did it when I registered to vote many, many years ago.
How many Americans are prepared to bring their birth
certificates to the election office just to cast a rightful
ballot? Or bring their passports? How many members of our Armed
Forces are prepared to bring their military service records,
with place of birth identified?
Not only are the bill's requirements extreme, the SAVE Act
would impose severe criminal penalties on election
administrators for simple, good-faith mistakes.
We know this bill is not a serious legislative exercise. It
is a vehicle to undermine American confidence in elections. If
it were ever to become law, its provisions are so draconian
that it would surely disenfranchise millions of eligible
Americans.
This bill is a solution in search of a problem. The law is
already clear. It is unlawful for noncitizens to register to
vote. It is unlawful and a felony for individuals who are not
U.S. citizens to vote in Federal elections.
Worst yet, the bill is the latest step by House Republicans
to preemptively cover Donald Trump's lies, both past and
future.
Here, we thought the Republicans were only focused on
restricting women's private personal healthcare decisions. They
continue to support Donald Trump, a man who appointed the
Supreme Court majority that destroyed women's right to choose.
Just yesterday, former President Trump indicated he would
restrict women's access to contraception.
Just as Republicans seek to restrict women's access to
abortion, they now want to seek and restrict Americans' access
to the ballot.
This is a deeply un-democratic bill. It is indicative of a
cynical outlook the Republican Party has on American democracy
and the contempt with which they hold American voters.
With that, I yield back.
Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back.
The clerk will please report the bill.
The Clerk. H.R. 8281----
Chairman Steil. Without objection, the first reading of the
bill is dispensed with.


Chairman Steil. Also, without objection, the bill may be
considered as read and open to amendment at any point.
I have an Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute at the
desk. The clerk will please report the amendment.
The Clerk. Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute to H.R.
8281----
Chairman Steil. Without objection, the Amendment in the
Nature of a Substitute is considered as read and will be
considered as original text for purposes of further amendment.
[The Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute to H.R. 8281
follows:]

Chairman Steil. Does any Member wish to seek recognition?
Mr. Morelle. I have an amendment at the desk, sir.
Chairman Steil. The gentleman from New York has an
amendment at the desk. The clerk will please distribute.
The clerk will please report the amendment.
The Clerk. Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute to
H.R.----
Chairman Steil. Without objection, further reading of the
amendment is dispensed with.
[The amendment to H.R. 8281 of Ranking Member Morelle
follows:]

Chairman Steil. Does the gentlewoman from Florida seek a
point of order?
Ms. Lee. Yes, Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order.
Chairman Steil. The gentlewoman from Florida reserves a
point of order.
The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I have explained repeatedly how damaging I believe the
underlying bill before the Committee will be and how damaging
the conspiracy theories are that Republicans use that underpin
the legislation and continue to repeat.
It is important for the American people to understand the
divergent paths the two parties are offering, because you could
not have more opposing views of American democracy.
The Republican SAVE Act, cloaked in lies about nonexistent
noncitizen voting, would disenfranchise millions of eligible
American voters.
The bill would prevent Americans from voting simply because
they do not have or cannot afford or do not need a passport or
do not have access to their birth certificate or have trouble
overcoming the various other documentary hurdles this bill
seeks to impose.
In place of this odious bill, Democrats offer as an
amendment the relevant portions of the Freedom to Vote Act, the
most pro-democracy legislation since the Voting Rights Act of
1965.
For my colleagues on the other side, we figured we would
save you some work. We have had the Legislative Counsel's
Office scrub the amendment of all the Freedom to Vote Act
provisions that are not germane to the underlying bill. We
thought we would save you some homework.
Where the SAVE Act would block American access to the
ballot, the FTVA would expand automatic voter registration and
same-day registration.
Where the SAVE Act would create massive hurdles, the
Freedom to Vote Act will set a national standard for no-excuse
vote-by-mail for every eligible voter, as is done in many, many
States across this country and has been done without complaint
and without objection for decades.
Where the SAVE Act would prevent millions of Americans from
registering to vote at all, the Freedom to Vote Act will
protect the integrity of our voter registration lists by
prohibiting unlawful and faulty voter purges.
The SAVE Act would make it harder to vote. The Freedom to
Vote Act will expand early voting by requiring States to offer
early voting at least 2 weeks prior to election day.
The SAVE Act does nothing to ease access to the ballot for
people who may need additional assistance. The Freedom to Vote
Act will protect access to the ballot for individuals with
different physical abilities.
Unlike the SAVE Act, the Freedom to Vote Act will make
election day a national holiday.
The SAVE Act does nothing to root out real, proven foreign
interference in politics. The Freedom to Vote Act will prevent
enemies, foreign and domestic, from subverting the will of
voters by restricting the politicized removal of election
officials and cracking down on foreign influence in our
politics.
The SAVE Act does nothing to address the crisis of
intimidation against election workers. The Freedom to Vote Act
will crack down on the violence and threats against election
workers and officials, who remain in constant danger since the
former President and his allies targeted several public
servants with threats and harassment.
The SAVE Act ignores the power of special-interest donors
over our political system. The Freedom to Vote Act will end the
flood of dark money in American elections, amplifying the
voices of everyday Americans and shifting power away from the
Republican-aligned billionaires and corporate interests that
spend endless money on our political campaigns.
What do my colleagues on the other side of the aisle offer
in this bill? Lies meant to undermine American confidence in
elections.
American democracy is in peril. Only the Freedom to Vote
Act will defend our Republic against those who actively seek to
undermine our election integrity. For the sake of our
democracy, for the sake of our Republic, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment.
With that, I yield back.
Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back.
I recognize myself for 5 minutes to strike the last word.
I am not sure if, in incredible speed, my colleague struck
the nongermane aspects following my comments on the germaneness
of a previous amendment at this markup, but I do appreciate the
effort to strike out the nongermane aspects of your so-called
Freedom to Vote Act, which really stands in contrast to the
underlying legislation that we are doing.
We are working to increase the integrity of our elections,
block noncitizens from voting in our elections. Your bill, as
pushed by Democrats time and again, really does the opposite.
I would encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this. It
strikes the core concept of our legislation, which is to
prevent noncitizens from voting, increasing and enhancing the
integrity of our elections. The legislation and the amendment
put before us moves us in the opposite direction, decreasing
Americans' confidence in our elections.
We have seen time and again, as we took this Committee to
Georgia, introducing the ACE Act, and we explored in particular
Georgia's election integrity legislation, exactly the opposite
of what President Biden claimed would occur.
Many of those in the media and those on the left who went
hook, line, and sinker along with the President's misleading
and false statements said, well, we actually looked, when we
explored the empirical data, is actually people participated in
record numbers in Georgia, and people were actually, across the
board, pleased with the elections, which is a good thing.
When we saw the University of Georgia study set forth that,
following the Georgia election, following the Georgia election
integrity law being passed, overwhelming support in all--
including all key demographic groups. In particular, Blacks in
Georgia had overwhelming support for the legislation. That is a
positive thing. What we saw was significant voter participation
in Georgia--again, a very positive thing.
I think what we see at its core is, when we pass good,
solid voter integrity legislation, Americans have more
confidence in the elections, participate, and we have stronger
elections.
I think this amendment goes in the opposite direction. It
strikes the core provisions of our legislation. Not only that,
it actually weakens voter integrity provisions that are
essential for States to be building confidence in our elections
to garner more people to participate.
I encourage my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
I yield back.
Is there any further debate on the amendment?
If no, the question--does the gentlewoman from Florida
maintain her point of order?
Ms. Lee. No, Mr. Chairman. I will waive it and yield back.
Chairman Steil. The gentlewoman waives her point of order.
The question is now on the amendment by the gentleman from
New York.
All those in favor, signify by saying aye.
All those opposed, no.
In the opinion of the chair, the noes have it, and the
amendment is not agreed to.

Chairman Steil. The gentlewoman from Florida is recognized
for 5 minutes in support of the amendment.
Ms. Lee. Mr. Chairman, our Committee Members and staff have
been hard at work making improvements to further strengthen the
SAVE Act.
My amendment to your AINS makes a few technical and
conforming changes that the bill's sponsor has presented.
I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Steil. The gentlewoman yields back.
Is there further debate on the amendment?
Mr. Morelle. Sorry, Mr. Chair----
Chairman Steil. Does the gentleman seek recognition to
strike the last word?
Mr. Morelle. I would like to seek recognition to strike the
last word.
Chairman Steil. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. Morelle. Yes, thank you.
I only, obviously, had just a few seconds to look at it,
but I fear that nothing in this bill, in my mind, can make it
any better, so I would urge defeat of the amendment, defeat of
the underlying bill.
With that, I yield back.
Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back.
Is there further debate on the bill?
Seeing none, does the gentleman maintain his point of
order?
Mr. Morelle. No.
Chairman Steil. The gentleman removes his point of order.
