REFORMING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE TO SUPPORT AMERICAN WORKERS AND BUSINESSES ---------- TUESDAY, JUNE 4, 2024 House of Representatives, Subcommittee on Work and Welfare, Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC. The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 1:59 p.m. in Room 2020, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Darin LaHood  presiding. Chairman LaHOOD. Well, good afternoon, everybody. I want to welcome everybody to our Subcommittee on Work and Welfare for our hearing today on reforming unemployment insurance to support American workers and businesses. And I am grateful for the witnesses for your time and the effort you took to be here today, and for our conversation and dialogue that we will have for this hearing. I especially want to thank the committee members that are here today for this important subject. My name is Darin LaHood, and I represent Illinois's 16th district, covering much of the central and northern part of Illinois. For the purposes of today's hearing we want to learn how Congress can help rebuild and restore confidence in the unemployment insurance program after the turmoil of identity theft, fraud, and claim delays during the pandemic. GAO has estimated that between $100 and $135 billion was lost from COVID-era UI programs to fraudsters and criminals, foreign and domestic, deploying sophisticated schemes to divert benefits from unemployed workers. My home state of Illinois lost approximately $3.2 billion to fraud. This is outright theft of valuable taxpayer dollars that were not delivered to workers who needed them the most. And while COVID programs have since expired, this data exposes a number of program weaknesses that need to be addressed. In February 2023 the Ways and Means Committee held a hearing with witnesses from the Department of Labor, Inspector General's Office, GAO, and the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee. These oversight agencies testified to problems with outdated state systems and weak online security that made the UI program particularly vulnerable to fraud. Last year this committee passed the Protecting Taxpayers and Victims of Unemployment Fraud Act, which includes steps to strengthen program integrity, recover lost funds, and prevent future fraud. The House has since passed this legislation on a bipartisan basis. We know fraudsters are still attacking UI and other Federal benefit programs, and we need to build on these efforts moving forward. This hearing will investigate three main areas of reform. Number one, supporting state program integrity improvements and technology modernization, which are vital to this process. We will explore ways to prevent fraud by verifying identity of UI recipients and moving away from the ``pay and chase'' model of benefit delivery. Second, we must focus on reemployment. The purpose of UI is to provide a bridge between jobs. However, many workers end up exhausting their benefits and remain out of the labor force. According to the Department of Labor, 38 percent of UI claimants exhausted their benefits in the first quarter of 2024. We know the longer a worker remains out of the labor force, the harder it is to return to work. That is why I have co-led, along with Ranking Member Danny Davis, to my left, the BRIDGE for Workers Act, to strengthen the Reemployment Services to Eligibility Assessments program. Our bill would offer more flexibility to states to provide job skills training, resume preparation, and career exploration to connect unemployed workers to in-demand jobs more quickly. We passed this bill unanimously out of committee last November, and I look forward to its consideration on the House floor very soon. Third, to improve program administration, we will examine the administrative funding model for state UI programs which collects but does not distribute adequate resources to states. The Federal Unemployment Tax, pronounced FUTA, provides a dedicated revenue stream to support state administration of the UI program. However, these dollars are not ending up in state agency hands to enact needed system improvements. In fiscal year 2022 states received approximately $3.7 billion less in administrative funding than employers collectively paid in FUTA taxes due to problems with how dollars flow through the Unemployment Trust Fund. This process also creates disparities in how funding is allocated across the country. As part of making the UI program more resilient, reforms are needed to improve this financing mechanism so states are able to invest in long-term solutions. Lastly, I would like to recognize my colleagues Representative Carey, Representative Steel, and Representative Tenney for their recent introduction of legislation to modernize UI and support workers and small businesses. These bills are important building blocks for us to work on reforming this critical program for American workers. Again, I am grateful for the witnesses before us today. I want to thank you for being here today, and we look forward to your testimony. Chairman LaHOOD. With that, I am pleased to now recognize the gentleman from Illinois, our ranking member, Mr. Davis. Mr. DAVIS. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And before I begin my statement, I want to thank you for the hearing and thank the witnesses for coming. But I want to convey all of our best wishes to our colleague, Dwight Evans, who could not join in person today. I know Dwight is probably watching this hearing and formulating questions, and we all look forward to having him back with us in person very soon. Unemployment insurance is an earned benefit to assist workers who lost their jobs through no fault of their own, helping workers pay the rent and put food on the table while stabilizing our local and national economies. During the pandemic, 22 million, or about one in four, American workers received unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefits kept five million people out of poverty and helped prevent the long, deep recession predicted by economists. The Biden American Rescue Plan's extended unemployment benefits and other investments resulted in record-breaking job growth and the longest stretch of low unemployment since the 1960s. However, the pandemic highlighted that much work remains to make the unemployment insurance program fair and effective. Millions of workers spent hours or days trying to access and complete the unemployment benefit application, and many never succeeded. People of color, younger workers, and lower-paid workers were disproportionately less likely to know they could even apply. The Government Accountability Office also notified us about a deeply troubling and unacceptable problem among workers who applied for benefits: White workers were more likely to receive benefits than Black workers. Unfortunately, problems with equitable access to unemployment benefits preceded the pandemic, with many states making it difficult or near impossible for workers to claim earned unemployment benefits when they needed them. States often justified the roadblocks as fraud prevention, but the stark reality was that workers who were our friends and neighbors were locked out of benefits they earned. The good news is that both red and blue states are now hard at work removing some of these barriers to unemployment benefits. Ways and Means Democrats worked closely with the Biden Administration to provide the American Rescue Plan resources so that the states could take immediate action to ensure that workers receive their benefits fairly and on time, while preventing fraud. The Department of Labor has funded 160 grants in 46 states to ensure basic fairness to people of all ages and races in our unemployment system. I am very proud of the good work in my home state of Illinois, as well as around the country, and I look forward to hearing about these efforts from Jennifer Phillips today. The success of the equity grant shows how much states can do with adequate resources. But we should not confuse the effects of funding shortfalls with the appropriate funding consequences states currently experience when they fail to pay benefits to unemployed workers. The ARPA equity grants were an important first step to make sure that all workers received their earned benefits, and these grants are an investment that should continue. In addition, there are larger structural issues to address, starting with giving the Department of Labor the data and tools it needs to protect workers. Mr. DAVIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back. Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Mr. Davis, for your opening statement there. We will now go to introduction of the witnesses and have their five-minute presentation. I will start with introductions from left to right. J.T. Taylor is the senior director of fraud at ID.me from McLean, Virginia. Next we will have Beth Townsend as executive director of the Iowa Workforce Development in Des Moines, Iowa. Next we will have Chris Stricklin, who is the president of Dunn University in Birmingham, Alabama. We have Will Raderman, who is an employment policy analyst at the Niskanen Center in Washington, D.C. We have Jennifer Phillips, who is the program lead at Georgetown University's Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation in Washington, D.C. Welcome to you all. Mr. Taylor, I will start with you. You are recognized for five minutes. STATEMENT OF J.T. TAYLOR, SENIOR DIRECTOR OF FRAUD, ID.ME Mr. TAYLOR. Thank you, Chairman. Chair LaHood, Ranking Member Davis, and distinguished committee members, thank you for the opportunity to testify today on reforming unemployment insurance to support American workers and businesses. My name is J.T. Taylor, and I currently serve as the senior director of fraud at ID.me. Drawing from over two decades of public service in the United States Secret Service, the U.S. intelligence community, and the U.S. military, I bring a comprehensive perspective on digital fraud and cyber threats. ID.me is a leading digital identity verification platform, independently certified against NIST 863.3. We support over 129 million digital wallets, and help dozens of Federal and state agencies enhance security and streamline identity verification processes. The COVID-19 pandemic presented unprecedented economic challenges requiring a swift response. In March 2020 the CARES Act was signed into law designed to deliver emergency assistance to individuals and businesses affected by the pandemic. However, lacking identity verification controls, this rapid action opened the door to widespread fraud. The GAO reported improper payments totaling $247 billion in 2022, with estimates of pandemic-related UI fraud ranging from 100 billion to 135 billion. ID.me estimates this figure closer to be 400 billion based upon our data and insights from 27 states that we supported during that tumultuous time period. This discrepancy highlights the persistent challenges in accurately quantifying and combating fraud due to the technological limitations and fraud reporting deficiencies across the state networks. Overall, 27 states partnered with ID.me for digital identity verification at the height of the pandemic, implementing IAL2 controls in their respective programs, effectively curbing fraudulent activities and expediting claim processing for legitimate applicants. As a result of our NIST IAL2 solution, we have been credited by seven states for helping to avert a staggering $273 billion in potential fraud loss. We were brought in, in part, because legacy methods of identity verification that have traditionally supported public benefit programs are no longer up to the task of both stopping fraud and ensuring that the communities who need the programs the most are able to access them seamlessly. The combination of stolen personal information and generative AI enables fraudsters to hyper-scale their fraudulent attempts. Biometrics, including facial verification and liveness detection, are essential in combating these threats. ID.me's responsible use of biometrics, guided by principles of fairness, transparency, and choice through the multiple verification pathways ensures that identity verification processes are both secure and inclusive. However, the increasing sophistication of deep fakes from domestic fraudsters to nation-state-affiliated cyber criminals makes securing these inclusive verification pathways much more difficult. The Department of Homeland Security has acknowledged the clear and present danger posed by synthetic content, which threatens various domains, including national security and the financial sector. Biometrics are increasingly proving to be an effective countermeasure to deep fakes and digital injection attacks, and ID.me believes that biometrics will need to play an even bigger role in the protection of benefits in the future. Now is the right time to discuss how responsible use of biometrics, continuous human oversight, and threat research and monitoring will enable the government to maintain its edge in the fight against digital fraud. Congress should work with the executive branch to avoid any form of blanket bans or restrictions on their use, and advance guidelines for responsible deployment of biometrics. The integrity of our national services and benefit programs hinges significantly on the robustness of our identity verification processes. My recommendations on strengthening these mechanisms are as follows: number one, adherence to NIST guidance on identity verification; number two, opt for NIST Identity Assurance level 2; and number three, establish uniformity in data retention and the statute of limitations for prosecutorial support. Additionally, legislative efforts like Protecting Taxpayers and Victims of Unemployment Fraud Act should be commended and advanced as soon as possible. The longer we wait to act, the harder it will be to recover what stolen dollars we can mitigate and the newest evolutions of fraud we are starting to see. Key provisions like extending the statute of limitations for criminal charges and civil actions for prosecuting fraud from five to ten years, and incentivizing states by allowing them to retain a percentage of the recovered overpayments of unemployment benefits and reinvesting these dollars into program integrity and fraud prevention are crucial. By allowing recovered funds to be utilized to modernize state systems for verifying identity and income, states can further enhance their fraud prevention measures, ensuring UI claims are cross- verified against the National Directory of New Hires and the State Information Data Exchange System. It is also important, however, to underscore that states have been--effectively demonstrated, when given choice, they can efficiently leverage the competitive identity verification marketplace developed around the NIST I02 guidelines. Just as Congress added the identity verification requirement under section 242 of the Continued Assistance Act to improve integrity of the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Program, Congress should also consider further steps to add identity verification to traditional UI and subsequent UI programs. Recovery and resilience extend beyond strict measures. They require fostering competitive innovation where technology can thrive to recover stolen funds and prevent future losses. This effort must include continuous dialogue and cooperation between private sector and government entities. As we tackle these challenges and work to ensure solvency and crucial public benefit programs like UI, we owe it to the American taxpayer to implement forward-thinking strategies and robust infrastructures that ensure accessibility, security, and privacy. Thank you again for the opportunity to discuss these crucial issues.   Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Mr. Taylor, and thanks for your prior service to the country. We will next move to Ms. Townsend. You are recognized for five minutes. STATEMENT OF BETH TOWNSEND, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, IOWA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT Ms. TOWNSEND. Thank you, Chairman LaHood and Ranking Member Davis and other members of the committee for the opportunity to speak to you today about Iowa's Reemployment Case Management program and our efforts to help Iowans find reemployment at the earliest possible moment. I am Beth Townsend and, as the director of Iowa Workforce Development since 2015, I am here to talk about the value in providing intensive, one-on-one support and innovative resources as soon as someone files for unemployment. Iowa has seen significant and consistent value in overhauling our approach to helping Iowans find jobs. Iowa Workforce Development is the centerpiece of workforce information programing and solutions in Iowa. We are the agency responsible for administering the unemployment insurance program, implementing all Federal workforce services programs, including 15 American job centers located throughout the state. Iowa, like every state, depends on our employers to move our economy forward. But real, long-term growth requires a workforce that is stable as well as sufficient. We want people to feel fulfilled where they work, which helps decrease the churn in the labor force that has been so common since the pandemic. That is why Iowa Workforce Development focuses on helping its customers find rewarding careers, rather than jobs. This is the path that benefits our entire state the most, when both workers and employers grow together. Nothing is a better illustration of Iowa's innovative efforts to grow and develop its workforce than the Reemployment Case Management program, also known as RCM, which was created in 2021 in response to the workforce shortage caused by the pandemic. Our path to creating the Reemployment Case Management program began in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented joblessness and overwhelmed unemployment systems throughout the nation. One step Governor Reynolds took in an effort to get more Iowans back into the workforce and ease the challenge employers were facing in June of 2021 was to end Iowa's participation in Federal unemployment programs early. Her actions removed the disincentive that the generous pandemic benefits had created for some Iowans to continue to sit on the sidelines. Additionally, in October 2021, Governor Reynolds announced a shift in the mission of Iowa Workforce Development. Our agency's new and overriding policy priority would be to get those jobless Iowans to the other side of the unemployment as quickly as possible. This unemployment--or this simple yet profound change revolved around returning unemployment to its original purposes: serving as a short-term bridge between careers, rather than as a means of long-term support. It is important to understand that the RCM was not created to eliminate or lessen unemployment benefits. Instead, our goal was to reduce the need for benefits by helping the unemployed find work quickly. Our Reemployment Case Management program is built on two things: strengthening the incentives that encourage the unemployed to aggressively search for work, and providing more assistance earlier in the process to increase the odds of their success. To do this we decided to implement a modified and supplementary version of the Federal RESEA program. As you know, RESEA programs have been part of unemployment in the United States for more than a decade. Iowa has operated a version of RESEA since 2015, but under the terms of the federally-funded program which require waiting until claimants receive unemployment benefit payments and are notified about RESEA, career planners were not meeting with unemployment claimants at the earliest until roughly the fifth week after an initial claim was filed. Given the increased demand for workers created by COVID-19, as well as workers' increased need for job search assistance, we deemed that delay to be too long. Instead, RCM was created to be a new, state-funded program that would supplement the Federal version, meeting with unemployment claimants from the week after their initial claims were filed. Unemployment claimants in Iowa now are contacted about RCM during the first week after they file for benefits. Career planners schedule one-on-one appointments and immediately assign claimants to several virtual workshops on topics of how to navigate the computer system for reporting work search, how to build a successful resume, and how to interview for a job. Career planners continue to have regular one-on-one employments with claimants to review job search results and assign reemployment activities. Once the claimant becomes eligible for RESEA, the program takes over the one-on-one appointments and monitoring. The claimant continues to receive these services until he or she is reemployed. If anyone exhausts 50 percent of their eligible benefit weeks, we shift him or her to more intensive services. Because of the RCM program, we have seen a reduction of 30 percent--of over 30 percent in the amount of duration of unemployment benefits, and we have saved approximately $250 million in unemployment benefits in the last two years, paid out, which results in a reduction in unemployment taxes to our employers. Through this program we have been very successful in helping Iowans get back to work faster and helping Iowa employers find the workforce that they need. Thank you.   Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Ms. Townsend. I also want to thank you for your prior service in the Air Force. With that we will next recognize President Stricklin for five minutes. STATEMENT OF CHRIS STRICKLIN, PRESIDENT, DUNN UNIVERSITY Mr. STRICKLIN. Good afternoon, Chairman LaHood, Ranking Member Davis, and distinguished members of the subcommittee. On behalf of the Alabama Workforce Council, I am Chris Stricklin, a retired Air Force colonel with an encore career in the construction industry at Dunn Companies in Birmingham, Alabama. Thank you for the opportunity to speak on our belief the answer to reducing the number of people on unemployment insurance, as well as increasing labor force participation and getting people back to work, lies in revolutionizing our workforce, both removing obstacles to entry and improving the opportunity to earn a livable wage while on a career progression pathway. This requires teamwork and an all-hands- on-deck approach with business, government, and education leaders to create multiple pathways for individuals to receive the education or skills needed to be successful and remain employed. Our team of industry partners, the State of Alabama, the Department of Labor, and our workforce councils simultaneously focus on training those searching for employment for the first time, upskilling those yearning for advancement, and retraining those on unemployment. To be successful we must ask ourselves, what leads people to need unemployment compensation? Our group of leaders began efforts with the belief that workforce issues in UI could not be solved by merely putting a hammer in someone's hand. Instead, we must capture their hearts and their minds, and inspire motivation in both our industries and in their futures. This is not a labor crisis; it is an issue of finding one's personal identity and purpose. Our efforts initially targeted areas with some of the highest unemployment and least skilled population. The training model delivered awareness of job options in different specialties so one could find what interested them, then reduce barriers to entry. Training is provided at reduced cost, designed to be accomplished quickly, and focused on one simple task: train the first two weeks on the job. This delivers a measure by which to guide course development while delivering to industry partners an individual who understand safety and basic operation. This translates to employers with a reduction in on-the-job training, improved safety outcomes, and increased retention. Through our efforts we enabled unskilled, under-skilled, and unemployed individuals the ability to obtain skill certifications which follows for their entire career. We are now reaching a previously untapped or underserved pool of motivated individuals and enabling their career pathways, not merely jobs. Our model of certification is hybrid, in which an individual takes theory portion of the class online, on demand, and on their schedule, then transitions to an in-person lab for the last part of the hands-on. Through this effort, over 3,000 Alabamians have earned credentials to date, and the training has extended to other industries including food and beverage, hotel operations, meat cutter, and mental health worker. Along the same motivation, courses have been conducted in our prisons to reduce recidivism and build a positive future for parolees, specifically developing a commercial driver's license program which has graduated 78 parolee students to date. Our next innovation is occurring this month at Dovetail Landing, with a focus on veterans reentering the workforce after their military service with the Reverse Boot Camp. Alabama has developed a comprehensive approach to decreasing the need for unemployment compensation while increasing the labor force participation and post-secondary attainment rates by concurrently developing new modalities of training that integrate supportive services, work-based learning, enhanced career navigation, and short cycle training programs to allow individuals facing benefits cliffs to persist in training and the workforce. By unbundling and modernizing degrees, Alabama is providing multiple points of entry and exit for Alabamians to enter training and the subsequent workforce. What I am most excited about with regard to reducing unemployment is Governor Kay Ivey's December 23 launch of the Alabama Talent Triad as the nation's first full-scale talent marketplace to connect education and training providers, students and job seekers, and employers based on a direct skills match. In March this year Alabama State Workforce Development Board adopted a policy to require the Alabama Talent Triad to be used for the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act training program intake process. Where this best impacts our conversation today will be a policy to be adopted shortly, which would enable unemployment insurance claimants to apply for all available and suitable employment using the triad. This will allow the state to instantly verify work search requirements. Rather than the traditional three applications per week, Alabamians will now be able to apply for all jobs, potentially hundreds, with the click of one button, and this will be a required first step of signing up for unemployment. In closing, we are a state working together for a better tomorrow for our individuals, our companies, our industries, our communities, our state, and our nation. Together this will revolutionize our social dialogue and develop career routes with progression pathways, especially for those who may have fallen behind. Thank you for the opportunity to sit before you today and explain why we truly believe Alabama is number one in the nation for workforce innovation.   Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, President Stricklin, for that, and we are grateful for your service. Mr. STRICKLIN. Thank you. Chairman LaHOOD. We will next recognize Mr. Raderman for five minutes. You are now recognized. STATEMENT OF WILL RADERMAN, EMPLOYMENT POLICY ANALYST, NISKANEN CENTER Mr. RADERMAN. Chairman LaHood, Ranking Member Davis, and members of the committee, thank you for inviting me here today and for holding a hearing on how to better administer unemployment benefits. My name is Will Raderman, and I am an employment analyst at the Niskanen Center, a non-partisan think tank founded in 2015. We have been privileged to support this committee's work, most recently with the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act. Our central economic philosophy is that strong free markets and robust social policies together provide the foundation for a free and fair society. Unfortunately, programs meant to complement our dynamic economy and keep families stable following job loss are falling short. This includes recurring performance issues with the state unemployment insurance systems. My testimony will touch on three related points. One is that Federal funding sent to state UI agencies for administration has been eroded by inflation and fluctuates year to year, making it difficult to develop strategic, long-term investments. Two, substantial amounts of tax revenue raised specifically for program administration is not ending up in state agency accounts to fund upgrades. And three, Congress should reform the financing process so that state agencies have the resources needed to maintain program integrity. Early on in the COVID pandemic, it became clear that UI agencies were not equipped to handle the surge of claims. Although the agencies received an influx of additional funding to help manage the situation, years worth of necessary improvements could not be implemented overnight. Many legitimate applicants were forced to wait months before receiving their benefits, while criminals stole up to $135 billion, according to GAO estimates. The magnitude of the fraud was unprecedented. However, the administrative shortcomings were not. Past emergencies like Hurricane Katrina exposed many of the same system gaps that were exploited at a far more costly scale during COVID. Similar types of malfunctions will repeat themselves without changes to the administrative financing process so that state agencies can steadily invest in program modernization. One-off funds are not a substitute. Each year Congress provides state agencies with the base allocation to fund program administration, which they must try to plan around, but those allocations are not reliable. Since 2007 the value of the base allocation sent out to states has declined by $900 million when adjusting for inflation, a 27 percent decline. Every agency is worse off as a result. State space funding is also volatile. Less funding is released during stronger economic years, when fewer claims are projected. The result is that UI agencies get fewer resources when they have the most opportunity to focus on system updates. To make matters worse, the approved funding is divided up differently each year through a distributional resource justification model. This formula causes states' allocations to fluctuate over time, and tends to shortchange agencies struggling the most to process benefit claims. In particular, this formula contributes to significant regional disparities that hurt central and southern states. Their agencies can receive half as many dollars per working-age resident as the best-funded ones. Part of the problem is that we are leaving hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue already raised annually for the purpose of UI administration on the sideline. Eighty percent of the funding raised through the Federal unemployment tax is kept in a Federal account to fund program administration, while 20 percent is automatically directed to an emergency benefits account. Yet agencies are not given full access to the 80 percent of funds intended for program administration, due to congressional appropriations and complex trust fund rules. The spare revenue could be used by state UI agencies to improve their systems, but it is rarely made available for that purpose. Instead, a strict account law frequently causes unused funds in the administrative account to be diverted to the emergency benefits account, including more than $4.5 billion in the five years leading up to the pandemic. A better use of those funds would have been to allow UI agencies to upgrade their institutional capacity. To counter these issues, we advise Congress to pursue reforms to establish a stronger connection between what is raised for program administration and what goes back to the UI agencies, and to ensure that agencies receive steadier, inflation-adjusted allocations over time. In conclusion, administrative financing fixes are necessary to maximize agency performance and integrity. Chairman LaHood, Ranking Member Davis, and members of the committee, thank you again for the opportunity to testify today. I look forward to hearing your questions.   Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Mr. Raderman. We will now recognize our last witness, Ms. Phillips. You are recognized for five minutes. STATEMENT OF JENNIFER PHILLIPS, PROGRAM LEAD, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, BEECK CENTER FOR SOCIAL IM- PACT Ms. PHILLIPS. Thank you, Chairman LaHood, Ranking Member Davis, and distinguished members of the subcommittee, for the opportunity to testify today. It is my honor to share insights about how state unemployment insurance agencies are helping historically disenfranchized workers access UI benefits, and how simplifying and improving access for all workers actually boosts UI system integrity. I work for the Beeck Center for Social Impact + Innovation at Georgetown University, and we focus on best-in-class digital service delivery solutions to ensure access to public benefits. And previously I proudly worked for the Illinois Department of Employment Security as the assistant deputy director for service delivery. Unemployment insurance is an economic first responder program. It safeguards eligible workers from financial crises when they lose a job, and it helps stabilize the economy. Eligible workers can and should expect it will work for them when they need it. And Michigan's mission statement really says it all: UI should be fast, fair, and fraud free. Pandemic claim volume, combined with years of declining investment in state technology, brutally exposed foundational cracks in aging systems, and millions of eligible American workers struggled to obtain UI benefits. Research shows that many were historically disenfranchized workers who were less educated, younger, and from racial and ethnic groups. Equitable access means that any eligible worker should be able to effectively and efficiently obtain and--apply and obtain for benefits that they are entitled to without facing undue burdens or barriers. McKinsey Research finds that when a person's experience utilizing state services meets or exceeds expectations, it can boost trust in government, improve morale among civil servants, and lower government agency costs. U.S. DoL has awarded nearly $800 million for ARPA UI modernization to help achieve three congressionally-mandated, mutually reinforcing goals of preventing and detecting fraud, increasing benefit timeliness, and expanding equitable access to UI. These innovation-focused grants offer an unprecedented opportunity to modernize UI. And as a former state UI administrator, I thank you, and I want you to know that UI leaders across the country are hard at work meeting those goals. State innovation will shine a light on what works and what does not. That plus U.S. DoL's recent Building Resiliency recommendations will create a roadmap for the reforms that are most needed. In my written testimony I outline ten UI access challenges and corresponding solutions that U.S. DoL and states are working on, and I will highlight five now.  Ms. PHILLIPS. In Illinois we created an acronym for the first three: PLATE, Plain Language, Accessibility, and Translation for Equity. PLATE encourages thinking about claimant diversity, like for someone who reads at a fifth grade level, or is blind, or is deaf, or whose first language is not English. States like New Jersey--and that is up on the screen-- took complicated UI correspondence and made it easy to understand, with actionable steps for claimants. They also created a how-to toolkit to share with other states like Illinois. Fourth, it is critically important to develop technology solutions that build in iterative feedback loops via user research. We need to build, test, improve, launch in phases, and keep improving. Illinois plans to update its UI application and online claimant portal. To better understand user pain points, Illinois partnered with U.S. DoL to analyze over 270,000 claimant survey responses. We conducted live claim filing observational research, and we analyzed data about where people abandon in the application process. States are improving their ability to conduct this type of customer experience and usability research, ensuring that new technology works for unemployed workers, especially those historically marginalized. Lastly, another key challenge is website navigation and how to apply for UI. States like Michigan, working with human- centered non-profit Civilla, have created a step-by-step claimant roadmap on their website. They offer weekly claim- filing help sessions, and launched a Community Connect program with regional liaisons to help when needed. State outreach efforts that increase human interaction also help confirm that claimants are legitimate filers. States have pivoted from the crush of the pandemic to now pioneering and implementing innovative solutions that increase equitable access to UI. My written testimony has more than 25 examples of that state ingenuity that improve access and can also drive down non-fraud improper payments. To keep this momentum, states need flexibility and continued funding. They need ways to accelerate the work by collaborating. And organizations like the Beeck Center and others, supported by private philanthropy, help convene, connect, and catalyze this change. States need champions. States need Congress to champion additional technology modernization and customer experience improvements to restore faith that when an eligible American worker loses their job, UI will work for them fast, fair, and fraud-free. It was an honor to testify to the committee today, and I welcome your questions. Thank you.   Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Ms. Phillips, and that concludes our formal testimony today. We will now move to the question-and-answer period, and I will recognize myself for questions.  Chairman LaHOOD. Mr. Raderman, I am going to start with you. For years, states have said there is inadequate administrative funding available for making needed improvements to their UI technology and benefit systems. As the chart behind me shows--and I think is up on the monitoring screens here-- outside economic downturns such as the Great Recession of 2008 and COVID-19, states routinely receive less than half of Federal tax revenues paid by employers to administer the UI program. In fact, prior to the pandemic, when the economy was strong, states received about 40 percent of what employers paid in. It is clear that substantial amounts of tax revenue raised specifically for UI administration is not ending up in the state agency hands to enact needed system improvements. So, Mr. Raderman, can you explain some of the challenges this administrative financing mechanism creates, and what can be done to improve it? Mr. RADERMAN. Thank you for the question, Chairman LaHood. So the current financing mechanism is causing states to manage their programs with bare bones resources and with little to no guaranteed funding each year to actually focus on system improvements. The result of that is a lot of the problems that you see during COVID we are seeing in past crises like Hurricane Katrina, as well, because the financing system is not in a good place to actually let states proactively address those problems over time. In order to actually improve the system there needs to be a stronger connection between what is being raised for program administration and what is being returned to states each year. Chairman LaHOOD. And what is your recommendation on improving that connection from a public policy standpoint? Mr. RADERMAN. There is going to be kind of two points in time that I think--or two points of access that need to be changed. One is the actual appropriations. It needs to be that all of the dollars being raised are being approved. But there is also the issue that some of the Federal accounts that manage the dollars end up diverting funds away from program administration when that balance for the administrative account exceeds a pretty low value. So making sure those funds are actually going back to states is crucial, as well. Chairman LaHOOD. And what you just mentioned there, is it your recommendation that it be codified into law? Mr. RADERMAN. Currently, there is a statutory provision that is diverting funds away from the administrative account. And our view at the Niskanen Center is to change that so those funds stay for program administration. Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you for that. I am going to turn next to Ms. Townsend. In your testimony you state that unemployment claimants in the State of Iowa are contacted about the state's reemployment case management program when they first file for benefits so claimants can quickly begin developing skills to successfully navigate a pathway back into the labor force. As I referenced in my opening, our BRIDGE for Workers Act, which gives states additional flexibility to provide reemployment support to any individual receiving benefits as long as the state believes these services would help them return to work more quickly. Ms. Townsend, can you talk more about the return on investment that reemployment services provide, and how that relates to rebuilding our labor force, particularly looking at the success you have had in Iowa? Ms. TOWNSEND. Thank you for that question. So since the inception of the program we have spent approximately $4 million on our Reemployment Case Management, and that pays for 18 caseworkers and a manager. It also pays for some computer upgrades so that we were able to better track individual efforts in terms of their work search activities, and also manage their cases better. Of the $4 million, we anticipate that by the end of 2024 we will have saved $400 million in unemployment benefits. So it is about a 1-to-100 return so far. Just to give you an idea, in 2019, the year before the pandemic, Iowa paid out roughly $388 million in unemployment benefits. Once the Reemployment Case Management system went into effect, we paid $253 million in 2022 and $260 million in 2023, and we expect to--or anticipate paying a similar amount. But one of the things that I would also point out is the value that individuals receive in getting that one-on-one assistance. I receive daily success stories from individuals who, when they lose their job, they are frustrated, they are hopeless, they are anxious, and they are not sure where they are going to go. And having that person in their corner to say, you can do this, you can do more. Let's apply for that job that maybe you didn't think you had the experience for, and let's get your resume and interview skills up to par to get those. So we are helping Iowans get jobs that are beyond what they expected to get. They are getting really good-paying jobs, and they are getting those careers that, like I talked about in my opening statement, they are going to stay with, and they are going to continue to benefit the employer that they have come to in their next act. Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you for that. And, Ms. Townsend, have you found that other states have tried to model or look at your program as a success in what they do? Ms. TOWNSEND. We have received inquiries from other states about how we are doing it. I think it is probably a funding issue. We are--Governor Reynolds gave us ARP dollars to fund the program, and that is what we have been--we will use until 2026, at which point we will ask the legislature for funding if we don't have any additional Federal funding. Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you for that. Mr. Taylor, I will turn to you now. An April report from the GAO analyzed data from 2018 to 2022 that showed the federal government's losses were an estimated $233 to $521 billion annually to fraud, a substantial portion from the unemployment insurance program. I think you referenced that in your statement. Mr. Taylor, can you describe the current trends your company has noticed in relation to UI fraud, and what can be done to strengthen program integrity for the unemployment program? Mr. TAYLOR. Thank you, Chair LaHood. I would offer that-- when ID.me was initially retained by the 27 states in my opening testimony, what we found was an outdated system, a legacy system built around what is known as knowledge-based answers, things like looking at a credit report to see what type of car you drove whenever you were in college or high school. This was an outdated policy. Whenever we went into those 27 states, fraud rates went down, accessibility went up. Today the threats that we are facing to specifically unemployment are--have risen to a critical infrastructure level, primarily driven by nation-state involvement, where they are attacking a number of states. This includes the country of China, it also includes the country of Nigeria, predominantly. So fraud has evolved. Yet the controls that we have put in place have not evolved at the vast majority of states and institutions. ID.me has seen great gains specifically around the IAL2. But even today, we enhance the IAL2 NIST policy by adding in the machine learning aspects. What we have found is that you have to fight AI with AI. And the stolen identities are already out there. Now there is a hyperscaling that is taking place within these criminal networks. As an agent on the front lines of this back in 2020, you would get a phone call and it would be maybe a person that suffered one instance of identity theft. Whenever I came to work at ID.me, we verify 60,000 to 70,000 identities per day. We have a receptacle, we have an email box where you can email in to our team and see if you are under threat of identity theft. And the scale that we see today is a direct result of this hyperscaling of fraud controls. So what I am seeing today is that not only are the outdated aspects of identity verification need to be replaced by at least IAL2, but at the same time fraud is evolving quicker than our policies, and we need to account for that. Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you for that, Mr. Taylor. Those conclude my questions. I will next turn to Ranking Member Davis for your questions. Mr. DAVIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to all of our witnesses. Ms. Phillips, thank you for testifying today and for the important work you did on behalf of Illinois workers. One of the things we fought to do in the American Rescue Plan was invest in equity, and specifically in race equity in the unemployment program. What are some of the long-term benefits for children and communities when workers who are historically left out are able to access their earned benefits? Ms. PHILLIPS. Thank you, Ranking Member Davis, for that question. I have four points to answer that question. One, financial stability is incredibly important. Losing a job is stressful, it has devastating consequences. Sixty-four percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck right now. If you cannot find a job immediately or get UI benefits that you-- assuming you may be eligible, families may not be able to pay bills, rent, and other expenses. My written testimony offers citations on numerous research studies that show how financial stability is a gateway for better child outcomes, emotional and educational success for both parents and children, and reattachment to the labor market. Financial instability can be a disrupting force, like having to move to a different school district because you don't have enough money to pay rent. And parents--research is very clear on parents' unemployment that can also have long-term effects on children's lifelong earnings. The third point is that there is well-documented and well- researched evidence that shows the mental health and the stress impacts that unemployed people face. I cite research in the testimony about that hardship, about anxiety and depression that unemployed workers face that also affects children. And finally, the fourth point is that local economies lose when they--they lose when eligible workers can't get UI, when people have less income and those dollars are not circulating into those local economies. The research also is very clear, and there is numerous studies cited in my testimony about how unemployment has extreme disparities for people of color, namely African American and Hispanic families. Mr. DAVIS. Thank you. Can you tell us more about why ensuring equitable access makes unemployment insurance more effective as a tool for preventing recession or making economic downturns shorter and less bad? Ms. PHILLIPS. I also cite research in my testimony that shows the return on investment for the unemployment insurance program is $1.2 to every dollar spent. There is evidence in my testimony that cites a Harvard research project that shows the importance of UI as an economic stabilizer, demonstrating that states that have more generous unemployment insurance benefits actually significantly lessen the volatility of local economic fluctuations. Having workers have financial stability is good for local economies, and the lack of UI access that happens during financial economic downturns when people cannot access UI and cannot get reemployed right away sets communities of color back economically. Mr. DAVIS. Ms. Phillips, can you tell us more about what data we collect currently to measure fairness in the UI system, and what additional data we might need to hold states fully accountable? Ms. PHILLIPS. Thank you for that question. Currently, I will cite two examples of where there is data collected that has really robust demographic information. Right now the U.S. DoL requires states to report on recipiency rates. That has strong demographic information. But I will say that any new reform that can allow for greater disaggregation of data will help states--will help Congress hold states accountable. One example that I cite in my testimony is the ETA 227 report. That is the overpayment report that states report on--to U.S. DoL quarterly. Within that report there is a section on non-fraud improper payments. In my testimony I cite that just in last--in 2023 in Illinois, the percentage of non-fraud improper payments was actually higher than the fraud improper payments. And we have no demographic disaggregated data to show, like, what is happening with those non-fraud improper payments. They are this--they are--they can be claimant error, state agency error, employer error. But we don't know anything about anything deeper than that. And then finally, I would just like to say, like, in terms of recommendations for what states could collect in the future, Illinois is using its equity grant to look at likelihood to file. One of the equitable access to UI issues is not just what happens when someone actually has applied and is on the journey to reemployment, but we know virtually nothing about people who don't make it to the front door who are potentially eligible. One of the things that Illinois is doing with the equity-- the ARPA equity grant is looking at when employers file a WARN notice, and figuring out if we can find out why people choose to apply or not apply to UI. And finally, states could be collecting customer experience data. They could be collecting survey information like we did in Illinois that asks claimants about their levels of trust, satisfaction, timeliness, and ease with the application process. Mr. DAVIS. Thank you---- Ms. PHILLIPS. Thank you. Mr. DAVIS . Mr. Chairman, for your indulgence, and I yield back. Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Mr. Davis. We will now recognize Mr. Carey of Ohio. Mr. CAREY. First I want to thank the chairman for having the hearing, and I want to join the ranking member in wishing our colleague, Mr. Evans--we can't wait to have you back up here with us. I also want to thank the witnesses for being here to discuss these much-needed reforms to unemployment insurance program--or UI from now on. Today, alongside my colleague, Representative Greg Landsman from Cincinnati, I am proud to introduce the New Opportunities for Business Ownership and Self-Sufficiency, or as we call it, NO BOSS Act. This legislation intends to support individuals pursuing small business ownership by improving the currently under-utilized Self-Employment Assistance Program within the UI program. Our legislation aims to make state participation less burdensome and to encourage greater engagement in the SEAP program.  Mr. CAREY. Mr. Chairman, currently the Federal Unemployment Tax, or FUTA, tax is paid versus revenue received by states whose fraud UI administration is unequal across the states. You can see from the chart behind me. The disparity is most pronounced in the Midwest, where I come from, in Ohio, the south, southwest, according to your own calculations. In Fiscal Year 2022, according to the Department of Labor, FUTA receipts versus amounts returned data, Ohio employers paid an estimated $229 million in FUTA taxes, and Ohio received $105 million in administrative grants from DoL, which is--if you do the math, it is only about 46 percent of the taxes paid. So as you can see, Ohio kind of is getting the short end of the stick here on the UA administration funding versus taxes paid by its employers. Funding that could be used to potentially administrate programs like the Self-Employment Assistance Program, or SEAP, which my bill, the NO BOSS Act, gives states more flexibility to administer. Can you explain a little bit why this disparity is so pronounced in these areas? Mr. RADERMAN. Thank you for the question, Representative. So the way that the dollars for program administration get distributed, it is through a resource justification model, the--kind of the main points of emphasis in terms of how it gets divided up between the states, it includes both program efficiency and processing, the various basic workload, and then how accessible the program is. So is there going to be a higher workload in the state? And so the states that--or the agencies that are having the most issues with either efficiency or accessibility, they end up getting penalized the most when it comes time to actually distributing the dollars. And a better approach would make-- would be to make sure that all the states were getting a much more stable amount, making sure that it was based more on the working population that was overseen, rather than the claims levels itself. Mr. CAREY. Okay, thank you. This committee has done important work to address fraud and overpayments of the UI benefits, including the House-passed Protecting Taxpayers and Victims of Unemployment Fraud Act, which was mentioned earlier today. States like Ohio are making investments in fraud recovery and prevention efforts. And as they continue to recover these fraudulent payments, we should be working to incentivize their investments in these efforts. So back to you, sir. What thoughts do you have on policy recommendations that would incentivize states to pursue fraud recovery work? Mr. RADERMAN. Thank you for the question, Representative. A number of the proposals that have been put forward do include incentives that provide states a percentage of the funds that are reclaimed. I know that there has been proposals to allow the OIG to pursue fraud for a longer period of time, making sure that that fraud--those fraud dollars end up going back to the States. It makes sense to us. But I think making sure that the state agencies have more robust funding moving forward so all the dollars that are being raised specifically for administration, ensuring that they go back to the states and that some of the losses due to inflation over the past several decades get undone, those are both important measures to put them in a better financial position. Mr. CAREY. Again, I want to thank the witnesses, and I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for having this hearing. And with that I yield back. Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Mr. Carey. I will now recognize Mrs. Steel. Mrs. STEEL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman LaHood, for holding this hearing. And thank you, all the witnesses for coming out. Recently, Chairman Smith and I sent a letter to Acting Secretary Su asking for all details of any attempt of her to forgive or write off fraudulent unemployment insurance payments issued by California or any other state. I would love to submit this letter for the record, Mr. Chairman.  Chairman LaHOOD. Yes, I am sorry, yes.  So ordered.   Mrs. STEEL. We are still awaiting a response from the Department, and I want to submit another record of recent L.A. Times article titled, ``Job Growth in California Falls Back, Unemployment Rate Remains Highest in the Country.'' Chairman LaHOOD. Without objection.   Mrs. STEEL. Thank you. Inflation, record high cost, and heavy state regulations are killing small businesses across the state. Before I ask Mr. Taylor for the questions, and I want to ask Ms. Phillips that--you just mentioned while you are speaking that non-fraud proper overpayment is more than fraudulent payments? Ms. PHILLIPS. Thank you, Representative Steel. So, yes, the U.S. Department of Labor requires all states on a quarterly basis to file the ETA 227 report, it is the improper overpayment report. And I am going to just make sure I have the exact number here. So in 2023, 62 percent of Illinois's total overpayments were considered non-fraud, improper payments. And of that 62 percent of non-fraud, improper payments, 57 percent were attributable to a claimant error made somewhere along the process. Mrs. STEEL. So it was Illinois, but not for the national average. Ms. PHILLIPS. Yes, I have not done---- Mrs. STEEL. Yes, because we had this hearing with Acting Secretary Su regarding this, and she said that fraudulent payments by the law that you cannot really forgive because she wanted to forgive this loan that fraudulent payments went out in California. Out of $135 billion, $30 billion happened in California. It is over 22 percent. So that is actually under her watch, because she was labor secretary in California. She was the one who created it. Now she wants to forgive that. That is taxpayers' money, and it should not go to that. So that is why I was asking. I asked the same questions that she couldn't give me any numbers for. So she was hiding something or, you know, you gave me some numbers because she said she doesn't know the numbers nationally, that during the COVID that this UI went out--the payments went out, and then how much was overpayment or how much was fraudulent payments. Ms. PHILLIPS. And Representative Steel, I should amend my comment that the data, the ETA 227 data, is regular UI. It does not include the CARES Act program. Mrs. STEEL. So it has nothing to do with the CARES Act, so---- Ms. PHILLIPS. Doesn't have the CARES Act. Mrs. STEEL. So thank you. Ms. PHILLIPS. Yes. Mrs. STEEL. Thank you very much for clearing that up. According to the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, California estimated it sent $800 million in pandemic unemployment benefits to the 45,000 prisoners. Improper payments to prisoners, scammers, and international gangs are part of the reason California has a Federal unemployment insurance loan balance to the Federal Government of $18.3 billion. If it is not going to be paid, then guess what happens? Employers have to pay a much higher rate. Some estimates show California Employment Development Department distributed approximately 30 billion, as I just mentioned, during the pandemic. So, Mr. Taylor, in your opinion, why was California the epicenter for UI fraud during the pandemic? Mr. TAYLOR. Thank you, Representative Steel. Let me offer that prior to implementing ID.me, and right around October 2020, California was experiencing a landslide of fraud at the time. Coming out of the governor's office and post the ID.me integration, whenever we implemented the IAL2 controls in there, reporting out of the governor's office put it right at $125 billion in fraud savings that ID.me saved the State of California. Subsequently, California has moved away from the IAL2 standard, and now you are starting to see those fraud rates that you are alluding to. As far as the why, it is going back to an old data broker model that I referenced in my testimony, where you are asking for PII that is quite literally available for cents on the dollar on the dark web. Mrs. STEEL. Thank you very much, because I want to make very clear about that, because when Julie Su was Labor Secretary, she actually mentioned that, you know what, they are not up to date with how they are going to make proper payments. I have a few more questions, but I am going to submit in writing because--since my time is over. Mrs. STEEL. I yield back. Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Mrs. Steel. I will now recognize Ms. Chu of California. Ms. CHU. Ms. Phillips, the Niskanen Center--and indeed, some on this dais--assert that the formula that allocates the appropriations among states unfairly shortchanges certain states because the state employers pay more Federal UI taxes than they receive in Federal administrative payments. But the reason that certain central and southeastern states receive smaller allocations is that they erect barriers to receiving UI benefits, they pay UI benefits to fewer workers, and therefore have a smaller claims processing and payment workload. Is that correct? Ms. PHILLIPS. So that is--I worked for Illinois Department of Employment Security, and probably am not the right person to ask on other states. But lower benefits would result in a lower FUTA. I do want to say, Representative Chu, that one of the things that Mr. Raderman's testimony is spot on is that when states have fewer resources, when they need to make the improvements the most, that is a problem, right? State capacity during the pandemic was at its lowest point, and the funding goes up when it is raining the hardest, but the funding goes down when states need to really ramp up and improve both technological and process improvements. Ms. CHU. Well, one thing is clear. There has not been full funding on helping the states deal with the UI workload, and this problem has been going on consistently. In fact, the only time they really had those funds was when the American Rescue Plan modernization funding came in, which you testified about with regard to its positive benefit. Now, the Biden Administration has consistently proposed to increase annual funding and to fully fund the state UI workload to ensure that workers have access to the earned UI benefits while simultaneously helping states prevent fraud and errors. However, Republicans routinely appropriate less than what is needed to fund the state workload. Can you talk about how consistent increased Federal funding for UI administration would enable the state workforce agency directors to increase support for staffing and technology, and perhaps even having things like equity grants? Ms. PHILLIPS. Thank you for that question. In my testimony I celebrate the ARPA UI modernization funding. Congress originally appropriated $2 billion. And last year, as a result of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, that was reduced to $1 billion. As a state administrator at that time, we were planning for that funding. We were working on proposals at that time, and it was a setback, capacity-wise, for us not-- to know that we were not going to have as many resources for improving technology, improving processes, improving reemployment efforts, as well. Ms. CHU. Well, we know that these funds that Congress provided through the American Rescue Plan have indeed made significant strides to help states improve their UI systems by detecting and preventing fraud, promoting equitable access, and ensuring the timely payment of benefits since the pandemic. In fact, because California received these funds, you know, through ARPA, it was able to actually deal with the fraudulent things that took place, was able to streamline its identity verification and fraud reporting system, expand language access, and also eliminate the backlog of unprocessed claims. So, Ms. Phillips, would these type of improvements have been possible without the American Rescue Plan funding that Democrats provided? And how should the lessons learned from these achievements inform any further reform of the UI system? Ms. PHILLIPS. Thank you, Representative. I am going to start backwards with the lessons. Organizations like the Beeck Center and others are trying to help connect states with one another. In my testimony U.S. DoL also has been documenting the ingenuity that states are working on not only on equitable access to UI, but also on timeliness of benefits, and detection of fraud, and preventing fraud. I would argue that one of the best ways to prevent and detect fraud is by--I know this might sound strange coming from someone working on digital benefits, but making sure that the digital benefit access is also paired with in-person options, as is required by law, is an important fraud prevention mechanism. Your question about whether this would happen--whether all of this innovation would have happened or would be happening if the ARPA funding was not there, I would argue probably not, for many of the reasons that Mr. Raderman was talking about, that the resource justification model makes it difficult to have extra resources to be able to work on modernization efforts. Ms. CHU. Thank you. I yield back. Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you. Now I recognize Mr. Moore of Utah. Mr. MOORE of Utah. Thank you, Chairman LaHood, for holding this important hearing. I would look back to when I first ran for this seat. It was just three-and-a-half years ago, and unemployment insurance was, you know, just becoming a thing with--as we were trying to navigate the pandemic and, you know, seeing the workforce go through a stress point. And it was that moment that, to me, was like we are not going to be able to solve these things at the Federal level. And it continually got worse. And the thing that was the most frustrating to a lot of my constituents, particularly small business owners, was not being able to hire people, or not being able to get some of their folks back to work. That is an un-American concept. It is un- American. I get the pandemic was a tricky thing to navigate, and that different states handled it different ways, but we can't ever get to that point again. We can't ever get to that point again where it was easier to stay home and engage in this type of program than it was to go back to work. And, you know, we didn't--I look back on it, and we made mistakes as a country, as a Federal Government, trying to do too much and creating unintended consequences. And I think the data will bear that out over the history of time. We saw an enormous amount of inflation right after the ARPA, or the American Rescue Plan, was passed. We cannot have so much money chasing too few goods, especially when there was a stress on supply chain and things like that. And that, I think, is leading to my main point and one question simply that I have for Ms. Townsend. Like Iowa, Utah is a state that has been on the forefront of creating high- performance service delivery models for the unemployed and those lacking the job skills required to fully participate in the workforce. And so my point here, ultimately, is what are we doing at the state level to make sure these programs are actually run well? And where do we get the outcomes? We are just not going to get the outcomes from the Federal Government. The nation is too big, the population is too high, and we do not have the purview and the ability to properly target where the work needs to be done. The Utah Department of Workforce Services, Utah's integrated model for workforce and social assistance, simplified the application process for individuals seeking assistance such as unemployment insurance, and provides a case manager who identifies suitable services based on an individual's needs. Can you speak to the effectiveness of individuals receiving unemployment benefits having case managers in shortening their duration on unemployment insurance and finding meaningful employment? Ms. TOWNSEND. Absolutely. Thank you for the question, Representative Moore. So what we have found in Iowa is that when individuals, like I said before, come into the American job centers or contact Iowa Workforce Development after they have filed a claim for unemployment benefits, and we assign a single individual to help walk them through the process, most of them have not looked for a job for a period of time. Many of them have not looked for a new job for decades. And so--and as anyone who has been paying attention knows, the way to find a job now is not the way it was even five years ago, even pre- pandemic. So having someone available to help them navigate the new system of basically virtual and all-digital application process, having someone available to look through your resume-- because, for instance, in Iowa we have more jobs than we have unemployed, and I know it is the same in Utah. If you are applying for jobs and you are not getting a response, then the problem is probably in your resume. It is probably in the way that you are going about your job search. And so one of the things that we can do with the reemployment case management is look at what jobs are you applying for? Are they the right jobs for your skills and your experience? What other jobs should you be applying for? And is there something in your resume that we need to fix or improve? And so, when they get that one-on-one assistance, it helps direct them not only to the better jobs that they may not have otherwise realized they were eligible for, but also gives them that support and the hope that I can get this job. And they do. And we see--every day we are seeing stories about people who are getting jobs that pay them way more than they were making before they became unemployed. Mr. MOORE of Utah. Absolutely, thank you. And I think the irony that--I can even, you know, admit it myself that I am saying that having a case manager involved, some people would claim that is more bureaucracy, right? What I am saying is, if we don't have that special attention to do this at the most basic level, where we are actually helping the individuals, we are going to continue, like Mr. Taylor was highlighting, the just an enormous amount of fraud that slips through the system unless you give it that special attention. And that is why I want to be able to communicate and help spread throughout the country that states that do this well, they need to be replicated, and we don't need to just continue to throw more money at the problem. You need to put the right type of resources at the ground level to help these individuals get out of this mess, and that should be an incredibly bipartisan approach. And if you look beyond the rhetoric, that is what this Work and Welfare Committee is trying to do, is find the help that they need, and lift people out of these horrible situations that they get put in. Ms. Townsend and to the rest of the witnesses, I appreciate your perspective, and I yield back. Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Mr. Moore. We will recognize Ms. Tenney of New York. Ms. TENNEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the witnesses. This is a really important issue. I am a small employer up in upstate New York. And, you know, there has been serious systemic problems with unemployment insurance in this program, and particularly in the State of New York. There have been over 11 billion fraudulent unemployment payments since 2020. Yet despite this figure, New York has only recovered a small fraction of that. New York is one of only two states, along with California, that remains delinquent on its loans borrowed from the Federal Unemployment Trust Fund and the COVID-19--and that was from the COVID-19 pandemic. The failure of Albany--and it is run by the Democrats right now, it is one-party rule all across the board--to repay the debts will force employers to bear the burden of these increased Federal unemployment taxes. And this debt remains, and it has been a tremendous burden. It has forced businesses to close in upstate New York. It is really heartbreaking. And I just think it is worthy of note that last year, in our meeting on February of--I believe it was 2023--we had the inspector general here to discuss this unemployment at our last Ways and Means full committee hearing. And I asked the inspector general about New York, and he specifically said, ``We tasked the governor of New York''--at the time it was Governor Cuomo--``in 2011 to change the systems in place, the computer systems, the technology, or you are going to have a real serious problem with fraud.'' And we ended up with that. And guess who is paying the price? Our beleaguered employers in upstate New York. And so, because of this fiscal mismanagement and these real-world consequences, they are hiking this Federal unemployment tax that really particularly hits the smaller businesses, a lot of restaurants, a lot of businesses forced to close, and also those who are unable to find people to replace them. That is why I am happy to join with Michelle Steel of California. We introduced legislation to protect employers in our respective states, New York and California. The small businesses in New York, and also California, should not be punished because of their state government's incompetence. And it really is, it is a huge concern because we do have programs to help people temporarily move into unemployment in their attempt to get a new job. So I appreciate all the ideas and the tasks that you have here. And I first wanted to just say thank you to Colonel Stricklin for your innovation in reading your testimony and hearing your testimony today on what you have done on trying to get people back into the workforce, particularly veterans, and I appreciate that. My son just became a major yesterday in the Marine Corps, so it was kind of fun to pin his little oak leaf cluster on him yesterday. And so--but I know that so many people that--we have so many incredible people that serve in our military who can convert those skills into, you know, into the private sector when they go into their new careers, and so I thought maybe what you might explain to us in enhancing what you talked about, how you actually got people back to work, how this detrimental effect of our workforce shortage--how did you get businesses to deal with initiatives to get people back into the workforce in light of some of the issues we have today, where people almost have more incentives to stay home than they do to go to work? How do you inspire people to get out, go to work, take care of their families, pay taxes that we need for some of our services? How did you do that? And I would love to hear about it, especially with your unique background as a military member. Mr. STRICKLIN. Thank you for the opportunity to respond to that, and it is something that we are very passionate about. And when we started this five years ago in our group, we were not happy with the progress being made. And so we met and said we are going to make a difference. And this all started on a cocktail napkin among competitors in industry, among our training aspects of the Alabama Community College system and among our government. And we sat down and said, ``How do we get people inspired to a new tomorrow? We need to find something they are passionate about, and we need to reduce the barriers to entry.'' So when we started these courses, it started with a skid steer and a pile of rocks, a pile of aggregates, and we had people come in to learn this single piece of equipment. And everybody agreed that we are going to work together to make a difference. And then, down the road, when we are finished with this, we are going to compete over hiring them to get them back into our workforce. Because if we don't have a better workforce, there is nothing to compete with down the road. And these individuals--if I could tell one quick story--so as we did the first pilot group, somebody went through and he thought he was going to earn a new job. And in three classes down the road I happened to be there, and he came up and hugged my neck, and he said, ``I want to thank you and the committee for what you are doing because I thought I was getting a new job, but this didn't change my pay, it changed my family and my kids' futures, because you changed our level of income so that now I can offer more to my kids and offer more for their future.'' And that is how we inspire a new tomorrow to them. We all want good. We all love this nation. Ms. TENNEY. So your company invests in getting new people during that transition period, where they are training and getting them off unemployment and getting into your business. Is that---- Mr. STRICKLIN. Yes, ma'am. And originally, we didn't know-- it was funded by a grant. We didn't know if we were going to get it. And the partners in industry went to our training aspect. And we said, ``If we don't get the grant, we will write a check to cover the first year of training.'' Now, mind you, none of us wanted to, but we were willing to. And luckily, the grant came through. And when I mentioned in my testimony we have trained over 3,000 Alabamians, none of those 3,000 Alabamians have paid a cent for their training. It has all been through grants that we have enabled them to a new tomorrow. Ms. TENNEY. Well, thank you so much. My time has expired. But thank you to everyone. I appreciate your insight. Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you. I recognize Ms. Moore of Wisconsin. Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Mr. Ranking Member. I think this is an extremely important discussion, and I want to get a few things straight before I move on. I think, Ms. Phillips, you were talking about the non- fraudulent improper payments that were made. Did you say that we have not disaggregated what percentage of the overpayments were fraudulent versus non-fraudulent, accidental? Ms. PHILLIPS. So we--thank you, Representative Moore, for that question. The ETA 227 has no demographic information. Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Demographic. Ms. PHILLIPS. There is no disaggregated demographic information. It is broken down by what type of improper--non- fraud, improper error code a state reports on that quarterly report, and the---- Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. But we do know which ones were---- Ms. PHILLIPS. We know whether---- Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin . Which ones were fraudulent---- Ms. PHILLIPS. Yes. Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin . Versus improper payment. Ms. PHILLIPS. Non---- Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. And what percentage is that? That wasn't clear to me. Ms. PHILLIPS. So I only have--anyone could look at the information, state by state or nationally. But I can only speak right now to Illinois's numbers. And in 2023, as I mentioned just a minute ago--I just want to make sure I am completely accurate here--that 62 percent of Illinois's total improper payments--total overpayments were considered non-fraud improper payments. Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Taylor, would you agree with that? I probably should have asked you that. What percentage of these payments were improper and other part fraudulent? Mr. TAYLOR. It depends on the state, Representative Moore. There was a wide variety of disparity when it comes to what we call first-party and third-party fraud, third-party fraud being the stolen identity---- Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Yes, yes. Mr. TAYLOR . First-party improper. Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Well, the reason that I have just burnt up so much of my time on this, Mr. LaHood, is because I just think our committee was focusing on this as if the majority of these payments were fraudulent. And, I mean, thank God we made these payments because I think it was Ms. Phillips that said 64 percent of folks live paycheck to paycheck, and we know what people were doing four years ago. I mean, they were maxing out their credit cards, hoarding toilet paper. And so, we want to just be clear that it was important. I mean, all of you would agree that, despite the fraud, which is terrible, that we saved people's lives, literally, by providing this benefit. Ms. Townsend, your reemployment work strategies. I mean, I am very impressed with your ability to get people back to work. It is a model that everybody has to look at. But I am wondering if what we used to say, that you bite your hand to spite your face or whatever--haven't we found that states that did a remarkable job of avoiding inflationary problems over the years reduced staffing, and then found themselves in this situation where we had an emergency and they just didn't have the staffing in place as a punishment, almost, for their doing so well in getting people unemployed? So, I am wondering if any of you feel that the formula maybe punishes states that do a good job. Maybe I will ask you that, Ms. Phillips, and also--yes, go on. Ms. PHILLIPS. Well, I think I would go back to Mr. Raderman's comments earlier that the way the resource justification model works is that when there is a low demand for unemployment benefits, that is also a low administrative amount of money that states have, and so you can't fix the roof during that time. So that is one point. But I also want to comment on the workforce aspect because, as a former fellow UI administrator, states across the country are working on the RESEA program, and most administrators believe that the UI program is a temporary--it is a trampoline. But the people that are eligible to apply for UI are workers, and they want to get back to work. And most state agencies are working on---- Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Can I---- Ms. PHILLIPS . That employment piece---- Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Can I ask something very quick before I get cut off? Ms. PHILLIPS. Mm-hmm. Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Do we see instances where there are barriers to applying to unemployment? I mean, like the state has taken the position that we don't want to provide this benefit, and so many more people who are eligible and need it don't get it, and that also lowers the numbers and sort of masks the need? Ms. PHILLIPS. Representative Moore, I can really only speak from my experience in Illinois that there was--there is no preventing people from applying. But I think we know, especially through the pandemic, the challenges that any UI claimant faces in applying, and the administrative burdens that they face on online applications, on certification processes, on other documentation that they need to provide. I know I am over time, but one of the things that I cannot unsee is I observed these live claim filing observations, and I watched people from five different regions in Illinois apply, including an older woman, a 76-year-old woman from downstate Illinois near Carbondale, who was struggling mightily. She came into the office because she couldn't apply online. It wasn't working for her. There were many different blockades that I won't go into, but there are improvements that can be made to the actual application process. Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, for your indulgence. Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Ms. Moore. I recognize Mr. Smucker of Pennsylvania. Mr. SMUCKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for convening this hearing. I would like to talk a little bit about the state's management of their own unemployment funds. And as a former business owner, I think most business owners, you know, we value unemployment. We know that when you go through rough times, it is a safety net for employees that they are no longer able to provide work for. Even most business owners, at least in our case, I think we understood the need for a rating system--I was in Pennsylvania a rating system based on your own experience so that businesses who are laying off more workers are paying more. But what did get frustrating was when states mismanaged their own funds and, as a result, businesses in Pennsylvania, for instance, had much higher rates and it was harder to compete. And I am concerned right now, you know--during the pandemic we, of course, know that states' unemployment budgets were strained. There was a huge surge in claims. We have been talking about that this entire hearing. The federal government provided loans to states to help them bridge the gap and, of course, expected that to last while the pandemic lasts, and until individuals returned to work, and then expected, I think, to begin paying back those loans. So it is--there are some states, like California, New York that have yet to pay the federal government for those loans from four years ago. And in fact, they not only have been accumulating that debt, but also now paying high interest. So in California $650 million already paid in interest, and another $550 million in interest due to the federal government by September 30. That really, I think, is going to matter to small businesses in those states who probably will end up having to bail out the states as a result of the bad policies by the governors and the administrations in those states. And it should maybe be even concerning to us, because eventually all taxpayers, if states can't pay that back, may need to bail them out even further. And so I was proud to have cosponsored Representative Steel and Representative Tenney's legislation to ensure that small businesses will not have their credits against the FUTA, the Federal tax rate, reduced and will not see a dramatic increase. And I hope that today's hearing will call attention to best practices that states can utilize, can take advantage of during strong economic times to prevent these kind of future system strains and collapses in the future. So Mr. Raderman, what actions can Congress take to ensure that states who receive Federal loans for their UI programs repay those loans in a timely manner, with hopefully minimal to zero impact on small businesses? Mr. RADERMAN. Thank you for the question, Representative. In terms of the state loans that were taken out, the way the programs are currently structured, it does fall to the states to fund the benefits. Our view is that the taxable wage base that is used to actually finance the state level benefits--I can't speak to every state, but I know for California and New York in particular, those wage bases have not been adjusted for inflation over time, and so it has become especially difficult to actually fund the benefits when downturns do occur, and that kind of results in that large amount of debt. So the preference is to make sure that that wage base is indexed moving forward, or raised and indexed, and you can actually lower the rates overall so that businesses will have a bit more stable tax rates moving forward. Mr. SMUCKER. With the budget hole that we are in now in those particular states, do you agree it will eventually probably impact the small businesses there? And how do you think it will do that? Mr. RADERMAN. I agree, they are going to be facing higher rates at the moment. And I think it is important to address the financing issues now---- Mr. SMUCKER. I think it---- Mr. RADERMAN . So that there is not a problem moving forward. Mr. SMUCKER. I think there is a lot of concern there. I appreciate you responding to that. Mr. Stricklin, your testimony was really impressive. It sounds like the program that you have in Alabama is very impressive. I was really just interested in one aspect of it, and I am out of time. But you talked--I have seen a lot of employee workforce education and training programs, and apprenticeship programs, and so on. Your goal is to train the first two weeks on the job. I have never really seen that exactly, and I found that really interesting. Really fascinating, actually. I would love to have you expand a little bit on that. Mr. STRICKLIN. Yes, sir. Thanks for the opportunity to expand on that. And when we sat down in the beginning, and you look at this problem--and it is so big you never know where to start, right? How do we climb a mountain? We have got to take the first step. And when we looked at this we said we have to have something manageable and measurable so that we know how to develop the training courses. And we said, as owners of businesses, as small businesses, what do I want most from an employee when they show up? And we really boiled it back to I would love for somebody to walk in on day one of their third week, they know how to put on their safety equipment, they know where to go in the office, they know basic operation of the equipment. Then we can train them the specifics of what to do. And that is where that came from, is let's just train the first two weeks. That way they are showing up on day one of week three, and they are ready to run. Like, your company or my company or any company wants to train them in the specifics of what we do there and what our competitive advantage is. Running a piece of equipment is running a piece of equipment. Operating a piece of equipment is---- Mr. SMUCKER. It is a really interesting concept, and I am out of time. Mr. STRICKLIN. Thank you, sir. Mr. SMUCKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, yes. Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Mr. Smucker. Well, that concludes our question-and-answer period. I know it went by quickly. Let me just say in closing here how grateful we are for your generous testimony here today. As I think we all learned from this hearing, this is a complex subject. There are many nuances here that need to be worked out. And we have to figure out ways to rebuild and restore confidence in this system moving forward. And so this was a great learning process for the members here. It was great for me and everybody else here. So we appreciate your ideas, your proposals, your successes that you have had. And we look forward to staying in touch with you as we put together further public policy initiatives to address these problems and serve the people that we need to serve. So with that, please be advised that members have two weeks to submit written questions to be answered later in writing. Those questions and your answers will be part of the formal record. With that, we are grateful again for you being here today, and the committee stands adjourned.
