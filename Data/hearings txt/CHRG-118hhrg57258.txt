FINANCIAL CONDITIONS IN FARM COUNTRY ---------- TUESDAY, JULY 23, 2024 House of Representatives, Committee on Agriculture, Washington, D.C. The Committee met, pursuant to call, at 10:00 a.m., in Room 1300 of the Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Glenn Thompson  presiding. Members present: Thompson, Lucas, Austin Scott of Georgia, LaMalfa, Rouzer, Bacon, Bost, Johnson, Baird, Mann, Feenstra, Miller of Illinois, Moore, Finstad, Rose, De La Cruz, Duarte, Nunn, Alford, Chavez-DeRemer, Miller of Ohio, David Scott of Georgia, Costa, McGovern, Adams, Spanberger, Hayes, Brown, Davids of Kansas, Slotkin, Salinas, Davis of North Carolina, Budzinski, Sorensen, Crockett, Jackson of Illinois, Carbajal, Craig, Soto, and Bishop. Staff present: Tim Fitzgerald, Harlea Hoelscher, Patricia Straughn, Trevor White, John Konya, Kate Fink, Clark Ogilvie, Emily Pliscott, Ashley Smith, and Dana Sandman. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GLENN THOMPSON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM PENNSYLVANIA The Chairman. The Committee will now come to order. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's hearing entitled, Financial Conditions in Farm Country. After brief opening remarks, Members will receive testimony from our witnesses today, and then the hearing will be open to questions. So let me take the liberty of my opening statement. Good morning, everyone. I would like to welcome you all today to today's hearing on the state of the farm economy. I would like to extend a special welcome and thanks to our witnesses. The panel that we have convened will share their insights and personal experiences on the deteriorating financial conditions facing producers in the agricultural supply chain. Agriculture is not just an industry; it is the backbone of our economy and a cornerstone of our national security. American farmers, ranchers, and the supply chain they rely on work together tirelessly to feed and clothe our nation and the world, while providing more than 48 million jobs. Despite their resilience and ingenuity, the unprecedented challenges facing the entire agriculture sector threaten to ignite another farm financial crisis. Declining prices in cash receipts, escalating natural disasters, and increasing input costs have created a perfect storm that will compromise the foundation of our agriculture economy. We are living through the largest 2 year decline in farm income in history. At the end of 2024, total farm sector debt will be the highest the United States has seen at least since 1970. Most farmers and ranchers, including those here today with us, are likely to be worse off financially by year's end. Unfortunately, the farm safety net that is meant to provide our farmers and ranchers with stability during these times has not seen significant investment since 2002. In fact, the resources dedicated to the total farm safety net have declined 30 percent over the past 22 years. The Commodity Title alone has seen an 81 percent reduction in spending power during that same time. Simply put, the lack of support for those that feed the world is unacceptable. That is why this Committee listened to the communities across the country and passed the bipartisan Farm, Food, and National Security Act of 2024 (H.R. 8467) 2 months ago. It represents the largest permanent investment in the farm safety net, conservation, trade promotion, specialty crops, research, and livestock biosecurity in more than 2 decades. It will give renewed strength to the farm safety net just when producers need it most. There are a few pundits that have taken the last few months to spread misinformation about this Committee's bipartisan product in an attempt to sow division. Now, let me be clear. This is a farm bill that provides significant improvement for all producers. The legislation was drafted under the principle that we would deliver what America's producers need, no more and certainly no less. As a result, it looks different from state to state and from farm to farm. The policy changes this Committee made were targeted to provide the greatest return on investment possible so that all producers will be better off. The bill passed out of this Committee is an investment in the future, not a venue for empty relitigating of fights from the past. But if folks do want to discuss the past, here are the facts. The 2002 Farm Bill was the last farm bill to invest in the commodity programs. The Democrat-led 2008 Farm Bill, not this current Committee, cut money out of the crop insurance while investing in conservation and nutrition programs. Because of a deficit reduction exercise, the 2014 Farm Bill saw commodity programs cut by over 30 percent while conservation and nutrition were left relatively unscathed. Finally, since the enactment of the 2018 Farm Bill, Democrats in Congress unilaterally added billions to climate and conservation programs, and the current Administration added \1/4\ of $1 trillion to the nutrition programs, all while ignoring the farm safety net. The romanticized Farm Bill Coalition often talked about is a one-sided partisan talking point. Producers are constantly reminded of hundreds of billions of dollars of SNAP and climate spending and reprimanded when they seek any level of parity. Now, I will not apologize for advancing a bill that seeks to put the farm back into farm bill. I also won't apologize for advancing a bill that was written by every Member of this Committee, 40 provisions that were put into this that were just led by my Democratic colleagues and friends, and I don't put things in legislation just to kind of buy a vote. I put it in there because it was great legislation. It helped to put the farm back into farm bill, 140 provisions that were led in a bipartisan way, at least one Democrat, one Republican, so a strong bipartisan bill that puts the farm back into farm bill. Now, I am tired of the politics and the gamesmanship, and I know folks out in the countryside are, too. Unfortunately, through this process, I have been saddled with a meddling Senate Democrat and others who do not seem to appreciate the dire circumstances in farm country. As recently as last week, House Agriculture Committee Democrats expressed a preference to see a bill fail before engaging. So I will say this again. If there are Members on the other side of the aisle who truly want to see a farm bill come to fruition this year, my door remains open to renegotiation from any partner willing to come to the table with a serious proposal and not more redlines. For those who believe that the only path forward with the time we have remaining in this Congress is an informal pre- conference negotiation with the Senate, that is not my preferred option, but it is one I am willing to entertain. However, I cannot reconcile, nor negotiate a bipartisan 900 page bill with a partisan 90 page summary. For that to be viable, Chairwoman Stabenow needs to unveil her bill text. I hope that after listening to our guests today, everyone in this room and watching across the country will understand the urgency by which we must act. For the first time in a long time, this Committee has a chance to be proactive instead of reactive to prevent disaster for our producers rather than picking up the pieces afterwards with ineffective and inefficient ad hoc support and to establish a foundation for the future of the farm economy. Let's not waste that opportunity.  Prepared Statement of Hon. Glenn Thompson, a Representative in Congress from Pennsylvania Good morning.

Let's not waste that opportunity. With that I yield to the Ranking Member. The Chairman. And with that, I would now like to welcome my good friend, the distinguished Ranking Member, the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Scott, for any opening remarks he would like to give. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DAVID SCOTT, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM GEORGIA Mr. David Scott of Georgia. And thank you, Mr. Chairman, and it is good to see you and be with everyone this morning. Ladies and gentlemen, our hearing today is focused on farm financial conditions and the well being of our farmers and the health of our rural communities. Over the past few years, we have heard the cry for a stronger farm safety net, and here is why. Commodity prices are not keeping up with higher input and credit costs. That is where we are and why we need to really address this issue to help our farmers. It is clear that we need to come together, Republicans and Democrats, on a farm bill that strengthens the farm safety net, and we are going to do it together. I remain committed to enacting a truly bipartisan farm bill this Congress that enhances the safety net for our farmers and protects the safety net for hungry families as well. Our challenge remains today what it was before. How do we pay for what we need to be done in the farm bill? I remain concerned that the pending 2024 Farm Bill eliminates USDA's ability to use CCC funds to help insulate and protect our farmers from market shocks. Ladies and gentlemen, in 2020, then-Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, my good friend who I served with in the Georgia State Senate as State Senators, Secretary Perdue used approximately $23 billion in CCC funds for the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, and this helped our farmers survive lower prices that were rising as a result of COVID-19. We didn't restrict the CCC when my friend Sonny Perdue was Agriculture Secretary, and we must not do it now for the same reason. In 2018 and 2019, Sonny Perdue used the CCC for the Market Facilitation Program, which distributed $23 billion in payments to eligible farmers to help offset losses from the Trump trade war. And while Secretary Perdue's trade program had many faults, the ability of USDA to help farmers stay afloat was essential. We will hear more about this from our witnesses later today. And I also want to call to everyone's mind that both former President Donald Trump and his partner, Senator J.D. Vance, have promised even more tariffs and trade wars. They have said so. The Republican Party even enshrined this in their official party platform last week. So let's be real. There is no way we got the farmers' best interest at heart if we are going to remove the CCC helping hand when our contenders for the Presidency on the Republican side have already said they would do a trade war. American farmers bore the brunt of the trade war the last time, and they would be hard hit again if Republicans pursue an economic agenda that will undermine the stability of the American commodity prices and lead to a retaliatory tariff war. The prospect of a new trade war while eliminating the Secretary's CCC authority, the only tool that kept family farmers afloat, is nearsighted and it is dangerous. Bottom line, if we want to get a farm bill done this year, as these witnesses who are before us want, we have to find a different way to pay for it without locking away this important tool for 5 years. We have to have the CCC. I am sincere in my offer to you, Mr. Chairman, my friend, to work on a bipartisan basis to find an acceptable improvement to the bill and to bring it to the floor. Time is marching on, as I pointed out in our last hearing. We are in a desperate time situation. I look forward to working with you and the Committee, and Democrats on my side look forward to working together. There is nothing we want more than a good bipartisan bill. I look forward to hearing from our distinguished panel today as they share their work in addressing the current financial situation of our farmers across our nation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. I thank the gentleman. The chair would request that other Members submit their opening statements for the record so that our witnesses can begin their testimony and to ensure that there is ample time for questions. To introduce our first witness today, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from Minnesota, Mr. Finstad. Mr. Finstad. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, Members, it is an honor for me today to welcome my friend and constituent of southern Minnesota to the Committee today, Dr. Dana Allen-Tully. Dana is a great example of southern Minnesota values. She serves as President of the Minnesota Corn Growers Association, where she advocates on behalf of 7,000 farm families, including mine. She has dedicated her career to agriculture as a leading voice for farmers in Minnesota and across this country. As long as I have known Dana, she has always said yes to every opportunity to give back to her community. Dana and her family own and manage a diversified family farm near Eyota, Minnesota, where she raises dairy and produces corn, soybeans, alfalfa, alongside her parents, brother, and husband Jim, who is with us here today. Dana is a product of the University of Minnesota. Go Gophers. That is where I met Dana years ago. She received her undergraduate education there, as well as a doctorate in ruminant nutrition with a focus on dairy, one of the smartest people that I had the honor to go to school with. Dana, thank you for joining us here today. We look forward to hearing your testimony about the issues affecting corn growers and the overall farm economy. And, Mr. Chairman, with that, I yield back. The Chairman. I thank the gentleman. Now, to introduce our second witness, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Rouzer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is my pleasure and honor to introduce Mr. David Dunlow, who I have known for a long, long time, and a great farmer in North Carolina, big in cotton, peanuts, and everything else. He is an incredible farmer and been a great advocate for the industry for many, many years. Great to have you here. The Chairman. I thank the gentleman. Our third witness today is Mr. Tony Hotchkiss, the Chairman of the Agriculture and Rural Bankers Committee for the American Banking Association. Welcome. Our fourth witness today is Mr. Joey Caldwell, who is the Senior Vice President for retail for GreenPoint Ag Holdings, LLC. Welcome as well. And our fifth and final witness today is Dr. Ronald Rainey, who is the Assistant Vice President, Professor, and Center Director for the University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture. To all of our witnesses today, thank you for joining us today. You each have 5 minutes. The timer in front of you will count down to zero, at which point your time has expired. Dr. Allen-Tully, please begin when you are ready. STATEMENT OF DANA ALLEN-TULLY, Ph.D., PRESIDENT, MINNESOTA CORN GROWERS, EYOTA, MN Dr. Allen-Tully. Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member Scott, Committee Members, thank you for inviting me to testify. My name is Dana Allen-Tully, and my family and I operate a diversified family farm near Eyota, Minnesota, where we produce dairy, corn, soybeans, alfalfa, and vegetables. I also serve as President of the Minnesota Corn Growers, representing thousands of farm families. I would like to begin by thanking each of you for serving on this Committee and for the work you do on behalf of farm and ranch families, rural communities, and all people who are helped by the farm bill. I don't want to be discouraging this morning, but it is important to provide a glimpse at today's economic picture for agriculture. Unless conditions change, we are facing a perfect storm, though I don't think it will be fully understood until early next year when farmers are unable to secure loans because they can't cash-flow. Plummeting crop prices, high cost of production, doubling interest rates, natural disasters, and tightening credit are some of the key culprits. Working capital is fast depleting. John Deere's layoff of thousands of workers is a canary in the coal mine. A farm bill extension will not stop the hemorrhaging. Even a new farm bill with a strong safety net may not be timely or sufficient, though I pray Congress passes a farm bill this year because it will help in the long run. In the near-term, Senator Heinrich has said that Congress must pass a disaster supplemental as soon as possible. If things don't turn around, a supplemental may be needed to address production and economic losses. USDA says farm income will fall sharply this year. In the biggest year-to-year drop on record, net farm income will fall $43 billion, or 27 percent, after falling 19 percent from 2022 to 2023. Since 2022, net farm income has fallen 40 percent, the largest 2 year drop on record. The national average corn yield a farm would have to make this year to break even is 219 bushels per acre, 27 percent higher than the 10 year average, and for soybeans, it is 56 bushels, or 12 percent higher. This is true across all commodities. We are all facing losses of more than $150 per acre. The University of Minnesota puts our losses at $233 per acre. Bottom line, farm and ranch families need help. What can you do? Putting aside other issues, the Commodity Title and crop insurance provision in the House farm bill are excellent and would go a long way in helping all farm families, regions, and commodities. The PLC/ARC reference price represents a 40 increase and, along with the reference price escalator, should help carry us through to better times. It also makes key improvements to ARC, updates pay limits, and helps to ensure eligibility rules don't lock family farms out of the safety net. My family members and I work on the farm, but we want to make sure our farm continues after us, so we recruited a couple of young great farmers, beginning farmers who work with us. We regard them as family, and we hope the farm bill will ensure farm families like ours are not penalized. If the Senate committee can produce a bipartisan bill very soon with the same safety net provisions, Congress will be well-positioned to pass a farm bill farmers can count on. Second, urge USDA to resume ERP payments for 2022. Two years is a long time to wait. And third, watch the farm economy over the coming months, and if that perfect storm keeps developing, consider a disaster supplemental covering production and economic losses. In Minnesota, we have had a lot of flooding. In other parts there is severe drought. And all producers are facing economic losses because prices don't cover our costs. During the 1980s farm financial crisis, a lot of farms and main street businesses were lost. Help came but it was too late. The next big crisis began in 1998. Congress took immediate action and prevented devastation, showing an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Beyond the farm bill, there are lots of other issues impacting producers. We have a record trade deficit of $32 billion. The U.S. used to always run a surplus. We need new trade agreements to open up foreign markets. We should not cede world markets to countries with poor environmental and labor standards, especially to our adversaries. We need to promote biofuels like ethanol, which are good for the environment, jobs, and family pocketbooks. Rules implementing sustainable aviation fuel tax credits, CAFE standards, and other flawed regulations are locking out American farm families from offering proven solutions while extending these opportunities to Brazil and China. I will close with this thought. We are experiencing unprecedented rates of hunger. American farm and ranch families are the solution to this crisis. A USDA official told us by 2050 there will be ten billion people on the planet. He also added that we will need to plow up all of the world's forest land to feed everyone. That sounds ominous, but we have been here before. In the 1970s, we faced the same grim news, but an Iowa farm kid named Dr. Norman Borlaug, whose statue is in the Capitol Rotunda, said America's producers got this and we did. Secretary Vilsack honored Dr. Borlaug for saving billions of lives and millions of acres of pristine forest land. We can do it again, but we need good policies to help us. We put everything on the line for a thin and often negative margin. Young people aren't going into farming, and that is why the average age of farmers is nearing 60. Farmers love their kids, as all parents do, and no parent wants their kids to go through life facing constant worry. We need full-time farm and ranch families. We also need Washington to make the right decisions to help producers defeat hunger both at home and abroad. Thank you for the opportunity to testify.  Prepared Statement of Dana Allen-Tully, Ph.D., President, Minnesota Corn Growers, Eyota, MN Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member Scott, and Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me to testify before you today. My name is Dana Allen-Tully and my family and I own and operate a diversified family farm near Eyota, Minnesota where we produce dairy, corn, soybeans, and alfalfa. I also have the honor of serving as the President of the Minnesota Corn Growers Association, representing about 7,000 farm families across the state. I'd like to begin by thanking each of the Members of this Committee for making the decision to serve on the Agriculture Committee and for the work that you do every day to promote our nation's farm and ranch families, our rural communities throughout the country, and all the people and places positively impacted by the farm bill and the many other policies under your jurisdiction. Thank you. Earlier this month, a national news outlet afforded me the opportunity to explain to its readers why passing a stronger farm bill this year is so important to farm families like ours. My aim here this morning is not to discourage you, but I do feel it's important to provide a glimpse into the economic landscape that producers are facing right now. Unless conditions change, I believe we're heading into a perfect storm, a storm that I don't think will be fully appreciated until early next year when farmers try to get loans but are unable to do so because they cannot demonstrate the ability to cash flow. There are a myriad of factors contributing to this situation, including plummeting crop prices, very high costs of production, interest rates that have doubled, natural disasters for so many around the country, and tightening credit. Our working capital is fast being depleted. Recent analyses by both the Federal Reserve Bank and the Farm Bureau point to the trouble that is brewing in farm country. And the recent lay-offs of a thousand workers by John Deere is a canary in the coal mine. An extension of the current farm bill will not head off the economic hemorrhaging that is coming. Unfortunately, even a new farm bill with a strengthened safety net may not be timely or sufficient to address the current situation, though this Congress certainly should pass a strong, new farm bill because it would help address the problems over the long term. These economic conditions along with natural disasters may well have been what prompted Senator Martin Heinrich to declare a couple of weeks ago that Congress ``must pass a disaster supplemental as soon as possible''. Recent USDA estimates project that farm income will drastically fall again this year. In fact, from last year to this year, the decline will mark the biggest year-to-year drop ever recorded. Adjusted for inflation, net farm income this year will be down $43 billion, or 27 percent compared to last year, and this comes after a nearly 19 percent drop from 2022 to 2023. All said, net farm income from 2022 to 2024 will have fallen by 40 percent, which is the single largest 2 year drop on record. This helps explain why Purdue University's July Ag Economy Barometer found farmer sentiment sharply declining as farm families are left to wonder how they are going to make ends meet. It also helps explain the increased mental health issues and even suicides we are facing in rural America. To provide a little more color to the economic situation, consider this: The national average corn yield that a farm family would have to make this year just to break even is 219 bushels per acre--which is 27 percent higher than the past 10 year average. For soybeans, it's 56 bushels per acre--or 12 percent higher than the past 10 year average. This is true across the spectrum of commodities grown in every region of the country, whether it's wheat, sorghum, peanuts, rice, cotton, and so on. We're all looking at average losses of more than $150 per acre if crop prices remain at current levels. For Minnesota farmers, the loss per acre is actually projected to be even higher this year.

So, I know this is a bit sobering but the truth is, our farm and ranch families across the country are going to need help. The good news in all of this is that this Committee and Congress are uniquely positioned to offer a hand. What specifically can you do? First, putting aside whatever other issues may divide you, the Commodity Title and Crop Insurance provisions included in the farm bill this Committee passed are excellent and would go a long, long way in helping producers around the country, including in states like Minnesota. The Commodity Title in the House farm bill in particular provides a meaningful safety net and it's my sincere hope that it makes the final cut in whatever Congress sends to the President's desk for signature. The $4.10 PLC/ARC reference price is well below what we requested based on costs of production but it represents a 40 per bushel increase and, along with the reference price escalator, it should help carry us through to better times, at least in the long run. It also improves the revenue thresholds for ARC, and with the increased trigger to 90% of the previous 5 year average, we see a very tangible and significant increase in support ahead. This is especially important now given current conditions. Corn Cost of Production vs. Price  I also greatly appreciate your work to update pay limits and AGI and to ensure that eligibility requirements do not lock out farm families likes ours from a safety net. Although my parents, brother, husband, and I all work on our farm, we needed help and so we've found a couple of terrific beginning young farmers to join us. They're not technically our family but we certainly regard them as family and we hope that the farm bill will always ensure that farm families like ours are not penalized. If Congress and USDA want beginning young farmers, allowing these kinds of apprenticeships are vitally important. Please strongly support these provisions and principles in the next farm bill because this Committee did a great job in responding to the needs of all producers, all regions, and all commodities, especially in the face of tight budget constraints. Thank you. If the Senate Committee could arrive at a bipartisan bill sometime yet this month, perhaps that could diffuse the more controversial issues and put the wind at the sails of getting a new farm bill done this year. We have to work for this, we have to hope for this--necessity is the mother of invention. Second, urge USDA to resume making ERP payments for 2022. In Minnesota, we did pretty well in 2022 in terms of a crop but we did have pockets of losses. Two years is a long time to wait for relief-- it's time to get those payments to farm families in need. And, third, as I mentioned earlier, Senator Heinrich has called on Congress to pass a disaster supplemental. In Minnesota, we've had lots of flooding and lots of production losses this year. I know in other parts of the country, it's just the opposite where drought continues to grip them. But, across the country, it's the same in terms of economic losses: the prices we are receiving for what we produce simply cannot cover our costs, and this is especially true in areas hit by natural disasters. It's also particularly true for those who rent land, and for young and beginning farmers. Even if you were able to pass a new farm bill this year that included the exceptional Commodity Title you wrote, because support for crop year 2025 will not be provided until October of 2026, for many the help may well come too late. So, please watch agriculture's economic conditions closely in the coming months and if things do not turn around, please consider a supplemental with near- term assistance for production and economic losses alongside enacting the farm bill. I would just add that while I was a little too young to remember the 1980s farm financial crisis, I heard a lot about it from my mom and dad and from my grandparents. A lot of farms went under during those years and a lot of store fronts on main streets shuttered because of it. Even the big cities felt the negative economic impacts, especially cities like Minneapolis and Chicago. Help eventually came but it was too late. I am old enough to remember the next big crisis in farm country which began in 1998--corn prices fell below $1. In that instance, Congress stepped in and took action. Not only did you see producers through to better times but the positive impact you had on agriculture and main street helped offset the economic impacts that the crisis hitting the manufacturing sector was having at the time. So, an ounce of prevention is certainly worth a pound of cure based on this experience. Beyond the need to shore up the farm safety net over the short and long term, there is a whole host of issues impacting your farm and ranch families that I'd like to talk with you about more. For example, we have a record trade deficit of $32 billion this year. Historically, U.S. agriculture always had a trade surplus. We need to turn this situation around by starting to negotiate new agreements that will open up foreign markets to U.S. agricultural goods. We can't afford to cede world food needs around the world to other countries with poor environmental and labor standards which are also often our enemies on the global stage. Over the course of my lifetime, I've also been excited as a girl growing up on the farm, thinking about all the good we can do producing biofuels like ethanol--and we are doing a lot of good for the environment, for jobs, and for family pocket books. But unfortunately, rules implementing Sustainable Aviation Fuel tax credits, new CAFE standards, and other flawed regulations are wrongly locking farm families like mine from providing proven solutions. As just two examples: It's very hard to believe that someone in a position of authority actually believes that a smaller CO2 footprint could result from hauling ethanol clear from Brazil to the United States as opposed to buying ethanol made right here at home. And, allowing what's being called ``used cooking oil'' to be shipped from China in vessels burning bunker fuel to qualify for renewable diesel tax credits for which U.S. grown crops do not qualify makes zero sense. Certainly, when Congress was debating these provisions, lawmakers did not intend for the benefits of U.S. tax credits to benefit foreign actors over domestic producers. Again, there are so many other issues making it an uphill challenge for farm and ranch families--and that's what 98 percent of us are: family farmers and ranchers--not corporations. Not hardly. But I will close with another statement made by Senator Heinrich a couple weeks ago: ``We are experiencing unprecedented rates of global hunger.'' I have no doubt that this is true, and I want to be a part of the solution to this very tragic, unnecessary, life-threatening issue. Last year, when I visited USDA, an official there told us that come 2050, there will be ten billion people on the planet. And, he added, we will need to put under the plough every inch of forestland in the world today if we are to feed everyone--that is, unless we can produce a lot more with less land, less water, less inputs. That sounds ominous. But Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Scott, Members of the Committee, we have been here before. In the 1970s, we faced the same grim forecast, but an Iowa farm kid named Dr. Norman Borlaug--whose statue is in the Capitol Rotunda--came along and said America's farmers and ranchers can do this. We can produce more with less and feed everybody. Secretary Tom Vilsack, a fellow Iowan, rightly honored Dr. Borlaug not long ago for not only saving billions of lives around the world but for also saving millions of acres of pristine forestland. We can do it again. We must do it again. But we have to have policies in place that reflect the realities of farming today. The stakes of farming are so incredibly high--higher than I ever remember them to be. We are putting everything we have on the line every single year for very thin and often times negative margins. Is it any wonder then why the average age of farmers is nearing 60 years old? Farmers love their kids like all parents, and no parent wants their kids to go through life in a constant state of worry that they will work their life away and risk losing absolutely everything. Please don't get me wrong. I absolutely love farming. I love everything about it. And if one day I can't make it, I hope I will look back as I should with gratitude and no regrets. To me, it will all have been worth it. But, that's a very tough proposition for people and that's why young people aren't going into farming anymore. And this is not just a problem for farm families who want to keep doing what they do--it's a real problem for the country and the world, most especially for those who already struggle to put food on the table for their families. We need full time farm and ranch families to stick with it. I hope you do not mind the passion with which I offer this testimony but this all means so much to me and we need Congress and the Administration to make the right decisions if we want to avoid doubling down on world hunger and even hunger here at home. Thank you very much for the opportunity to offer testimony before you this morning. I'm very grateful to each of you for your time and attention and I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have. The Chairman. Thank you, Dr. Allen-Tully. Mr. Dunlow, please begin when you are ready. STATEMENT OF DAVID DUNLOW, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN COTTON PRODUCERS; PRODUCER DIRECTOR, NATIONAL COTTON COUNCIL, HENRICO, NC Mr. Dunlow. Good morning. My name is David Dunlow, and I farm in Gaston, North Carolina. I currently serve as the Chairman of the American Cotton Producers. My wife Deborah and I have three children, and my son William and I have farmed 3,800 acres of cotton, peanuts, soybeans, corn, and wheat, mostly on rented land. In North Carolina, production costs are all well above market price. There is not a single commodity I produce that will cash-flow. I and other southeastern producers are hanging on by a thread. Our industry has heard from lenders across the country who have seen producer equity erode, and without Federal assistance this year, many of these lenders will no longer be able to finance growers. I have never experienced a worse time in my 40 years of farming, and the stress has taken a toll on my health as I wonder how our operation will survive. In previous years when market prices were below cost of production, growers could benefit from the Commodity Title to offset losses. However, that is no longer the case. The reference price established back in 2018, long before the disruptions of COVID, has not kept pace with inflation, rendering the safety net ineffective today. The results have been back-to-back years of losses on our farm, and next year could be just as bleak. Over my career, I have been able to purchase several small farms. Now, I have been forced to refinance all these farms to pay my operating debt from last year. Because of our deteriorating financial condition, I have not found any traditional lenders willing to fund our operation. We must rely on an operating line of credit from a private equity-funded institution at a higher than market interest rate. We have also been unable to afford the enormous cost of upgrading our farm equipment. In 1990, the cost of a new cotton picker was around $40,000, and the price of cotton was around 74 a pound. Today, a new cotton picker is $1.1 million, and cotton is still trading in the low 70 nearly 35 years later. It is the dream of my son William to one day take over my farm and oversee the operation on his own. However, William is forced to diversify his income to support his family. William's two sons Hank and Clyde love being on the farm with their granddad. I hope my farm can continue to sustain itself so that one day Hank and Clyde can have the option to take over. We all talk about new farmers. I gave my future son-in-law Peyton, who has an agricultural degree from NC State, an opportunity to work on the farm. However, after having discussions with my daughter, he decided to seek employment elsewhere due to the lack of profit provided by our operation. In closing, I want to commend the Committee for advancing a bipartisan farm bill that addresses the significant challenges of all growers. The bottom line is producers need real relief before the end of this year. We can't wait any longer. Members of Congress must understand that another straight extension of the current law is unacceptable. Without support in 2024, I may no longer be able to farm. Many others are in the same situation. Thank you for the opportunity to testify, and I would be pleased to respond to any questions.  Prepared Statement of David Dunlow, Chairman, American Cotton Producers; Producer Director, National Cotton Council, Henrico, NC Introduction My name is David Dunlow, and I am a farmer from Gaston, North Carolina. I currently serve as a Producer Director with the National Cotton Council (NCC) and as Chairman of the American Cotton Producers (ACP). I also previously chaired the ACP's Farm Policy Task Force, working closely with Congress on the creation and implementation of the seed cotton program for U.S. producers. I am the grandson of a sharecropper, and I worked under my father on his farm operation throughout my younger years. I obtained my first farm loan in 1985 and farmed alongside my father until his death in a farming accident in 1992. Today, my wife, Debra, and I have three children. My son William and I farm 3,800 acres of cotton, peanuts, soybeans, and wheat, mostly on rented land. The NCC is the central organization of the United States cotton industry. Its members include producers, ginners, cottonseed processors and merchandisers, merchants, cooperatives, warehousers, and textile manufactures. A majority of the industry is concentrated in 17 cotton- producing states stretching from California to Virginia. U.S. cotton producers cultivate between 10 and 14 million acres of cotton, with production ranging from 12 to 20 million 480lb bales annually. The downstream manufactures of cotton apparel and home furnishings are in virtually every state. Farms and businesses directly involved in the production, distribution, and processing of cotton employ more than 87,000 workers and produce direct business revenue of more than $23 billion. Annual cotton production is valued at more than $6.0 billion at the farm gate, the point at which the producer markets the crop. Accounting for the ripple effect of cotton through the broader economy, direct and indirect employment surpasses 265,000 workers with economic activity of almost $75 billion. In addition to the cotton fiber, cottonseed products are used for livestock feed and cottonseed oil is used as an ingredient in food products as well as being a premium cooking oil. Economic Conditions on the Farm The U.S. cotton industry continues to be burdened by increased production costs, sluggish consumer demand, and supply chain challenges. Since passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, market conditions for cotton producers have dramatically changed. World cotton mill use is more than 2 million bales lower than in 2018, and U.S. cotton's export share has fallen by seven percentage points, while Chinese polyester production has increased by over 35 million bales. Combined Brazilian and Australian cotton production has nearly doubled over this same period, as a more favorable regulatory environment, efficiency improvements, and new investments in infrastructure have allowed these nations to expand their industries and supplant U.S. cotton export share. This foreign competition, along with an increasingly difficult regulatory environment in the U.S., has made it hard for me to stay in business. This issue is not unique to cotton. Where I farm in North Carolina, production costs as it relates corn, peanuts, and soybeans are all well short of market prices. There is not a single commodity that I producer that will cash flow. I attended a meeting with Southeastern producers last week, and the sentiments are the same. Growers are hanging on by a thread. I have heard from lenders across the country who have seen producer equity erode and without Federal assistance this year will no longer be able to finance their growers moving forward. On a personal level, standpoint, I am facing a second consecutive year in which market prices are well below production costs. This is simply not sustainable. In previous years, when market prices were below costs of production, growers could benefit from the farm bill's commodity title payments, such as those provided by the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) program, to offset losses. However, that is no longer the case. The PLC program's reference price, established back in 2018-- long before the disruptions of COVID--has not kept pace with inflation, rendering it ineffective today. The net result for me personally has been several years of losses on our farm, severely eroding our equity. I have never known a worse time in my 40 years of farming, and the stress has led to personal health issues as I wonder how our operation will survive. Inputs such as labor, supplies, equipment, parts, fuel, land rent, fertilizer, and seed have skyrocketed. Some of these expenses have nearly doubled, and my margins have narrowed over the last several years. Things have gotten so bad that these days a bumper crop is required just to break even. Over my career, I have been able to purchase several small farms, totaling roughly 600 acres. Now I have been forced to refinance all these farms to pay farm operating debt. However, because of our deteriorating financial condition, I have not found any traditional lending institutions willing to fund our operations. Instead, we have had to rely on an operating line of credit from a private equity-funded institution at a higher-than-market interest rate. We have also been unable to upgrade farm equipment, leading to higher repair bills that increase our overall production costs. New equipment, which would help me to remain competitive, is cost- prohibitive. In 1990, the cost of a new cotton picker was around $40,000, and the price of cotton was 74 . Today, a new cotton picker is $1.1 million, and cotton on the December 2024 futures market is still trading in the low 70 nearly 35 years later. It is the dream of my son William to one day take over my farm and oversee the operation on his own. However, William is forced to diversify his income to support his family. William's two sons Hank and Clyde love being on the farm with their ``Pap'' and father. I hope my farm can continue to sustain itself so that one day Hank and Clyde can have the option to take over the farm. However, that dream of mine and William will never be a reality if economic conditions do not improve and assistance is not provided. I also gave my future son-in-law Peyton, who has an agriculture degree from North Carolina State University, an opportunity to work on the farm. However, after discussions with my daughter he has decided to seek employment elsewhere due to the lack of profit provided by our operation. The bottom line is we need a new farm bill this year. While I understand that political realities may prevent a new farm bill from being sent to the President's desk, Members of Congress must understand that another straight extension of the current farm bill is unacceptable. An extension without additional financial support to producers only extends the misery, and many farmers like me and others across the country will not be farming next year without some sort of assistance. 2024 Farm Bill I want to commend this Committee for passing the Farm, Food, and National Security Act on a bipartisan basis. The legislation contains many of the NCC's farm bill priorities, including an increase in the ARC/PLC reference price and improved access to area-wide crop insurance products, such as the Supplemental Coverage Option (SCO) and the Enhanced Coverage Option (ECO), which function similar to the Stacked Income Protection (STAX) program. The bill also, modernizes USDA's marketing assistance loan (MAL) program and strengthens support to the U.S. textile industry and Pima cotton producers. Since 2018, cotton costs of production have increased by 24%. When converted to a seed cotton basis, the reference price of 36.7 falls well short of current costs. The House Agriculture Committee provisions to increase the reference price to $0.42 will provide a PLC safety net more in line with costs of production and extend a vital financial lifeline to producers who are currently unable to make ends meet. Like almost all farmers, I am diversified and all crops need an enhanced safety net. Though the PLC increases in the House bill vary by commodity, when I pencil it out on my farm, they all seem consistent relative to cost of production for each commodity. Most importantly, increasing the reference price will also give lenders confidence to continue to finance producers across the Belt. Cotton producers have overwhelmingly selected the PLC program, with more than 90% of seed cotton base acres enrolled under this option. The reference price increase in the Committee-passed farm bill provides support at a level that will reassure lenders. In addition, growers enrolled in the ARC/PLC programs are currently limited in their access to crop insurance due to a prohibition on the purchase of STAX on their enrolled farms. STAX is a crop insurance product for upland cotton that provides coverage for a portion of a producer's revenue based on the county, or area-wide, experience. While the Farm, Food, and National Security Act maintains the prohibition on simultaneous enrollment in STAX and PLC, it makes SCO function more like STAX while maintaining a grower's ability to enroll in PLC. This change will allow growers to tailor their risk management options according to their needs while also decreasing their reliance on ad hoc programs, putting producers in charge of their own production risks. The upland cotton non-recourse MAL program is a cornerstone of the U.S. cotton industry, ensuring the efficient movement and orderly marketing of cotton. We are grateful the House Agriculture Committee saw fit to raise the loan rate to $0.55, which would put growers very close to triggering a marketing loan gain or a loan deficiency payment (LDP) due to the rapid decline in the cotton market. The Farm, Food, and National Security Act also makes a number of important modernizing reforms to the MAL program by allowing storage credits to better reflect actual storage charges; determining a globally competitive Adjusted World Price (AWP) based on three international prices and establishing a 30 day window for finalizing the AWP. If these reforms were in place today, growers would have already triggered much-needed marketing loan gain or LDP payments. Extra-long staple (ELS), or Pima, producers, like upland growers, have also experienced sharp increases in production costs in recent years, with current costs exceeding the safety net provided by the loan program. The NCC is grateful that the House Agriculture Committee has addressed deficiencies in the ELS safety net by increasing the ELS loan rate to $1.05 and adding ``marketing loan'' functionality to the ELS loan. In my home state of North Carolina and other parts of the Southeast, the textile industry is a vital part of our rural economies, thanks in large part to the Economic Adjustment Assistance for Textile Mills (EAATM) program, originally authorized in the 2008 Farm Bill Receipts must agree to invest EAATM proceeds in equipment and manufacturing plants, including construction of new facilities as well as modernization and expansion of existing facilities. EAATM funds have allowed investments in new equipment and technology, thereby reducing costs, increasing efficiency, and allowing domestic mills to be more competitive with foreign mills. This was shown to be prophetic during the COVID-19 pandemic as the U.S. textile industry was able to quickly shift their manufacturing facilities to the production of personal protection equipment (PPE). In addition, the industry continues to be a critical supporter of products to our defense industry. Make no mistake, maintaining the production and growing consumption of cotton here in the United States is a vital part of our national security. We are grateful to the Committee for increasing the EAATM rate to $0.05 per pound on every pound of upland cotton consumed. This will provide essential support at a critical time for an industry that continues to withstand apparel imports below cost of production and the devastating impacts of the de minimis loophole in Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930. I also want to thank the Committee for increasing the commodity title payment limits and indexing them to inflation. Current payment limit policies do not reflect the scale of production agriculture necessary to be competitive and viable in today's global market. Artificially limiting benefits only punishes a producer like me and others who are in vital need of support to be able to continue farming. It also provides a disincentive to make further investments in my operation and undermines a U.S. producer's ability to compete in a global market. Conclusion In closing, I want to commend the Committee for advancing a bipartisan farm bill that provides long-term stability and addresses the significant challenges all growers are facing across the country. We now need to get this bill or similar legislation signed into law as soon as possible, so farmers like me receive some relief before the end of this year. Without support in 2024, I may not be able to speak with you a year from now as an active producer. Other growers in my region and across the country are in the same situation, and many of these successful producers run family farms that have been in operation for multiple generations. The NCC looks forward to working with the Committee and all commodity and farm organizations and other stakeholders to get the Farm, Food, and National Security Act across the finish line. Thank you for the opportunity to testify, and I would be pleased to respond to any questions. The Chairman. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Dunlow, much appreciate your testimony and just kind of laying out the implications. Votes were called at 10:22. We are going to recess the Committee at this point. My apologies to the witnesses. That constitutional responsibility to vote kind of gets in the way of really good work. We will be back. After the fourth vote, we just ask everybody to come back because we will resume promptly after the fourth vote. The first vote is 15 minutes. The remaining three are 5 minute votes. So the Committee is in recess.  The Chairman. I appreciate everybody's patience with that interruption for votes. We will reconvene the Committee here. And Mr. Hotchkiss, please begin with your testimony when you are ready. STATEMENT OF ANTHONY ``TONY'' W. HOTCHKISS, CHAIRMAN, AGRICULTURE AND RURAL BANKERS COMMITTEE, AMERICAN BANKING ASSOCIATION, EVANSVILLE, IN Mr. Hotchkiss. Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member Scott, and Members of the Committee, my name is Tony Hotchkiss, and I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak today. I am the Chairman of the American Bankers Association Agricultural and Rural Bankers Committee, and I am testifying in that capacity today. I have 41 years of agricultural banking experience, the last 10 as director of agriculture for Regions Bank, from which I recently retired. Before Regions, I worked in a number of community banks helping to lead their ag lending. I was raised in Iowa, and like many ag bankers across this country, I grew up watching, learning, and working for family and friends who were farmers and ranchers. Ag bankers have a deep appreciation for the important role producers play in our economy and the unique challenges they face. I appreciate the opportunity today to present the views of the American Bankers Association on financial conditions in farm country. Banks continue to be one of the first places that farmers and ranchers turn when looking for agricultural loans. Our agricultural credit portfolio is very diverse. Banks finance large farms, small farms, urban farmers, beginning farmers, women farmers, minority farmers. To bankers, agricultural lending is good business, and we make credit available to all who can demonstrate they have a sound business plan and the ability to repay. With our deep connection to farmers and ranchers, banks are often the first to see changes within balance sheets and cash- flows on the farm operation often due to changing economic conditions. Today, I would like to outline the current state of the agricultural economy as it relates to our customers and opportunities in which Congress could offer solutions which would reduce stress on all borrowers and lenders. With rising input costs and lower commodity prices, farmers and ranchers have worked through the liquidity and working capital they built up over the past few years at a more rapid pace than anticipated and are now beginning to leverage equity through refinancing debt. This has made agricultural bankers feel like they are looking over a cliff in regards to the agricultural economy. For example, we are hearing that bankers already are starting to refinance debt for almond growers in California, and we are hopeful this is an outlier and not a growing trend. The challenge with refinancing is that, with low commodity prices, the cash-flow is challenged to even meet the new payment requirements of the refinanced debt. As has already been mentioned, the USDA is projecting net farm income to drop approximately 25 percent from 2023 to 2024. Some regions of the country will feel the effects sooner than others, but all will feel it. Based on this, the trend of refinancing debt may become more commonplace and more challenging as lenders and producers work together to bridge the low prices we are experiencing in ag commodities. Changes are needed to government policy to combat a slowing agricultural economy. The 2024 Farm Bill provides many of the needed changes. An increase in the FSA guaranteed loan limits is very good, improvements to the Downpayment Assistance Program is very good, and the revised definitions for who qualifies for beginning farmer and rancher programs is also good and were all ABA priorities that were included in the 2024 Farm Bill. Additionally, changes to reference prices, dairy programs, crop insurance, and Farmer Mac are all supported by agricultural bankers. I would like to thank this Committee for the tireless work they put in to pass the bipartisan legislation out of Committee. Agricultural bankers do believe there are some additional farm bill provisions that could be added in the future. This includes the creation of a national process for FSA guaranteed loan programs to speed up the loan-making process, and also opening Farmer Mac up by removing the cooperative lender requirement for energy project loans. Beyond the 2024 Farm Bill, there are many provisions within tax reform that are vitally important to agriculture, banks, and their customers such as carrying on the current estate tax exemptions and capital gains exemptions for agriculture. The Access to Credit for our Rural Economy Act of 2023 (H.R. 3139), better known as ACRE Act, is tax legislation that would create a level playing field for all lenders to agriculture. ABA analysis has shown that the ACRE Act would result in a 50 to 100 basis point reduction in interest rates for qualified borrowers. Farm banks are healthy and continue to be forward-looking, growing capital and increasing reserves. Bankers are proud of the work we do to support our nation's farmers and ranchers. The ag community is a critical part of our economy, and America's banks remain committed to serve it through good times and bad. Thank you very much for this opportunity. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.  Prepared Statement of Anthony ``Tony'' W. Hotchkiss, Chairman, Agriculture and Rural Bankers Committee, American Banking Association, Evansville, IN Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member Scott, and Members of the Committee, my name is Tony Hotchkiss. I am the current Chairman of the American Bankers Association's Agricultural and Rural Bankers Committee and testify in that capacity today. I have worked in agricultural banking for 41 years, including the past 10 years as Director of Agriculture for Regions Bank based in Clayton, Missouri, from which I recently retired. Before Regions, I worked at a number of community banks helping to lead their agricultural lending. Agricultural bankers have a deep appreciation for the important role producers play in our economy and the unique challenges they face. I appreciate the opportunity to present the views of the ABA on Financial Conditions in Farm Country. The American Bankers Association (ABA) is the voice of the nation's $24 trillion banking industry, which is composed of small, regional and large banks that together employ approximately 2.1 million people, safeguard $19 trillion in deposits and extend $12.4 trillion in loans. ABA is uniquely qualified to comment on agricultural credit issues as banks have provided credit to the agriculture industry since the founding of our country. At year-end 2023, 3,808 banks--83% of all banks nationwide--reported agricultural loans on their books with a total outstanding portfolio of more than $198.6 billion. The Farm, Food, and National Security Act of 2024 (H.R. 8467), commonly known as the ``2024 Farm Bill'', includes comprehensive risk management tools for farmers and ranchers, loan guarantees for agricultural loans, rural development projects, nutrition support and investments in conservation. Banks play a critical role in rural America, and this legislation provides a vehicle for the banking industry to help meet the financial needs of farmers, ranchers, and agricultural communities across the country. The meaningful changes proposed in the 2024 Farm Bill will allow bankers to better serve their customers and ensure they have high levels of credit availability in the years to come. Introduction The ABA commends the Committee for including many of our priorities in this important legislation,\1\ including modernizing the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) loan guarantee limits, clarifying bona fide operator rules for beginning farmer programs, modernizing and raising limits for the down payment assistance program, and providing robust risk management tools that allow our customers to have greater stability and predictability for each growing season. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ https://www.aba.com/-/media/documents/advocacy/what-we-stand- for/2023-aba-farm-bill-priorities.pdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Banks continue to be one of the first places that farmers and ranchers turn when looking for agricultural loans. Agricultural credit portfolios among banks of all types are very diverse--banks finance large and small farms, urban farmers, beginning farmers, women farmers and minority farmers. To bankers, agricultural lending is a productive way to serve our communities by doing business the right way: we make credit available to all who can demonstrate they have a sound business plan and the ability to repay. With our deep connection to farmers and ranchers, banks are often the first to see changes within balance sheets and cash flows on farm operations, often due to changing economic conditions. In 2023, farm banks--banks with more than 14.32 percent of their loans made to farmers or ranchers--increased lending by 6.7 percent to meet the rising needs of farmers and ranchers, and now provide $110 billion in total farm loans. Farm banks are an essential resource for small farmers, holding more than $44.6 billion in small farm loans, with $9.2 billion in micro-small farm loans (loans with origination values less than $100,000). Farm banks are healthy, well-capitalized, and stand ready to meet the credit demands of our nation's farmers large and small. In addition to our commitment to farmers and ranchers, thousands of farm dependent businesses--food processors, retailers, transportation companies, storage facilities, manufacturers, etc.--receive financing from the banking industry as well. Agriculture is a vital industry to our country, and financing it is an essential business for many banks. Banks work closely with the FSA to make additional credit available by utilizing the Guaranteed Farm Loan Programs. The increased loan limits on FSA guaranteed loans is the right policy to ensure more credit availability to farmers and ranchers. Additionally, entities like Farmer Mac provide another avenue for banks to increase credit availability. By purchasing guaranteed loans from banks, Farmer Mac allows banks to lower interest rates for their customers and provide better loan products. Our nation's farmers and ranchers are a critical resource to our economy. Ensuring that they continue to have access to adequate credit to thrive is essential for the well-being of our whole nation. America's banks remain well equipped to serve the borrowing needs of farmers of all sizes. In my testimony today I will elaborate on the following points: b Banks are a primary source of credit to farmers and ranchers in the United States. b The Agricultural Economy is Experiencing Headwinds. b The 2024 House Farm Bill provides needed changes to the Credit Title including increased limits for the FSA Guaranteed Loan Programs, changes to the bona fide operator definitions, and needed changes to Farmer Mac eligibility. b There are still changes needed to help producers better receive agricultural credit. The passage of the Access to Credit for our Rural Economy (ACRE) Act would provide more competition for agricultural lending and lower the costs for producers. I. Banks Are a Primary Source of Credit to Farmers and Ranchers in the U.S. For many of ABA's members, agricultural lending is a significant component of their business activities. ABA has studied and reported on the performance of ``farm banks'' for decades and, we are pleased to report that the performance of these highly specialized agricultural lending banks continues to be strong. ABA defines a farm bank as one with more than 14.32 percent farm or ranch loans (to all loans). Farm Banks Exhibit Solid Farm Loan Growth  Source: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation & American Bankers Association Analysis. At the end of 2023, there were 1,442 banks that met this definition. Farm lending posted solid growth over the year. Total farm loans at farm banks increased by 6.7 percent to $110 billion in 2023 up from $103.1 billion for these banks in 2022. Approximately $1 in every $3 lent by a farm bank is an agricultural loan. Farm production loans grew at a faster rate than farm real estate loans. Outstanding Farm production loans rose by 10.0 percent to $45.9 billion. Farm real estate loans grew at a pace of 4.5 percent to a total of $64.1 billion. Farm banks are a major source of credit to small farmers--holding more than $44.6 billion in small farm loans (origination value less than $500,000) with $9.2 billion in micro-small farm loans (origination value less than $100,000) at the end of 2023. The number of outstanding small farm loans at farm banks totaled 639,694 with over half--373,353 loans--with origination values less than $100,000. Farm banks are healthy, well capitalized, and stand ready to meet the credit demands of our nation's farmers large and small. Equity Capital Increases at Farm Banks  Source: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation & American Bankers Association Analysis. Equity capital at farm banks increased 14.0%, or $5.8 billion, to $47.2 billion in 2023. Meanwhile, tier-1 capital increased by 6.8%, or $3.4 billion, to $53.7 billion.\2\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \2\ Equity capital is invested capital; it consists of the funds invested in a bank on a long-term basis. Such capital is obtained by issuing preferred or common stock or retaining a portion of earnings. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aggregate tier-1 leverage ratios \3\ increased 30 basis points (bps) in 2023 to 10.6%. Aggregate tier-1 capital ratios (assessed on risk-based assets) fell slightly to 14.48%, down 2 bps from 2022 indicating that farm banks are still well capitalized.\4\ Farm banks' median tier-1 leverage ratio remained 69 bps above where it was before the start of the Great Recession. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \3\ Tier-1 leverage ratio is Tier-1 capital divided by total average assets for leverage capital purposes. \4\ In 2023, 668 farm banks opted into the community bank leverage ratio and did not report risk-based capital ratios. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In 2020-2021, banks experienced an unprecedented influx of deposits, alongside a pullback in loan demand. This led many banks to increase their holdings of long-term assets such as Treasury securities. When the Federal Reserve began rapidly raising the Federal funds rate over the course of 2022, the market value of those bonds fell in the rising interest rate environment. Under tangible capital calculations, unrealized gains and losses are recorded as though the bank intends to sell those securities immediately at market value. This volatility in market valuations can distort assessment of a bank's financial health; post Dodd-Frank, regulatory capital has replaced equity capital as a reliable measure of the capital available at banks to absorb shocks. Farm banks have built strong, high-quality capital reserves and remain liquid and prepared to manage potential economic headwinds. II. The Agricultural Economy is Experiencing Headwinds The agricultural economy is in a position it has not been in for many years. There is a return to the cyclical agricultural conditions that were present before the surge of government support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising input prices, combined with lower commodity prices, have resulted in USDA projecting a 25% reduction in net farm income in 2024 compared to 2023. Agriculture commodities fall from 2022 high Key agricultural commodity prices are off their recent highs. Fertilizer prices were a big concern after the invasion of Ukraine; while prices have softened, reflecting weakness in the agriculture sector, farmers' margins are under pressure from lower crop prices and higher overall price inflation.  Source: Bloomberg. With rising input costs and lower commodity prices, farmers and ranchers have worked through the liquidity and working capital they built up over the past few years at a more rapid pace than anticipated. As a result, farmers and ranchers are naturally turning to credit to finance their agricultural operations. This has resulted in increased debt levels for agricultural producers across the country. Bankers believe they may be `looking over a cliff' in regard to the agricultural economy without changes to current government policy. This includes adjustments to reference prices and ensuring that crop insurance covers loss appropriately for producers. Additionally, bankers desire a faster payment system in the event of natural disasters. Waiting over a year to receive disaster payments can create unnecessary credit crunches, that ultimately hurt agricultural producers and their access to credit. III. The 2024 Farm Bill Has Great Improvements to Credit Availability for Rural America The 2024 House Farm Bill makes important improvements to the credit title that will increase credit availability in rural America. ABA has long advocated for the changes that were included in the legislation. The most significant change is the increase in the FSA Guaranteed Farm Ownership Loan Program to $3.5 million and the FSA Guaranteed Farm Operating Loan Program to $3 million. As the cost of agriculture continues to increase, it is vital to have the FSA loan programs keep pace with modern agriculture. These new limits will achieve that goal. As supported by ABA, the bill also makes improvements to the down payment assistance program by removing arbitrary cap on the size of the loan and instead caps down payment loans at 45% of the lesser of acquired price or appraised value. The bill also includes a revised definition of owner-operator that allows for various business structures to increase eligibility to beginning farmer guaranteed loan programs to more producers and customers. The bill expands options for the Agricultural Mortgage Secondary Market (Farmer Mac) by allowing guaranteed loans under the 9007 Rural Energy for America program to be eligible. The legislation also provides flexibility on farm structure acreage caps by allowing the Farm Credit Administration (FCA) to establish alternative loan amount limitations to reflect the treatment as a qualified loan or a moderately sized agricultural mortgage loan, as determined by the FCA, accounting for adjustments in geographic differences and valuations. I would like to thank Congress for these changes within Farmer Mac. Farmer Mac is a valuable tool in the toolbox for agricultural bankers because it provides another avenue for banks to increase credit availability. By purchasing guaranteed loans from banks, Farmer Mac allows banks to lower interest rates for their customers and provide better loan products. ABA still believes a needed change for Farmer Mac is to remove the cooperative lender requirement for energy loans to be sold to Farmer Mac. This limits the ability for banks to participate in rural energy projects, ultimately limiting available credit in rural America.

Lastly, there are many provisions within the 2024 Farm Bill to speed up the USDA loan approval process while making it easier for producers to use USDA loan programs. ABA is supportive of these measures. It should be noted that the language to modify the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's 1071 Final Rule reporting requirements for the Farm Credit System is problematic for the banking industry. ABA supports efforts to provide relief from the 1071 Final Rule, but that relief should be equal across all lenders. IV. The Access to Credit for our Rural Economy Act ABA is a proud supporter of H.R. 3139, the Access to Credit for our Rural Economy Act (ACRE Act). The ACRE Act has been introduced by Representative Randy Feenstra (R-IA) and Representative Wiley Nickel (D-NC). This legislation will help to lower lending costs for farmers, ranchers, and rural communities. ACRE would remove the taxation on income earned from interest on agricultural real estate loans, and for loans for rural residences in a population area of less than 2,500 people with a mortgage value of less than $750,000. By removing this taxation, banks will be able to lower their interest rates, which helps to lower costs for borrowers. ACRE will be beneficial to both new and existing farmers by lowering interest rates on agricultural real estate. However, access to credit can be much more difficult for ``Beginning Farmers and Ranchers'' and ``Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers'' due to a lack of preexisting land ownership and access to other sources of capital--54% of young farmers say they need more land. ACRE will help new farmers and ranchers by lowering their costs to acquire land which is the most capital intense portion of any farming operation, and a critical asset to achieve long-term, reliable access to credit. Lastly, ACRE will reduce the need for farmers and ranchers to find off-farm income by reducing interest payments, which increases the cash-flow from their operation and reduces the need for off-farm income. It has been estimated that ACRE will deliver approximately $950 million in annual interest expense savings for loans secured by farmland. ACRE will also provide much needed access to credit for rural home mortgages. According to the 2020 Census, rural America lost population over the last decade for the first time in history. Additionally, rising interest rates are putting homeownership out of reach for many rural Americans. Current interest rates for rural mortgages are averaging 7.5%. ACRE is estimated to lower those interest rates between 50 and 100 basis points--bringing interest rates down to 6.5% to 7% from 7.5%, or possibly more. This will result in approximately $450 million in interest savings annually to homeowners. The U.S. Census lists 17,113 communities with a population of less than or equal to 2,500. In 2021, $58.1 billion in bank mortgages were originated in these communities--a need that is only increasing. Given a conservatively estimated 3% growth, approximately $60 billion in rural mortgages will qualify for ACRE in 2023. Enacting ACRE will help provide the additional access to credit that is needed for rural communities to thrive. Conclusion The banking industry is well positioned to meet the needs of U.S. farmers and ranchers. Rising input prices and declining commodity prices, however, have resulted in lower net farm income for agricultural producers. Moreover, debt levels have been increasing, and bankers are concerned that without changes to government policy, agricultural producers may experience a tightening of credit availability. The 2024 Farm Bill and the ACRE Act provide opportunities to make the changes necessary to provide the credit needed for farmers and ranchers to successfully navigate tougher economic times. Bankers continue to see great opportunities in agriculture and will continue to stand with farmers and all our partners in agriculture going forward. We will also continue to work constructively with the Committee and your colleagues in Congress on the 2024 Farm Bill and ACRE Act to help ensure that farmers have the needed credit to be a successful and a strong part of the U.S. economy. Thank you for the opportunity to express the views of the American Bankers Association. I would be happy to answer any questions that you may have. The Chairman. Mr. Hotchkiss, thank you so much for your testimony. Now, Mr. Caldwell, please proceed when you are ready. STATEMENT OF JOSEPH ``JOEY'' G. CALDWELL, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR RETAIL, GreenPoint AG HOLDINGS, LLC; BOARD MEMBER, AGRICULTURAL RETAILERS ASSOCIATION, DECATUR, AL Mr. Caldwell. Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member Scott, and Members of the House Agriculture Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify regarding the financial conditions in farm country and their impacts on rural economics. My name is Joey Caldwell. I am the Senior Vice President at GreenPoint Ag. We are a farmer-owned agricultural input supplier serving farmers in rural communities in the southern U.S. Basically, we supply farmers what they need to grow crops that feed, clothe, and fuel our nation and beyond. We supply crop nutrition, seed and crop protection products. We also provide a variety of services from agronomic and precision technology advice to application services. We do this in conjunction with our farm cooperative partners at Alabama Farmers Co-op and Tennessee Farmers Co-op. I lead our retail division that has over 85 locations across ten states. Basically, if the SEC plays football there, we are likely there, too. I also appear before you today on behalf of the Agricultural Retailers Association board of directors and as the son of a proud west Tennessee farmer. This year will be my dad's 62nd crop. When I graduated college in the early 1980s, the farm economy was so bad it could barely support my dad, mother, three brothers, and me. However, this led me to a fulfilling career in supporting the American farmer. At GreenPoint, we are in the farmer success business. We know that if the farmer isn't successful, the ag supply chain will not be successful. We believe that strong farmers make strong families. Those strong families make for strong rural communities, and it is those communities that help make the fabric of this great nation. While farmers are a fiercely resilient and independent bunch, it takes a whole lot of people working together to get them what they need, including you all. Farmers need a strong farm bill. Most importantly, they rely on the certainty crop insurance and price support helps provide. I know that many of you know this. I know many of you care deeply about rural America. I know there are a lot of pieces that go into legislation of this size. But I also need you to know that what matters to farmers and their communities is the certainty that the farm bill brings. Farmers have a critical need for that certainty. Farming isn't like other professions. If I make a mistake in this role, my company may suffer, and if that mistake is bad enough, I could lose my job. That would be hard, but I could start over. Farming is different. When a farmer plants a crop, they put more than just their job at risk. Their farm is their home, their livelihood, and pillar in their community. For many, it is also their family legacy, something passed down to them over the generations that they hope to pass down to their kids. If they make too many mistakes or the markets move against them too badly, they risk losing it all. When I consider financial conditions and the farm economy's impact on rural communities, the first word that continually comes to mind is uncertainty. I look forward to discussing with you today why that uncertainty continues to hinder progress in our business and how it can be remedied. For starters, a new farm bill helps provide certainty about the risk well beyond the control of the farmer. Weather destroys crops, and we all know that the changing weather is increasing those risks. Without this farm bill, the risk may become too great, eventually putting farmers and rural communities where they live in dire straits. We are facing rapidly declining commodity prices and inflation that has driven up the expenses of farm equipment and crop inputs. Farm incomes are off nearly 50 percent from the last 2 years. The ag economy and the American rural communities helped found this country, and we need help now. I was glad to see this Committee pass a bipartisan farm bill, and I urge Congress to pass it and help provide more certainty. Thank you for all your work in helping keep the American farmer and our rural communities strong. I look forward to your questions.  Prepared Statement of Joseph ``Joey'' G. Caldwell, Senior Vice President for Retail, GreenPoint Ag Holdings, LLC; Board Member, Agricultural Retailers Association, Decatur, AL Introduction Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member Scott, and distinguished Members of the House Agriculture Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify regarding the financial conditions in farm country and their impacts on rural economies. My name is Joey Caldwell and I serve as Senior Vice President for Retail for GreenPoint Ag. We are a farmer-owned agricultural input supplier, resulting from three financially strong businesses coming together to better serve farmers and rural communities in the Southern U.S. GreenPoint Ag was founded in 2020, through a joint venture of our parent companies, including Alabama Farmers Cooperative (AFC), Tennessee Farmers Cooperative (TFC), WinField United, Tipton Farmers Cooperative, Farmers Inc., and Tri-County Farmers Association. We are a top wholesale and retail agronomy company, servicing farms and rural businesses with crop nutrients, crop protection, seed and professional products. We also offer seed treatment, field scouting, soil sampling, tissue sampling, custom application and a full array of ag technology services. We do this in conjunction with our farm cooperative partners at Alabama Farmers Co-op and Tennessee Farmers Co-op. I lead our retail division that has over 85 locations across ten states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee and Texas. We are headquartered in Decatur, Alabama. I also appear before you today on behalf of the Agricultural Retailers Association (ARA), where I currently serve on the Board of Directors and as the son of a proud west Tennessee farmer. This is my Dad's 62nd crop and my 42nd. I'm not a farmer today because when I graduated college in the early 1980's, the farm economy was so bad, it could barely support my dad, mother, my three brothers, and me. At GreenPoint, we're in the farmer success business. It is our mission to help our customers succeed in this ever-changing world. As with all of us in the U.S. supply chain, we only succeed if the American Farmer succeeds. We achieve this through delivering profitable customer solutions through trust-based relationships. We believe that strong farmers make strong families, and those strong families make for strong rural communities. It is those communities that help make the fabric of this great nation. It is, of course, in our interest, as well as the interest of the nation and its consumers, to have a solid safety net for producers in the farm bill and for that, I commend Chairman Thompson and the Members of this Committee for passing the Farm, Food, and National Security Act of 2024 through Committee. When I consider financial conditions and the farm economy's impact on rural communities, the first word that continually comes to mind is uncertainty. I plan to discuss today why that uncertainty continues to hinder progress in our business. The Burdens of Uncertainty As you know, the uncertainty that burdens the agricultural economy is also driven by weather events. With business locations in ten states, our customers are susceptible to a myriad of conditions and are not immune to any economic impact seen in their aftermath. In many instances the disaster relief dollars allocated by Congressional authority can help those affected rebuild and recover. These are obviously unforeseen circumstances. There are, however, some economic stressors we see coming long before their impact is felt by GreenPoint Ag, other ag retailers and input suppliers, and ultimately the grower. The rising cost of doing business and inflationary pressures are chipping away at farmers' margins. It is for this reason, that passing a farm bill, sooner rather than later, will lighten this burden of uncertainty. Areas of Significant Uncertainty The largest issues of uncertainty in the ag retail space include financing risks, regulatory burdens, energy policy, the Tax Code, and labor markets. I will quickly touch on each and offer suggestions for how these burdens can be lightened. Financing Issues Customer service is paramount to our business and a key to your success. This theme carries over into all aspects of GreenPoint Ag, especially credit and finance. Our retail locations are staffed with experienced salespeople to custom tailor not only a fertilizer, crop protection, seed and technology program for customer operations, but also create finance plans to fits their needs. With several financing options, varying interest rates and terms, we have options for everyone. Regulatory Issues The regulatory whiplash our industry has felt over the past 2 decades was significant. The EPA needs a scientifically sound, predictable process for pesticide registrations. This is crucial for consumers, the environment, registrants, farmers, and ag retailers. Uncertainty about rules, product availability, and last-minute label changes complicates stocking and usage decisions for retailers and producers. EPA decisions should rely on comprehensive, high-quality scientific data and analyses that go beyond mere correlations. Issues in this area have led to the loss of valuable products with no suitable replacements, and unjustified label changes for long-used products. While we commend the EPA for addressing ESA compliance, the current Endangered Species Act work plan needs further adjustments to avoid major disruptions to agriculture. Ag retailers and Certified Crop Advisors should be involved in developing pesticide mitigation measures, and EPA's methodology should account for regional practices. Stakeholder engagement, especially with farmers, is vital throughout the registration and review process. Energy Issues The Biden Administration's climate policies have increased costs for crop inputs in agriculture. Higher natural gas prices have made nitrogen fertilizer more expensive, while rising diesel prices have elevated transportation costs for products to farms and the operation of agricultural equipment. Diesel, crucial for ag retailers, grain shippers, and farmers, now costs significantly more. Additionally, diesel-powered irrigation systems, plastics for crop protection products, and packaging for food producers have all seen price hikes. These increased energy costs have, in turn, raised the overall price of feeding and fueling the nation. Tax Issues Section 199A--established under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act-- ensures that agricultural cooperatives and other pass-through businesses can utilize similar tax deductions as corporations that benefited from the corporate tax rate reduction. This tax provision has been instrumental in helping farmer cooperatives and their member- owners invest in their operations, and weather business challenges driven by a global pandemic, geopolitical conflict, supply chain constraints, and record inflation. Our nation's agricultural producers face unique challenges and risks as they strive to feed the globe, and extending these tax provisions will remove a critical piece of uncertainty as producers start planning future investments for their operations and rural communities. While this issue doesn't necessarily fall under the direct jurisdiction of this Committee, this tax provision is an absolutely critical tool for agriculture and rural America. Allowing Section 199A to expire will effectively raise taxes on agricultural cooperatives and their farmer-owners. We thank all the Members who have cosponsored the Main Street Tax Certainty Act, which would permanently extend the Section 199A provision. Labor Issues Finally, I would like to thank this Committee for their work on the Agricultural Labor Working Group. We need ag labor reform! Uncertainties in the agricultural labor market have significantly contributed to rising costs in agriculture. Labor shortages, unpredictable immigration policies, and fluctuating wage rates have made it challenging for farmers to secure a reliable workforce. These issues have increased labor costs and disrupted planting, harvesting, and processing schedules. We are approximately 2.5 million workers short of the necessary levels to meet production needs. To adjust to the instability in the ag workforce, farmers are forced to find costly alternatives that increase operational expenses, which are often passed down the supply chain, leading to increased prices for consumers. Agricultural workers here on H-2A visas help fill the void. The instability in the labor market also forces farmers to invest more in automation and technology, further driving up costs in the agricultural sector. The ag industry will benefit from this Committee taking the time to address these issues; and the impact will be significant. Conclusion Agriculture is often the backbone of rural economies. When farmers struggle, local businesses that depend on their spending--such as equipment suppliers, retailers, and service providers--also suffer. Reduced farm income can lead to job losses not only in farming but also in related industries like food processing, transportation, and retail. In turn, lower tax revenues from struggling farms and businesses can result in cutbacks in essential public services like education, healthcare, and infrastructure maintenance. All of these things are intertwined throughout our country but are significantly more apparent in rural communities because of the lack of other industries to help support local revenue streams. Implementing supportive agricultural policies that provide financial assistance, subsidies, and crop insurance to farmers can help stabilize farm incomes and reduce uncertainty. As I said earlier, I commend this Committee for their commitment to move the Farm, Food, and National Security Act of 2024 earlier this summer, and I urge the full House body and your Senate colleagues to follow your lead and pass a farm bill before the end of the year. The time to act is now. Thank you for your continued commitment to supporting America's farmers and rural economies. I look forward to your questions. The Chairman. Mr. Caldwell, thank you very much for your testimony. Dr. Rainey, please proceed when you are ready. STATEMENT OF RONALD RAINEY, Ph.D., ASSISTANT VICE PRESIDENT, PROFESSOR, DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE; DIRECTOR, SOUTHERN RISK MANAGEMENT EDUCATION CENTER, UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS, LITTLE ROCK, AR Dr. Rainey. Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member Scott, and Members of the Agriculture Committee, I thank you for this opportunity to testify on this important process that means so much to our farmers and ranchers and our rural communities. My name is Ron Rainey, and as an agricultural extension economist with the University of Arkansas, I will highlight three areas of concern impacting financial conditions in farm country. That is low profit margins, limited crop insurance understanding and options for some producer segments, and the magnified impacts of the current environment on our small, marginalized, and beginning farmers. Farmers across the country continue to adapt to the challenging agricultural environment made worse by the relatively high input prices, the historically low commodity prices, and the current relatively high interest rates. The current environment has placed increasing pressure on producers' balance sheets, forcing them to increase farm debt levels as they attempt to survive the current economic challenges. Across all ag sectors and types of production, farm profitability remains a challenge. The issue is magnified even more for our small, historically underserved, and marginalized farmers because they have somewhat limited access to many of the farm safety net triggers, either because of a lack of historical production, limited additional financing options, and/or limited access to Federal crop insurance. USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service releases monthly indexes for input prices paid and output prices received. These indexes include collecting survey responses for output and input price for agricultural production, crops, livestock, and food commodities. The spread between these two indices often helps understand where farmers are getting price squeezed and how their profit margins are impacted. Current farm income instability from inflationary pressures, high interest rates, and several supply chain disruptions are forcing farmers to pay higher input costs while receiving lower commodity prices. In my submitted testimony, I submitted figures 1 and 2, which is an analysis that compares the annual index value from 2022 to 2024 for two indices, crop prices received and input prices paid with 2011 as the base year, which was a good year. There is a circle in that figure 1 highlighting the beginning of a divergence that began between input/output prices, which started in 2013. Since then, we have seen a major divergence in the two indices with the widest gaps being between 2014 to 2020. From 2021 to 2022, we saw both indices increase, but the gap remained, and the divergence has grown even wider in 2023 and 2024 due to declining commodity prices. In response to this profitability squeeze, farmers have been increasing debt levels. A recent article from Kansas City Fed details recent changes in farm debt levels and highlights increased debt levels, especially among small- and mid-size farms. The article details steady increases in farm debt at commercial banks, mostly by continuing growth in farm operating debt. The solid development and farm operating debt in the first quarter signals an increase in farmers' financing needs. Additionally, many specialty crop producers have limited crop insurance options. The number of Federal crop insurance products available for producers has expanded risk-mitigating options in recent years, whole farm revenue, dairy margin, livestock, pasture, and forage, to name a few. However, gaps in coverage remain as you examine Risk Management Agency's business summary across all products. Many marginalized producers are only aware of the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program, NAP, which is available through USDA's Farm Service Agency. Additional training is needed to improve farmer and rancher understanding and use of these products. Last, I just want to highlight USDA program historical equity issues and access issues have played a role in limiting the opportunity for many of our small, specialty crops, socially disadvantaged farmers to gain economies-of-scale, increasing their farm size and investing in innovative or new machinery and/or technology. The lack of opportunity to scale up and invest results in lower productivity and relatively higher input cost on average. This results in even tighter profit margins in this current profit-squeezing environment. Additionally, many of our new and beginning farmers are seeking innovative business models to grow their businesses that leverage new technologies to grow their farm businesses using new processes, engaging in such things as urban agriculture, value-added processing and production, and local and regional food systems. Therefore, I encourage you to look across the spectrum of farm businesses and business models to explore opportunities to support other historically underserved sectors who are facing these same tight profit margins. Thank you.  Prepared Statement of Ronald Rainey, Ph.D.,\1\ Assistant Vice President, Professor, Division of Agriculture; Director, Southern Risk Management Education Center, University of Arkansas, Little Rock, AR --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ Authors: Ronald Rainey, Ryan Loy, and Hunter Biram, are Professor, Assistant Professor and Assistant Professor with the University of Arkansas' Division of Agriculture. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- My name is Ronald Rainey, and I am humbled to provide input into this important, deliberative process that means so much to all of our farmers, ranchers, and rural communities. I have over 3 decades of experience working primarily as an Extension Agricultural Economist with the University of Arkansas, our state's flagship, Land-Grant University. I currently serve as Assistant Vice President of the Division of Agriculture and Center Director for the Southern Risk Management Education Center, which serves 13 states and two territories in the Southeast United States. My testimony is based on anecdotal evidence and comments from producers and leadership efforts developing and implementing regional and national risk management technical assistance. My University of Arkansas co-authors are agricultural finance and agricultural policy specialists. Current Economic Update on Agriculture Farmers across the South continue to adapt to the challenging agriculture environment made worse by relatively high input prices, historically low commodity prices, and current relatively high interest rates. The current environment has placed increasing pressure on farmer/rancher's balance sheets, forcing them to increase farm debt levels as they attempt to survive the current economic challenges. The gap between the prices farmers receive and the prices that they are paying for inputs forces farmers to strategically manage their balance sheets (increasing farm debt levels) to survive. Across our small- and mid-sized farms and many of our large-scale commercial operations, farm profitability remains a challenge. The issue is magnified for small, historically underserved and marginalized farmers because they have somewhat limited access to many of the farm safety net triggers either because of a lack of historical production, limited additional financing options, and/or limited access to Federal crop insurance products. The current relatively higher interest rate market makes seeking additional financing a risky and costly tactic to manage the current market situation. Additionally, many producers have limited options beyond their balance sheets to manage the added risks. Many specialty crop producers have limited crop insurance options. The number of Federal crop insurance products available for producers has expanded risk mitigating options in recent years: whole farm revenue, dairy margin, livestock, forage, to name a few. Still, gaps in coverage remain as you examine Risk Management Agency's business summary across all products. For example, the poultry sector--which is the largest single agricultural industry in many southern states--is dominated by contract production. Contract growers have virtually no access to insurance products. Additionally, many marginalized producers are only aware of the Non-insured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) available through USDA-Farm Service Agency. The Crop Insurance Navigator program, a regional Risk Management Agency (USDA-RMA) pilot project (https://srmec.uada.edu/navigator.html) across the southeast region is currently highlighting the Federal crop insurance gaps in understanding, access, and service for marginalized and small farmers/ ranchers. The Navigator project reveals that even where newer insurance product offerings are available, a lack of understanding on the functionality of a number of these more specialized products is a persistent problem. Additional training is needed to improve farmer and rancher understanding and use of these products. There also appears to be training needs for insurance companies and agents on the array of available products to serve small, specialty crop producers, and historically underserved. Some producers complain about the lack of a company/agent offerings in terms of a desired insurance product(s) as well as a lack of engagement with certain producer groups. Some of the limited engagement seems to occur from a specialization within the crop insurance companies. If an insurance company's portfolio of clients in a particular region is made up primarily of large-scale commercial row- crop farms, agents/companies appear to have little incentive to cultivate business among small, specialty crop, and/or livestock producers, particularly on products for which sales or underwriting procedures are more difficult, such as whole farm revenue or micro-farm insurance. Current Market Challenges--Tightening Farm Profit Margins The United States Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service (USDA-NASS) releases monthly indexes for input prices paid and output prices received. These indexes include collecting survey responses for output and input prices for agricultural production, crops, livestock, and food commodities. The spread between these two indices often helps understand where farmers are getting price squeezed and how their profit margins are impacted. Current farm income instability from inflationary pressures, high interest rates, and several supply chain disruptions (e.g., the Russian-Ukraine war and Panama/Suez Canal) are forcing farmers to pay higher input costs while receiving lower commodity prices, emphasizing the need to consider these indexes into the future. These price indices measure the change in prices paid (and received) relative to a point in time--2011 in this case (Figure 1). The base year is often chosen during a time without prevailing inflation or major supply chain disruptions (Schulz, 2022). 2011 was a good year for agricultural production and profitability. As such, using 2011 as a base year is a way to highlight how better or worse-off agricultural producers are compared to a good year. Figure 1 compares the annual index value from 2000-2024 for the two indices with 2011 as the base year. The price received index in 2012 was 102.8%, meaning that the crop price received, on average, in 2012 was 2.8% higher than in 2011 (base year = 100%). The  circle in Figure 1 shows the beginning of a divergence between input and output prices. In 2013, when writing the 2014 Farm Bill, the index for input prices paid was almost exactly the index for output prices received. This is where most of our current farmer safety net support stems from, and since then, we've seen a major divergence in the two indices, with the widest gaps between 2014-2020 (USDA-NASS). From 2021-2022, we saw both indices increase, but the gap remained, and the divergence has grown wider in 2023 and 2024 due to declining commodity prices. Figure 1. Crop Output Prices Received vs. Input Prices Paid  Source: Loy, Ryan, and Hunter Biram. 2024. Another way to view the indices is to calculate how they change year to year. Figure 2 plots the same indices as Figure 1 but shows the yearly change between the index values. Using this percentage change helps producers understand (1) the volatility of crop output prices and (2) the magnitude of change as compared to the previous year. A key takeaway is that input prices are less volatile (in terms of yearly % change) than output prices. Secondly, the percentage change in crop output prices between 2023 and 2024 (^13.8%) is much larger than the percentage decrease in input prices (^1.38%) during that period. Without any relief in the form of improved crop prices received, figure 1 suggests farmers will continue to suffer from cost/price squeezes and eroding profit margins. Further, figure 2 shows the magnitude of that spread between the indices in Figure 1; if input and output prices continue this trajectory, an improved farm safety net will be warranted. This will be at the forefront of every producer's mind, with ongoing farm bill debates in 2024. Figure 2. Year-over-Year % Change in Input and Output Crop Prices  Source: Loy, Ryan, and Hunter Biram. 2024. A recent article (Francisco Scott and Ty Kreitman ) detailing recent changes in farm debt levels highlights increased debt levels specially among small- and mid-sized farms. The article details steady increases in farm debt at commercial banks bolstered by continued growth in farm operating debt. While the observed peaks are relatively lower than early 2023 observations, the growth in real estate debt remained robust. The solid development in farm operating debt in the first quarter signals an increase in farmers' financing needs. While the current interest rate market helps farmers finance this uptick in demand for loans, the rates reflect higher cost risk management options for farmers and ranchers. The considerable growth in agricultural production loans increased farm debt balances. Figure 3 details farm debt levels from 1970-2024 for commercial banks. As noted in the referenced article, the growth in agricultural debt was concentrated among small- and mid-sized farm lenders. Three quarters of the $15 billion increase in farm debt was attributed to banks with agricultural loan portfolios less than $500 million. Non-real estate farm loans at commercial banks ended the first quarter nearly 15% higher than a year ago, the largest increase since the late 1970s. The rapid increase in operating debt boosted total agricultural debt even as farm real estate debt increased only modestly. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- https://www.kansascityfed.org/research-staff/francisco-scott/. https://www.kansascityfed.org/research-staff/ty-kreitman/. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Figure 3.

Under this authority NIFA partners with four regional Extension Risk Management Education (ERME) Centers to carry out a national competitive grants program in Risk Management Education to educate agricultural producers about the full range of risk management activities. The Southern Risk Management Education Center (SRMEC) at the University of Arkansas has been a part of ERME since 2009, serving 13 states and 2 territories--the Southern Region. SRMEC's goal is to Empower Producers to Manage Risks. The Center strives to improve producers' ability to manage risk and increase profitability of southern agriculture by delivering programs designed to change risk management behavior among key producer populations. The ERME authorizing language has been amended through successive legislation, namely the 2008, 2014, and 2018 Farm Bills. As amended, the language describes the purpose of this risk management partnership as ``educating agricultural producers and providing technical assistance to agricultural producers on a full range of farm viability and risk management activities, including futures, options, agricultural trade options, crop insurance, business planning, enterprise analysis, transfer and succession planning, management coaching, market assessment, cash flow analysis, cash forward contracting, debt reduction, production diversification, farm resources risk reduction, farm financial benchmarking, conservation activities, and other risk management strategies.'' Section 11125 of the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 provides authority for the USDA NIFA to expand the Partnerships for Risk Management Education program to serve a new audience, defined as ``producers that are underserved by the Federal crop insurance program''. ERME implemented the expanded program by offering two separate grant pools within our annual Request for Applications (RFA) that seeks education project proposals: risk management education (our traditional program area), and producers underserved by crop insurance. SRMEC works with a ten member advisory council made up of public and private agricultural stakeholders that are strategically and intentionally engaged to serve our region's diverse agriculture sector--commercial, small, diversified, row-crop, livestock, organic, sustainable, urban, and specialty. Representation includes farmers, ranchers, 1862 and 1890 land-grant university faculty, and community based organization representatives. The Center annually manages $2.5 Million in competitive grants that seek to empower producers to manage risk on their individual operations through educational offerings. To manage our two separate grant pools, SRMEC employs a ten member advisory council and a seven member evaluation panel made up of public and private agricultural stakeholders to identify our grant regional priority areas and capacity building efforts across the region. Additionally our advisory council and crop insurance evaluation panel serve as reviewers for our grants selection process using a transparent merit-based process. In recent years, ERME has been selected to manage additional grant portfolios because of our national program structure, a national program delivered regionally. Those new programs include a one-time meat processing RFA and our just released Technical Assistance Producers Network (TAPN) RFA which seeks to assist financially distressed farmers with assistance to understand and improve USDA Farm Service Agency loan decisions. The TAPN technical assistance focuses on the Southern and Western regions where FSA loan application denials are the highest. This technical assistance effort is funded by USDA-FSA to address limited access concerns and improved customer service issues. The ERME program has delivered technical assistance across the country and effectively engaged all segments that make up U.S. agriculture. The engagement includes working in collaboration with crop insurance sector and USDA agencies as well as funding projects with land-grant universities and community-based organizations. Engagement with Risk Management Agency (RMA) and crop insurance industry The ERME program routinely collaborates with RMA to promote RMA resources and to engage with its regional offices. Both programs collaborated to jointly develop and distribute a primer, Introduction to Risk Management (Crane, Gantz, Isaacs, Jose, and Sharp, 2013). The publication details ERME and RMA's consistent approach to managing risks across five areas: production, marketing, finance, legal, and human. The document not only defines each risk area but details specific tools and strategies to successfully mitigate the unique risks that agricultural producers face. Beyond the publication and on-going communications, each ERME Center has RMA representation on its advisory council. SRMEC has an RMA representative on our Advisory Council and two representatives on our crop insurance evaluation panel. We communicate on program and funding areas to build on the synergies of each program to serve farmers and ranchers. SRMEC actively engages with multiple regional offices and has on-going conversations with RMA administrators on ways to enhance outreach efforts and resources. In addition to the Crop Insurance Navigator program, SRMEC has collaborated on the release of a publication from University of Arkansas, Fundamentals of Federal Crop Insurance. The publication serves as a primer written for farmers/ranchers and their influencers to understand the history and basics of Federal crop insurance. Lastly, SRMEC has on-going conversations with the crop insurance industry-- individual companies, National Crop Insurance Services, and Crop Insurance Professional Association (CIPA)--on ways to collaborate on company/agent trainings. Current Condition for SDFRs The Census of Agriculture reveals that most socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers (SDFRs) on average operate relatively smaller sized farms, thereby leveraging smaller operating loans to produce their crops each year. It should be noted that USDA program historical equity and access issues have played a role in limiting the opportunities for SDFRs to gain economies-of-scale--increasing farm size and investing in innovative or new machinery/technology. The lack of opportunities to scale up results in lower productivity and relatively higher input costs on average. Even when SDFRs participate in USDA farm programs, they receive a disproportionately lower level of Federal support in terms of funds to reinvest in their farms. The cumulative impact of lower support levels over an extended period of time--10 year, 20 year horizon, etc.--results in real differences in terms like the size of operation and equipment/facilities investments. The relatively smaller-sized operations are generally less efficient creating additional hurdles for economic viability. These operations lag their majority farmer investments in precision agriculture technologies and innovative practices because of the relatively tighter profit margins. I serve on the board of directors for the Socially Disadvantaged Farmer and Rancher Policy Research Center at Alcorn State University. The Policy Research Center actively organizes and examines research, data, and producer feedback to provide insights to enhance understanding of SDFR conditions and policy recommendations to enhance their economic viability and survival. The Policy Research Center notes the following discrepancy in risk management/crop insurance subsides. As Federal crop insurance subsidies programs have increased, the ``subsidy gap'' has widened between White and Black farmers. Because crop insurance subsidies are based on the value of a producers' crop, the larger subsidy premiums go to producers with the highest sales. The vast majority of farmers that receive the highest subsides are White. Another issue that continues to plague SDFRs is real and perceived trust issues resulting from current/past experiences and on-going confrontations. For example, there are a number of producers who refuse to enter a USDA office even in 2024 because of fear-based on experiences--of disparate treatment, losing their land or being foreclosed on a loan under perceived less than fair conditions. Therefore, the ability to build and restore trust and relationships is a critical hurdle to effectively reach marginalized producers and their communities with USDA programs/resources. The resulting community impact of inequitable access to Federal and state programs have played a significant role in individual and community wealth levels across both urban and rural areas. Multiple high-poverty rural regions-- Arkansas/Mississippi Delta, Alabama Black Belt, etc.--traces their roots back to the great depression and the initial farm legislation which introduced the allotment programs which literally took and/or reduced acreage from many minority producers.\2\ The resulting historical Federal policies and their implementation through local county committees results in present-day inequities among base acre allotments today for many minority producers. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \2\ Agricultural Adjustment Act (1933) (https://en.wikipedia.org/ wiki/Agricultural_Adjustment_Act), Agricultural Adjustment Act Amendment of 1935 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Agricultural_Adjustment_Act_Amendment_of_1935), Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act of 1936, and Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_Adjustment_Act_of_1938). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In terms of risk management technical assistance, my experience with managing education projects--ERME projects; Agricultural Finance, Tax, and Asset Protection Program (https://agftap.org/), and Crop Insurance Navigator project--reveals that technical assistance in record-keeping, price risk management (understanding and use of futures markets), business planning, and tax preparation are core areas to build and maintain viable businesses. These fundamental processes are directly linked to credit access and indirectly linked to the use of crop insurance. Additional technical assistance in these core areas could enhance producer understanding of ways to leverage crop insurance products to support their businesses. Overview of working with 1862, 1890 Land-Grants & Community-Based Organizations As SRMEC director, I have been privileged to work with a collection of public and private agricultural stakeholders assisting our farmers and ranchers across the region and nationally. SRMEC has intentionally engaged with diverse stakeholder groups to build meaningful relationships across not just the entire region but also the diverse farm types and producer backgrounds. We collaborate annually with 1890 Extension and outreach specialists, small farm program (2501) directors, and community-based organizations that serve an array of producer groups ranging from African American, Native American, Hmong, Organic, Sustainable, Livestock, Row-Crop, Greenhouse & Nursery, to name a few. Within the 1862 land-grants, we collaborate with the region's farm management committee--Southern Extension Economics Committee. The committee is made up of agricultural economists from the region's land-grant institutions, primarily those with Extension responsibilities. Annually, the Center supports the region's premiere academic outreach meeting, the Southern Outlook Conference, which is hosted by Southern Extension Economics Committee. SRMEC features its collaborations with the farm management committee and 1890 partners on our website, https://srmec.uada.edu/. Lastly, SRMEC partnered with the Agricultural and Food Policy Center at Texas A&M to lead a collaborative effort among the Southern Extension Economics Committee to launch Southern Ag Today (SAT), https://southernagtoday.org/. SAT provides daily insight and analysis on issues impacting Southern farmers and producers and is a timely resource for anyone--farmers, ranchers, Extension educators, lenders, policy makers, and media--who wants a better understanding of the issues affecting agriculture in the region.

Thank you, Dr. Rainey, and thank you to all of our witnesses for your important testimony today. At this time, Members will be recognized for questions in order of seniority, alternating between Majority and Minority Members and in order of arrival for those who joined after the hearing convened. You will be recognized for 5 minutes each in order to allow us to get to as many questions as possible. I now recognize myself for 5 minutes. As many of you know, there are outside voices and even some Members of this Committee who have tried to stoke a regional battle over the Farm, Food, and National Security Act. This analysis relies upon isolated comparisons of only reference prices to say the bill favors southern commodities while ignoring other provisions such as enhancements to ARC, the addition of base acres, or the affordability of crop insurance, all of which overwhelmingly benefit Midwest producers, not to mention policies outside of our jurisdiction such as tax credits and biofuels mandates, which primarily accrue benefits to certain commodities over others. For those of us that were around in 2014, no one benefits when commodity groups start fighting one another, and the Committee tried to carefully weigh all these factors rather than cherry picking certain provisions. So for the producer witnesses, Dr. Allen-Tully and Mr. Dunlow, when you assess the cost of production for commodities on your farm and the suite of Federal policies, farm bill- related and otherwise, how do you assess the various provisions of the bill this Committee advanced in May? And how do the improvements compare to the current law and the alternative proposed by Chairwoman Stabenow? So we will start with Dr. Allen-Tully. Dr. Allen-Tully. Thank you, Chairman Thompson. Minnesota corn strongly supports the House-passed farm bill. We would find that the increase in reference price for corn, the increase of 40 would be a meaningful increase. We asked for more, but we understand that there are other things that need to be weighed. We also are very grateful for the improvements in the crop insurance title, as well as doubling the funding for MAP and FMD. There were investments made in the research title as well and access to voluntary incentive-based conservation. So we are very happy with the bill that you passed out and understand that that will provide a meaningful improvement in our safety net. The Chairman. Well, thank you very much. Mr. Dunlow? Mr. Dunlow. Yes, sir. Thank you. As I mentioned earlier, just the cost of production and where we are at with the 2018 Farm Bill, it is just not working, not giving us any support. The provisions in the new farm bill certainly meet a lot of our needs, but keeping in mind the new provisions still do not guarantee us a profit. That is not what it is there for. Referring back to my 40 year career, the farm safety net has always been there. When things get bad, it catches you, lets you weather the storm sort of speaking. But the way things are set up now, the farm bill is working is we are facing a category 5 hurricane. It is just not helping at all. So the new provision, new farm bill will be very beneficial to us. Thank you. The Chairman. Do either of you to have any insight in terms of comparison with the ideas that have been put forward in the Senate for comparison? Mr. Dunlow. Not 100 percent familiar with that version, but I do know it doesn't meet as many of our needs. Reference prices for one are still low enough to where, even if that was implemented, we would still have massive loss under that provision. The Chairman. Dr. Allen-Tully? Dr. Allen-Tully. Yes, we believe that all commodities are in the same boat, and our cost of production have all gone up since 2018. And so a reference price increase for all commodities is important, and agriculture sticking together is critical to us moving the farm bill forward. The Chairman. Yes, going back, it has been since 2002 that the last investment was made in to Title I, and the erosion that has occurred, somewhat on purpose with previous farm bills between 2002 and now where there was a significant amount of money taken away from the safety net and put into conservation, put into nutrition. But, quite frankly, we are not going to have nutrition if we don't have farmers. So thank you very much, and I now recognize the Ranking Member for 5 minutes of questions. Mr. David Scott of Georgia. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Allen-Tully, let me ask you, I am very concerned, as you heard from my opening statement, about the CCC remaining and being helpful to our farmers. It has done magnificent work. So tell me, did you or farmers in your area receive payments from the Administration during the Trump trade war? Dr. Allen-Tully. Ranking Member Scott, yes. I think the vast majority of farmers across the country received payments through the CCC. Mr. David Scott of Georgia. How did those CCC payments impact your ability to move forward? Dr. Allen-Tully. At the time, they were critical to us moving forward. I would say that we would appreciate a strong safety net or a stronger safety net, and so then the possibility of not having to go into the CCC would be more desirable because it would just give us more certainty. So at this point, we are very hopeful that will pass, a stronger safety net so that we have that certainty. Mr. David Scott of Georgia. Yes, it is my hope that our farm bill will take all of this into consideration and show the great value of the CCC program remaining within the hands of whomever is the Secretary of Agriculture. That is what does it. Now, Dr. Rainey, the 2024 Equity Commission final report shared that previous attempts to strengthen the safety net did not directly translate to addressing disparity among producers. So will you tell us more about this disconnect? Dr. Rainey. Yes, so in terms of the previous response to questions of the reference prices, I think that there is needed, but if there is also a provision that talks about updating base acres, but if you don't have base acres, then changing reference prices has no impact of the safety net for you. There are many farmers that are outside of the safety net, and when you look at Federal crop insurance options, there are many farmers not actively engaged in that for a number of reasons, but some of it is an understanding gap. So on the Equity Commission, we just talked about trying to remove some of those hurdles to communicate transparently to allow all segments of agriculture to be seen and to see programs that they can recognize and employ into their business plans. Mr. David Scott of Georgia. And how has this impacted, say, beginning farmers? There are women-owned farms. There are all kinds of people and with certain considerations. How does it impact the vast diversity of ownership of farms? Dr. Rainey. Yes, I would echo that agriculture is extremely important to our rural communities, but it is important to urban communities as well. We see food insecurity across the country. And what COVID taught us in many ways is that our farming communities are a source of resiliency for making communities and areas food-secure, even sometimes replacing some of our large-scale commercial commodity systems that are in place, going from the small farmers that are doing direct marketing at farmers' markets or using the local regional food systems. So the way it plays is that across the spectrum of businesses that make up agriculture, a lot of the farming groups that aren't able to actively access programs to be thriving, become efficient, it creates an added hurdle. One of the advances as an economist is to look at all the technological innovations. We have things like high tunnels, hoop houses, container nurseries where they are changing it that you don't need 1,000 acres to be productive and profitable. But you do need a nice system, and you need people that understand and are willing to finance those systems. So what happens is when they don't get access at USDA, that makes it an added hurdle for financing. It makes it added additional hurdles for trying to help explain maybe a new model that is not a traditional way of looking at it or a traditional way of marketing. And so it just makes it a much more difficult path to walk for all of our producers. And there are some avenues that I think that this Committee can address to help smooth that pathway. Mr. David Scott of Georgia. Well, thank you for that, and thank you for the 20 seconds extra, I appreciate it. Mr. Finstad.  All right. We will go to the Member from Georgia, Austin Scott. Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to just kind of reiterate that agriculture is the number one industry in the majority of states in this country. And even if you are not a farmer, agriculture is important to the economy of your state. And as I look at things right now, the thing that scares me, you have John Deere, the world's largest seller of tractors and crop harvesters--and this is from an article in June--announced that they were laying off 610 production workers. So even if you are not a farmer, if you are one of those 610 workers, the reduction in prices for our commodities is having a direct impact on them and their families. The article states, ``Lower crop prices are leaving agricultural equipment sellers with an excess of unsold tractors and combines, leading some to offer discounts and suspend new orders.'' And it also says, ``The Department of Agriculture has also forecast farm income would slide $25.5 billion from 2023.'' There has been some discussion about the Commodity Credit Corporation. Certainly, when ad hoc payments are made, the Commodity Credit Corporation is used. But wouldn't you agree that farmers would rather have a safety net system that isn't dependent on ad hoc payments to get them through the tough years? Would all of you agree that a good safety net system that doesn't require the ad hoc payments is more important than--and then certainly if we get into situations where you do have to have additional money for the CCC, that is something that can be done. And I noticed, Dr. Allen-Tully, you talked about the trade deficits. We are already in a trade war with a lot of countries. It is not Trump's trade war. It is a war that has been levied against the citizens of America, and Donald Trump is just the first person to respond to it to say if you want fair trade, it is going to be fair trade, and that is a two-way street. So I appreciate you bringing up the fact that we have a trade deficit. But I want to go back to you, Mr. Dunlow. You and I both spoke to cotton producers this past week, and the key question that was asked--and, again, remember that agriculture is the number one industry in the majority of the states out there-- was asked by a producer to a banker at the event that we both spoke at, and his question was, ``If farmers have average yields, what percentage of the farmers will you be able to bank next year?'' Do you remember that question? Mr. Dunlow. Yes, sir. Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. Do you remember the answer from the banker, the ag lender? Mr. Dunlow. Yes, sir. She stated it may be 80 percent of her current producers with an average crop she would be able to refinance for another year, which leaves 20 percent out of business. Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. That won't be farming next year? Mr. Dunlow. Absolutely. Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. And in years gone by, if someone wasn't going to farm, then there was somebody else that was willing to pick up and rent the land. But with the balance sheet changes that we are seeing right now, Mr. Hotchkiss, is it overly optimistic to think that if a farmer isn't able to farm next year, that somebody else is going to step in and rent that property and plant that crop? Mr. Hotchkiss. Thank you for the question. And I don't know if it is overly optimistic. And you are right. There has always been someone that is willing to step up and it has been competitive. But with commodity prices where they are and the inability to be able to grow a crop that you could at least break even, it is going to challenge those that might have picked up those acres in the past. Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. Well, in my state, I mean, bankers are calling me as much as farmers and saying there is not a single commodity that our guys are going to be cash-flow positive on. And if you are not cash-flow positive based on input prices and commodity prices, you certainly don't grow your operation or plant--I mean, David, would you expand your operation right now? Mr. Dunlow. Absolutely not. I mean, me and my son have gone through, and certain farms that are less productive, because we have been forced to lay people off and maybe get rid of some of the less productive land and a lot of things we are doing are just trying to survive. Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. I am almost out of time. Let me end with this. Secretary Vilsack was here February 14. I would hope all of you would watch it. And he said specifically, ``Farm income over the 2021 to 2023 period represents the highest level of farm income in the last 50 years.'' If you listen to Secretary Vilsack, everything is just hunky dory and rosy on the American farm. But I am going to tell you something. There is a big disconnect between what is happening in the ag economy and what our current Secretary of Agriculture thinks is actually going on, on the American farm. Thank you all for being here. Mr. Finstad. We will now go to the Member from North Carolina, Representative Adams. Ms. Adams. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and to the Ranking Member for hosting this meeting. To our witnesses, I thank you for your testimonies on financial conditions in farm country. And I want to extend some special greetings to our North Carolinian Mr. Dunlow on the panel. But before I get to my questions, I do want to raise another financial condition in farm country, which is household food insecurity. It is statistically significantly higher in both rural places and principal cities like Charlotte than the national average according to USDA's Economic Research Service. And so I share that to provide context for the draft farm bill, which passed out of this Committee, which many of you have shared today that there are pieces which you like. But the $30 billion SNAP cut alongside the provisions you highlight today does a disservice to families in farm country who disproportionately participate in the program who cannot afford to put food on the table. So I am hopeful that the conversation today can provoke bringing together a farm bill that builds a bigger tent and can support farmers and families who I know are struggling. And, Mr. Hotchkiss, my first question is to you. You mentioned that it would be problematic for the Farm Credit System to be exempt from the CFPB's 1071 rule on demographic reporting requirements. So could you discuss whether commercial banks are prepared to comply with this reporting? And do you think that a Farm Credit System exemption would disrupt comprehensive data collection that may reveal who is and who is not being served by financial institutions? Mr. Hotchkiss. Thank you for the question, Representative. First of all, yes, commercial banks are prepared to comply with the 1071 rule, and your question regarding Farm Credit and the proposed exemption for them, the reason it is problematic is because it continues to keep an unlevel playing field. And I believe and the ABA believes it should be a one size fits all. Everyone should be held accountable to track and record and report the same information. And by having that carved out and having a different agency, that just becomes suspect and very problematic. Ms. Adams. Thank you. So, Dr. Rainey, thank you for your service on USDA's Equity Commission. But when we talk as if the current financial conditions in farm country are recent, we have to remember that for some Black and Brown farmers, they have been facing headwinds for quite a while. So I just asked Mr. Hotchkiss about the section 1071 rulemaking and the current bill drafts. So how do you think socially disadvantaged farmers would feel about Farm Credit System institutions if they knew that the System could be held to a different and potentially weaker standard for demographic reporting? Dr. Rainey. One of my roles as an educator is working as an advocate, trying to help support more transparent systems. And coming from many of my stakeholders both in industry and farming for minority segments, they have been pushing to get more transparency there because one of the things that is needed in order to drive good results is good data. And if you are limited on the data that you are collecting that you can identify if there are some systemic issues or there are some problems, then it is hard to address it. So I think that many in the minority communities would love to see that transparency, to see that level playing field play out. Ms. Adams. So, Dr. Rainey, this summer I introduced the Capital for Beginning Farmers and Ranchers Act of 2024 (H.R. 8598) with Representative Strickland of Washington, and it authorizes a pilot loan program for beginning farmers to finance startup expenditures and features multiyear repayment terms up to 10 years, as well as reduced collateral interest. So do you see this as a tool that would benefit under-resourced farmers? Dr. Rainey. The short answer will be yes. So financial stress is across agriculture, and because of the systemic issues, I would say that many of our small and marginalized farmers and beginning farmers, it is an added hurdle to even get onto the field if you wish. So any programs that would support financing, financing is the fuel that drives agriculture, so any options that can help and assist in that space would be beneficial. Ms. Adams. Thank you. And thank you all for your testimony and your answers. And I have some others, but I will pass them along. And, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Finstad. We will go to the Member from Nebraska, Representative Bacon. Mr. Bacon. Thank you. Thank you all for being here. We appreciate your testimony and your perspective. Mr. Dunlow and Dr. Allen-Tully, there have been some Members of Congress and even some producers who have suggested that farmers don't need Title I and said insurance is enough to see them through the bad years. Do you agree with this sentiment? I would love to hear your thoughts on it. Dr. Allen-Tully. Thank you. No, we actually would view it as there are two separate roles. Title I is a price support system to help us in times that provides consistency but is well below any cost of production or profitability level. Crop insurance is a tool that each producer can choose to enter into based on their yields and their level of comfort related to risk, and so we view them as separate parts of the safety net but both are critical. Mr. Bacon. Our farmers would be undermined by taking away Title I, bottom line? Dr. Allen-Tully. Yes. Mr. Bacon. Mr. Dunlow? Mr. Dunlow. Yes, I will reiterate what the lady said. We look at it two different ways. For example, on my farm if insurance guarantees, if cotton is at 60 a pound, then I take insurance, I am insured at 60 a pound, which is still well below the cost of production. But with Title I and reference prices, it gives a safety net that helps you weather the storm. In addition to that, it also gives my banker a feeling of comfort, a 5 year farm bill with knowing if things get bad, there are subsidies coming in. Mr. Bacon. Thank you. Mr. Hotchkiss, your testimony touches on how access to credit can be more difficult for young, beginning, and socially disadvantaged farmers. The bipartisan farm bill this Committee passed just a few months ago expands access to the safety net for producers by streamlining credit programs, expanding premium discounts and crop insurance, as well as adding additional base acres. How important will these changes be for those producers who struggle with access to credit? Mr. Hotchkiss. Thank you for your question. All young and beginning farmers, as they enter into the farm industry, there is a high cost of entry. And if they don't enter with a family member, they need these programs so that they can take advantage of the programs, whether it is downpayment assistance or interest assistance or any other USDA program. And so they are absolutely critical in my opinion to allow us to continue to bring in younger farmers and, as I think was said earlier, help the aging--the average age of a farmer ranks 62 this year. We would like to pull that down because we need our farmers to be here a long time so we can feed the world for a long time. Mr. Bacon. You need to get the next generation in, totally agree. Dr. Allen-Tully, one final question back to you if I may. The Draft Herbicide Strategy proposed by the EPA would force growers to adopt costly and burdensome mitigation measures just to use important tools like glyphosate, Dicamba, atrazine to protect their crops from damaging weeds and implement conservation practices. According to the USDA analysis, corn growers in just Iowa, Illinois, and Nebraska could collectively face costs as high as $5.5 billion to comply with this strategy. How do expensive mandates like these impact corn growers who are already struggling to make ends meet? Dr. Allen-Tully. So access to any of our crop protection tools are going to play a critical role in us being profitable, as well as employing any climate-smart programs. And so that is kind of a double-edged sword. If they increase regulation around the crop protection tools that we have, we may not all be able to participate in some of the crop protection or in some of the climate-smart practices that are also becoming clearer and clearer important to our consumers. Mr. Bacon. Thank you. I have 30 seconds left. I think I will yield back. Mr. Finstad. All right. We will go to Representative Spanberger. Ms. Spanberger. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the witnesses for joining us here today. Collapsing on-farm prices, increasing input costs, and tightening margins are straining farmers' financial stability, as you all have so clearly laid out throughout your testimony. In the Commonwealth of Virginia, agriculture is our largest private industry. It contributes significantly to our Commonwealth's rural communities and those communities' overall health, financial health, as well as our overall Commonwealth's economy. The success of family farms translates directly into the well being of local economies through job creation, local spending, and community stability. And protecting family farms is essential for preserving the agricultural way of life, feeding the American people, and making sure that generations can continue to thrive on that land. One of the potential efforts that I have worked on to address some of the financial challenges with Representative LaMalfa, a colleague on this Committee, is the Farm Credit Adjustment Act (H.R. 6564). This bill--and I just highlight it in this hearing because I continue to hear from constituents about the impact it would have--this bill is directly responsive to the concerns I have heard from farmers across Virginia about administrative burdens placed on Farm Credit institutions. Specifically, this bill would cut red tape by allowing the Farm Credit Administration to conduct audits of low-risk Farm Credit institutions less frequently, every 24 months instead of every 18 months. It is common sense. It is just a 6 month extension. It would reduce regulatory burdens, lower costs for Farm Credit institutions, and make sure, frankly, that they have more bandwidth to serve the needs of farmers. So as we continue to look at ongoing critical issues, the way that we are addressing them, I think it is vitally important to continue the conversation related to this bill and the effort that it tries to get at. But I want to begin my questioning talking about some of the challenges facing the farm safety net programs. Currently, the shortcomings of farm safety net programs are increasingly apparent, and again, through your testimony, you have touched on them. With declining direct access from programs like Agricultural Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage and increasing reliance on ad hoc disaster aid, improvements truly are needed to better support farmers. So, Mr. Hotchkiss, I would like to begin with you. Could you discuss about the current state of farm safety programs that have affected agricultural lenders and their ability to support farmers, and if there are any additional changes or improvements that you think that might be needed to make these programs more readily able to support and assist farmers and help stabilize their financial conditions? Mr. Hotchkiss. Thank you for the question. From a safety net perspective, obviously, crop insurance, I believe, is critical. It is part of the farm bill. It is critical both for the farmer and benefits them greatly because it allows them to gain access to credit but it also does give the organization financing them also some comfort because they do have that safety net there. In terms of other issues, the increased limits that are contained for FSA guarantee limits and the separating of the operating loan and real estate loan and increasing them both with the high cost and a continually increasing cost, they are critical not only for existing farmers, but I believe for young and beginning farmers because it gives them the ability to get guarantees with larger operations because of the cost. And then last, the reference prices, you had asked is there something that I can suggest. Reference prices have historically been set once in a farm bill, and I believe with our economy and our world moving at such a rapid pace, almost an annual setting of those reference prices makes more sense because you avoid getting them out of correlation with what is going on in the market. And I also believe that having a correlation to the cost to produce versus the market is really important because there isn't always a strong correlation between that cost to produce and the market price versus what a reference price could do from a safety net perspective. And as has been said by some of my esteemed colleagues here, I believe it is important that farmers can at least break even. Ms. Spanberger. Can you just--in my remaining time--I understand what you are saying. Could you just expand on that a little bit more in terms of what that shift would be that you would recommend? Mr. Hotchkiss. Expand on what specifically? Ms. Spanberger. When you were talking about how--well, two parts. Well, now I am running out of time. But specifically, the annual readjustment that you are---- Mr. Hotchkiss. Well, the reference---- Ms. Spanberger. Would that just not be also highly disruptive? Mr. Hotchkiss. If the reference price would be tied to cost, not commodity market prices, and then either have an annual adjustment tied to those costs or just be reset by the USDA on an annual basis. It could be either one. Ms. Spanberger. Okay. Thank you. That is helpful and interesting. I yield back. Mr. Finstad. All right. We will go to my neighbor from South Dakota, Representative Johnson. Mr. Johnson. Howdy, neighbor. I wanted to talk banking a little bit, and of course, the 1071 is the CFPB's, as you know, sir, their new set of regulations for lenders, pretty broad new data collection. I just want to get a sense because, clearly, capital, as we are talking about people expanding operations, having efficient operations, being able to be sustainable, particularly for young, beginning farmers, I have to think these new regulations have an impact on your ability to put capital out on the street. So talk a little bit about 1071 specifically and if there are other regulations that complicate that flow of capital. Mr. Hotchkiss. Is that directed at me? Okay. I am sorry. Thank you for the question. Complying with 1071 obviously will increase the cost to produce, and those costs will be passed on to the producer. I mean, that is going to happen. And, unfortunately, we don't need additional costs today because we have enough that are already being passed on. The bigger concern I have with 1071 is privacy. In rural America, everyone knows everybody. Your neighbor just said that. And so depending upon how things could be reported to the public, there could be a whole community that know who is being talked about, and they may not want that information now out in the public. And to me, it is an invasion of their privacy, their business' or farm's privacy. And so to me, I am as concerned about that as I am about the---- Mr. Johnson. Well, and you are right. So much of this information is already known. It is even more problematic for the information maybe that the lender doesn't know if the person who is seeking this loan is being asked questions that they think are invasive or inappropriate. Now, you are kind of putting a wedge between this incredibly important relationship between a producer and where they go to get the capital they need to be successful. Am I right in thinking that way? Mr. Hotchkiss. Absolutely. Which is also why, if we do continue to move forward, it should be a level playing field, and everyone that finances in agriculture should be required to ask the same questions because if that doesn't happen, those that don't have to ask those questions are going to have an advantage because that is where the customers are going to go because they don't want to answer. Mr. Johnson. Yes, and I don't want to be blind to history here. I mean, clearly, there have been times where capital has not flown to all communities in this country like it should have. But also, I get concerned when we divide this country into smaller and smaller, more narrow demographic buckets and view us not just as producers who are trying to feed the world, clothe the world, power the American economy, but as subsets of identity groups and this concern that all this data collection is moving us in the wrong direction. What about other regulatory overreach that this Committee should be attentive to? Mr. Hotchkiss. Well, nothing comes to mind specifically. I know that there are some proposals regarding Basel III, and that will continue to increase costs. It is the same type of thing, more cost that will be passed on, and I think that will hurt the American farmer. Mr. Johnson. Well, that was the one I was sort of fishing for. I should have directed you a little bit better rather than make you, but, listen, you grabbed onto it delightfully. I do think this Committee has talked a lot about how those new margin standards could make it a lot harder to deploy capital efficiently and effectively, not just for rural America, but really across this country. I think the Prudential Regulators need to seriously consider the secondary and tertiary impacts of some of these new much higher margin requirements, which, frankly, go way beyond what the stress testing indicates would be reasonable and appropriate in the marketplace. Anything else you want to share before I yield back? Mr. Hotchkiss. I would agree with that comment. That is all I would say. Mr. Johnson. Well, look at this. What a neighborly amount of agreement we have today, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hotchkiss. Well, and I am your neighbor to the south from Iowa, so hi, neighbor. Mr. Johnson. Yes, I think both you guys need to do a better job of taking care of your yard. The neighborhood is going to hell. So with that, I yield back. Mr. Finstad. I am just amazed that you gave this country 44 seconds back, so thank you. We will go to the Member from Connecticut, Representative Hayes. Mrs. Hayes. Good afternoon, and thank you to all of our witnesses for being here today. Before I start my comments, and since the hearing opened talking about the Farm, Food, and National Security Act, I will just make a comment that the fact that we voted on that 2 months ago out of Committee and it has not gone to the floor yet is an indication of how problematic that piece of legislation is. We have 4 more weeks in session before the funding runs out from the extension, so hopefully we can continue to work until we come to agreement and pass a bill out of the full House that the Senate can consider because everyone on this Committee and here in the Congress wants a farm bill that supports our farmers and feeds our families. That is something that I think we all want. But back to today's hearing, according to the 2022 Census of Agriculture, Connecticut, where I am from, and my district, the 5th District, has about 1,251 farms, a decrease from the 2017 Census, which counted about 1,404 farms. The average size of a farm in my district is about 72 acres, more than six times smaller than the national average. This trend holds across the country. The number of farms is declining, and only the largest are surviving. This Committee and the Congress as a whole must work to preserve farms and grow American agriculture, not stand by while more operations close their doors and go out of business. There are inherent risks in farming. I think we can all agree on that. And the success of a farm is dependent on national and international trends, increasingly extreme and unpredictable climate conditions, and shifting priorities in Federal support. The farm safety net is crucial to farmers facing uncertainty, but its reach is also limited, as we well know. In 2022, only 19 percent of farms in the United States had crop insurance. In Connecticut, just five percent of those farms had crop insurance. Dr. Rainey, I appreciate the attention paid to crop insurance in your testimony, specifically the lack of options available to small farms and minority, underserved, and specialty crop producers. In your work what have you identified as the main barriers to access to crop insurance for small farms? Dr. Rainey. I appreciate that question. So I am currently under a Risk Management Agency Pilot Project across the South where we are actually trying to address that question and are collecting data actively right now, trying to, one, understand just the basic awareness of Federal crop insurance. One of the things that we found out through that that program where we have a cohort of program specialists talking to farmers and ranchers--and I will preface it by saying we are focusing on socially disadvantaged, marginalized farmers, small farmers--is asking them are they familiar with what the Federal crop insurance products are. Many of them are not. The reason I mentioned that in my testimony about NAP is because NAP is more disaster than it is crop insurance. And so from a fundamental risk management perspective, many of our small and minority farmers don't even understand the value of how they can transfer and manage risk using Federal crop insurance. In terms of identifying issues, we have just found that there is a lack of engagement in many places. Some of it I think is the incentives of the structure. You can make a lot more commissions if you are focusing on large-scale commodity farmers. And from what I understand--I am not a crop insurance expert--but the work and administrative workload of managing those or carrying out those policies for micro farm and whole farm is a little bit higher, so many agents will shy away from that, or maybe their book of business is fine that they say I am good for the year without trying to do that added program chasing clients. But the bottom line is many of our farmers and ranchers are outside of that safety net if you are looking at crop insurance as a potential net catcher if you will. Mrs. Hayes. Thank you. The USDA has consistently found that smaller farms are at higher financial risk. However, on this Committee, and most of our work historically has ignored the needs of those really small farms that we are talking about, farms like mine in New England. Over the past 2 years, New England farmers have experienced extreme weather events from droughts to late-season frost to torrential rains. Last month, I introduced a piece of legislation called Save Our Small Farms Act of 2024 (H.R. 8611) with the rest of the Connecticut delegation, which would improve access to and payouts from NAP, assist and incentivize farmers to purchase a Whole Farm Revenue Protection policy, and direct the USDA to study the feasibility of an index-based insurance policy for extreme weather events. Would you agree that expanding access to NAP and crop insurance coverage would help small farmers stay in business? Dr. Rainey. Absolutely. And what we have discovered is that there is a knowledge gap there. Many of those farmers don't understand Federal crop insurance, and many of them think that it is only for the large-scale farmers. There have been some new products, but that information has not made it for those businesses to consider. So yes, I think it can help. Mrs. Hayes. Thank you. My time has expired. And a focus on technical assistance is another top priority for me and my work on this Committee. I am sorry for going over, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Mr. Finstad. All right. We will go to Chairman Lucas from Oklahoma. Mr. Lucas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. When I had the privilege, honor, and responsibility of being Chairman of the Agriculture Committee in 2014, this Committee created the ARC and PLC programs and set the reference prices that producers are operating under today. Input costs have risen significantly since 2014, and reference prices are not accurately reflecting the cost of production today. Additionally, farm income is forecast to fall for the second consecutive year, and optimism in my part of the country is declining. So let me be clear, the time to make updates to the farm safety net is now. And I want to thank Chairman Thompson for producing a strong farm bill that includes significant upgrades to reference prices across commodities. Now, I want to begin my questions today by examining the effects of rising input costs on producers. Mr. Dunlow, you mentioned in your written testimony that the cost of production for cotton has increased by 24 percent since 2018, and growers are struggling to make ends meet. Can you please walk us through the different factors that have made growing cotton more expensive since 2018? And additionally, will you touch on the real-world impacts of what will happen to producers if Congress does not pass a farm bill this year? Mr. Dunlow. Yes, thank you. And like I said, on our farm, practically every input has gone up. It is labor, it is fuels, equipment, land rent, all inputs. And, historically, in my 40 year career, those do not come down. Labor, equipment price, certainly farm rent, those figures don't come down. Occasionally, fertilizers will come down a little bit, but they have gone up as much as 200 percent back during COVID, and it has come back down a little bit, but still significantly higher than it was in 2018. So these are the problems we are facing with commodity prices still staying at the same level and not kicking in the reference price, safety net part. Mr. Lucas. We have touched on the importance of a strong farm safety net that includes programs like ARC, PLC, and crop insurance. This question is for the panel. Can you discuss how crop insurance complements programs like ARC and PLC? Why is it important that the producers have access to both price protection and weather protection? And whoever would care to step up and take a swing. Dr. Allen-Tully. Thank you for the question. I can't work my microphone, but thank you for the question. Mr. Lucas. We are going to get you there. Pull it a little closer, please, if you can. Dr. Allen-Tully. I think that the ARC and PLC programs really provides a great safety net, but I would put it more as a put option. That would be the lowest point which we would be subject to. But I wouldn't farm without insurance any more than I would have a house without having homeowners insurance. If a hailstorm comes through, I want my homeowners insurance to be there to protect me, just like I want my crop insurance to be there to protect me if the same thing happens. And so it provides the flexibility for producers to engage in an insurance program that fits their needs and fits their level of risk. Mr. Lucas. Anyone else care to touch on that? I think that a good point has been made. It doesn't matter if you have price protection if you have nothing to sell, which is what crop insurance is about. By the same token, if you have a bountiful crop and there is no price, you are in the same box. All of you have experienced significant market volatility in recent years, so as we move towards the end of this year, what economic headwinds are you bracing for, and how will a farm bill help mitigate those challenges? And let's start with you, Dr. Allen-Tully. You got the last good one. You get to finish out with me. Dr. Allen-Tully. So I think that, for us, as we look forward into the end of the year, we are not sure how our crop is going to be. We have had some record rainfalls in Minnesota, and we also have headwind pressure on prices. So we are critically evaluating whatever capital purchases or investments that we may be interested in making and holding off for another year before we do anything more significant. Mr. Lucas. So you have to have a complete safety net, and it has got to be updated if you are going to survive. Dr. Allen-Tully. We need to have a complete--absolutely. Mr. Lucas. With that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Finstad. All right. We will go to the weatherman from Illinois, Mr. Sorensen. Mr. Sorensen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Dr. Allen-Tully, for mentioning that. Minnesota has seen so much rain, and we have seen the water levels rise in the Mississippi River Valley. Our farmers are dealing with that right now. But also the issue that we are seeing now is our focus as the waters recede in these farm fields, now we are looking toward increasing likelihood of heat. So effective measures against extreme weather events like this are vital to ensure that our producers can navigate the fluctuations that we are seeing in our weather. Financial tools like reference prices and crop insurance are integral to helping farmers keep food on the table and grow the energy that we need for uncertainty in economic times. These safeguards must remain robust and crafted in a way that benefits all producers fairly. The farm bill right now is a critical risk management tool for the heartland, and that is why it is imperative to ensure that the final text has broad bipartisan support and is financially sound. I will work toward that end because it not only helps our family farmers endure the hard times today, but it keeps them sustainable for generations to come. And so I want to turn to Dr. Rainey first. As the only meteorologist in this Committee or in Congress, we see these extreme weather events happening more frequently. When we look at this, the rate and frequency of these events makes the past no longer the prologue when determining the future risks to producers. These impacts affect productivity globally, contributing to an already volatile commodity market. What enhancements to existing risk management tools in the farm bill do you believe will prepare farming communities to survive future challenges? Dr. Rainey. I think that crop insurance is definitely--as my fellow panel members have stated, crop insurance is an important part of that. To understand those that aren't currently being served by Federal crop insurance, I think it is important to look for ways to try to expand that, whether that is through broader technical assistance to help farmers and ranchers understand that risk mitigating factor because if they don't have crop insurance, and if they are outside of the safety net, then they are financing their risk on their balance sheets. And that is a place that we really need more and more businesses to truly understand that. And so I think crop insurance and adjustments to expanding that, looking at possibly subsidy levels, looking at ways of possible technical assistance to enhance understanding and use of it either from RMA or through education through the land- grant systems, I think those are some avenues that would pay dividends because I think the more that we can move from ad hoc disaster assistance, the better off the farmers are, the better off the system is because what we have always talked about is the risk. And what the farm bill does is take some of that uncertainty of the risk out, and it gives programs and avenues for farmers to strategically engage. I work a lot with extension risk management where we talk about the full range of risk management tools, and there are some things that I think we do in technical assistance there. But the profit squeeze that we have right now where input prices are above commodity prices, that is going to require some intervention. And that is just the bottom line with this current squeeze. Unless we can reverse that, it is difficult. Mr. Sorensen. Thank you. I appreciate that. I did want to talk briefly. The Inflation Reduction Act (Pub. L. 117-169) provides tax credits to promote the production of clean energy. And in my district in the surrounding areas in northern Illinois, sustainable aviation fuel is needed now more than ever. However, how can we let it happen? Brazilian ethanol and used cooking oil from China is coming into our country and it is allowed to use these tax credits when our family farmers and our producers have the ability to bring this to fruition. I know my time is waning, but, Dr. Allen-Tully, I want to turn this to you. How critical is it for the Treasury to craft energy tax credits that prioritize our American farmers and our domestic producers? Dr. Allen-Tully. The sustainable aviation fuel space is one of the most exciting things that we have coming as a corn farmer. And right now, how the Treasury has their guidance written, it would exclude us. And so it is almost insulting to believe that we would bring in sugarcane ethanol into the U.S. in place of homegrown ethanol grown here. Mr. Sorensen. I appreciate that. I know my time is expiring, but the decisions that we made with respect to ethanol in the 1990s really helped our family farmers, and I think sustainable aviation fuel is needed today. Mr. Alford.  The gentleman's time has expired. Mr. Sorensen. Thank you. Mr. Alford. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Indiana, Mr. Baird. Mr. Baird. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate having this session on financial conditions in farm country. And any of us that are involved in agriculture, you certainly recognize how important the prices are, how important costs are associated with trying to produce a crop. So I think it is very appropriate to have the kind of expertise we have here today, and I really want to thank you for being here. I guess the first thing I am going to start off is with Mr. Hotchkiss. You are from Evansville, Indiana, and you probably know some of the folks at the Indiana Bankers Association like Amber Van Til and Rex Betzner. Anyway, good to have you here. Mr. Hotchkiss. Thank you. Mr. Baird. I was really proud of them when we were going through the PPP and how much contact they had with the local community and their involvement. It is part of the fabric of our rural community, so thank you for that. Mr. Hotchkiss. Absolutely. Mr. Baird. But what I wanted to start out with, in your testimony, you mentioned the Farm, Food, and National Security Act and those provisions that help meet the financial needs of producers across the country. Can you expand further on how important these changes will be to you and to other bankers and keeping producers cash-flow during these times? Mr. Hotchkiss. Well, thank you for the question. The importance is being able to have the Act continue, one of the items was increasing the guarantee limits. And what that does, costs have come up. Entry to the industry is high, as I said earlier, and separating the operating limit from the land limit or the real estate limit is really important because what it allows the farmers to do is to continue to expand their operation, but it also allows whoever is financing them to leverage those programs and those guarantee programs at a level that makes more sense, that fits the current environment that we are all working within so that they can expand and grow. In terms of other farm bill issues, working on the definition and changing who is a beginning farmer was critical because, before, there were people that were beginning farmers but didn't meet the definition because of the way it was written. And so, having that done and the downpayment assistance programs is going to help, especially the beginning and young farmers. Those are just three that come to mind, and it is really critical that we have those things in place so that we can meet the needs of not only beginning farmers, but all farmers. Mr. Baird. Well, thank you very much. Mr. Caldwell, can you elaborate from a retailer's perspective the relevance of the farm safety net for affiliated businesses? And how much of an impact do you think crop insurance will have on your customers? Mr. Caldwell. So as it has been mentioned by the other panelists, the crop insurance program, I mean, it is the best safety net tool that we have out there. Our businesses, I mean, we are directly connected to the producers. We are in the same communities. Our employee base, a lot of them still fortunately come from the farm. They are embedded in those communities. And in a lot of cases, agriculture is the primary employer in many of these rural communities, so without that safety net--and we talk about the safety net for producers. This safety net is for those communities because without them, without their success, then none of the rest of us succeed. So as you live and you work in these rural communities, you see the so agriculture goes, so our farmers go, so our communities go. Mr. Baird. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I would like to just make a comment. I had another question, but I have enough time to make this comment I think. Mr. Alford. Without objection. Mr. Baird. The Draft Herbicide Strategy proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency would force growers to adopt costly burdensome mitigation measures just to use important tools like glyphosate, Dicamba, and atrazine. And so I am just going to make sure I get this on the record that we are concerned about some of the things and the overreach that EPA has and their use of the Endangered Species Act and all that. So I wanted to make sure we got that in the comments today. But I thank all of you for being here. Mr. Alford. Does the gentleman yield? Thank you. We now recognize Mr. Soto from Florida. Mr. Soto. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, so much. Proud to represent the central Florida area. It is kind of SEC country, so I guess it is pretty close with Gainesville and Tallahassee, although we root for the Knights. And in our area, we have blueberries, strawberries, obviously citrus, cattle, huge commodities. We are proud to have many generations of farmers in central Florida. And we know that through the farm bill very important to increase the commodity reference prices that has been discussed a couple of times today. We want to make sure that every farmer, including young farmers, have a future and that we have a future food supply. We also know through the IRA, investments in resilience and getting access to water has been something I have seen firsthand in central Florida that has been really helpful. Mr. Caldwell, you had mentioned the changing climate and what we are facing in the Southeast with getting hit by hurricanes every year almost. How important would it be to make sure we codify disaster block grant authority right now? If we don't put it in every disaster relief bill, then they are not authorized necessarily. And then we saw in Florida and a couple other states that it was very difficult to get the money out there. So how important is it that we streamline disaster relief for farmers after hurricanes who may not have commodities covered by crop insurance, which is obviously also a good tool? Mr. Caldwell. So, obviously, we would rather have that frontline, something you could depend on, so anything that we can do to streamline that inefficiency. And when it happens and the relief is there, it is great. I don't know how many bankers want to finance on that. That is a challenge, so any consistency we can get with any of those relief tools. Now, I started in this business in 1980. The weather was, I don't know how many in the room remember it, but it was not good. It was not good. And so from there, I am a weather watcher. It so ingrained if you are in agriculture. It is something that you do. And yes, those hurricanes, the threat of hurricanes, those are the things that keep you up at night. And we have already started this year in Texas. We already had some crops that have been damaged. Hopefully, the safety net is there. But anything we can do to improve the consistency of that and the transparency and the reliability is a good day. Mr. Soto. One of the main things in the Inflation Reduction Act for agriculture was to help with more resilience. What are some of the different resiliency types of actions that local farmers in the Southeast are taking to try to strengthen them against the weather we are seeing? Mr. Caldwell. So, I mean, we can have diversity in crops. I mean, we can have all kinds of diversity there, but that doesn't really protect us against the weather so to speak. I mean, growers, obviously, they do things that they can, try to get a crop in early. If you can get a crop in early, you can harvest early. But there is not a whole lot they can do to protect themselves against a hurricane. Mr. Soto. And then, Mr. Hotchkiss, I know we have heard Secretary Vilsack talk a lot about trying to protect small farmers and trends in consolidation. Larger-scale efficiency has been kind of a push in the industry that has kind of pushed away from small farmers. From a lender perspective, how do we keep it balanced to encourage more farmers to stay in the business and be able to continue to grow? Mr. Hotchkiss. Thank you for the question. I think to keep more farmers engaged and in the business and to encourage others to enter the industry, whether they are young farmers or not, we have to have safety nets in place, and we have to have programs in place that help protect them not only from price, but also on the cost side. Our reference prices have to be relevant every year so that there is a really high correlation to the actual costs. And then there have to be programs, whether through the USDA or direct, that help provide that safety net because there are so many uncontrollable risks in this business. And, as people think about entering the business and becoming a farmer, they are weighing all of those, and if those safety nets aren't out there, they may and really have been choosing not to enter it. Mr. Soto. Thank you, Mr. Hotchkiss. We are seeing in central Florida citrus has had a real challenge because of greening as an example from changing weather and from pests that we have. And while it is improving, there are a lot of challenges we face in the Southeast. I appreciate your perspective, and I yield back. Mr. Alford. The chair now recognizes the Member from Iowa, Mr. Feenstra. Mr. Feenstra. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Ranking Member Scott. Thank you for our witnesses. I represent the second largest ag district in the country, predominantly corn, soybeans, cattle, hogs, dairy, eggs, turkeys, you name it, we have it all. And I am very passionate about making sure that we continue to be the breadbasket to the world. The problem is we have a beginning farmer and the next generation of trying to take over, but it is problematic. I mean, you think about, right now, nine percent of our farmers are under the age of 35 where over 40 percent of them are over the age of 65. So how can we make sure that that land and that farm gets passed onto the next generation? We are already seeing corporate companies and foreign lands buying our land and no longer the American farmer. He doesn't have it. So I want to first talk about crop insurance. Dr. Allen- Tully, I want to talk to you. When you think about crop insurance, that beginning farmer, it is a very significant expense. I mean, it is probably the number one expense besides seed when you have to buy crop insurance. I created a bill that is in the farm bill to try to lower that cost. Can you talk a little bit about that, of how important it is to make sure that beginning farmer has incentives so they can operate in an effective manner and to be profitable? Dr. Allen-Tully. Absolutely. Thank you, Congressman Feenstra, for your work on this legislation, along with Congresswoman Craig. It would seem that the both of you truly have an interest in making sure that we have future farmers that are able to make it into the business. We also very much appreciate that Chairman Thompson included it in the bill. A little while ago, I was a beginning farmer. But having tools that are specific to them, the capital requirements to get into farming these days are too significant for someone who is 25 or 30 to be able to go to their banker and take on that debt and without a strong safety net and without them being able to show that they would at least have a floor under their crop if something happened out of their control is critical. Mr. Feenstra. That is right. It is absolutely critical. And you teed it up for me. When you think of how it all works together for that the beginning farmer and also you need the banker, you need that operational loan, and you got to work with that bank, with that loan officer saying, ``All right, not only do I got to pay my land rent or pay land price, I also have to pay for that input.'' I worked on the ACRE Act of 2023 (H.R. 3139, Access to Credit for our Rural Economy Act of 2023) or actually I am the writer, the author of the ACRE Act. Mr. Hotchkiss, can you talk a little bit about operational loans and what it does if we can lower the interest rate just a little bit for not only the beginning farmer, but also operational loans on farmers? Mr. Hotchkiss. Yes, I can. First of all, thank you for the question, and thank you for your work on the ACRE Act because, as you know, the ABA has been very supportive of that. The ACRE Act reduces the interest--first of all, it levels the playing field with all financial competitors within the agricultural industry so that we are all playing by the same rules, all playing on the same field. But I believe that will make things more competitive. It will force all providers of credit to compete in the same field, and therefore, that will lower the cost. And interest cost is a huge item for whether it is a beginning farmer or an existing farmer. And by doing that, you are going to help stabilize, make more credit available, and allow them to finance or maybe, if it is a young and beginning farmer, actually get into the farming sector. Mr. Feenstra. Absolutely. Mr. Hotchkiss. And so we really appreciate you and all you have done for the ACRE Act and hope that it moves forward. Mr. Feenstra. Thanks. One other topic I want to talk about, especially in Iowa, we have 60 farmer-owned cooperatives, and I know, Mr. Caldwell, you are very involved in that. I sit on Ways and Means also. 199A has to be extended, 20 percent pass- through for co-ops, cooperatives. What does this mean, and why is it so important? Can you just address this very, very briefly? I got 30 seconds Mr. Caldwell. I can. I have spent my whole career in the cooperative system, the reverse ownership model. And, 199A actually, it just gives the cooperative system a level playing field. And I can just tell you, if we remove that, that will be a direct cost to the member-owners. Mr. Feenstra. It would be catastrophic, a massive problem, absolutely. Mr. Caldwell. Absolutely. Mr. Feenstra. I am very passionate about it. I have created a bill to make it permanent, but I will do it through reconciliation next year. Thank you very much, and I yield back. Mr. Alford. Thank you. The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Ohio, Ms. Brown. Ms. Brown. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to our panelists as well. Your comments have been very insightful. As this Committee continues our work on this year's farm bill, we must remain committed to ensuring our hardworking farmers have the resources and strong safety net they need to thrive. In my home State of Ohio, agriculture was responsible for contributing over $15 million to the 2022 economy. The strength and resilience of our agriculture supply chain and economy have a direct influence on our national security, economic success, and Americans' access to nutritious foods. And I want to emphasize the significance of ensuring that this farm bill works for everyone, and importantly, that it brings more farmers into the fold. A farm economy where the rich and big keep getting richer and bigger is not sustainable or successful. Our great existing programs like crop insurance must intentionally include new, young, and socially disadvantaged farmers, as well as those working in nontraditional spaces like urban agriculture. Our strength is rooted in our diversity, and now is the time to invest in that. So, Dr. Rainey, you shared that you served as part of the USDA's Equity Commission. What recommendations did the Commission share that would impact minority and socially disadvantaged farmers? And did you see those changes reflected in the House farm bill? Dr. Rainey. We saw a number of the recommendations addressed in terms of trying to expand the safety net, in terms of the reference to trying to update base acres, trying to get more people to be able to benefit from that safety net process. One of the things we were trying to do is we were trying to very broadly serve all of agriculture as we lifted up the systems and the programs. And what we were focused on was trying to give recommendations that there was more intentionality, to make sure that the historically underserved had a seat at the table, that they could get access in terms of how the programs were administered and in some ways how those programs were written out. We also asked to see the data on the participation so that we could actually see where there was progress being made in terms of application rates and acceptance rates to try to see if we could get to that data, to actually show the data of how the farmers that were coming into the USDA offices were being served. It is an ongoing process. I think many of the recommendations are still being worked on. We get briefings. And I can't give you the line item by line item. I think that progress is being made, but I think there is work that still needs to be done, and I think this Committee can step in to support some of those efforts. Ms. Brown. Thank you. And, Dr. Rainey, can you share what the impacts of bolstering programs focusing on new and socially disadvantaged farmers would be on our farm economy? Dr. Rainey. Absolutely. I think that agriculture is a very important sector to our country. We talked about the national security issues. But in many parts of our country, agriculture drives those rural economies. And when those farmers suffer, those economies suffer. And we see that in many high-poverty areas across the country that have been longstanding because agriculture is not equitably thrived. I think that some of the programs that help our farmers, our beginning farmers, we talked about the cost of entry, so anything that we can do to help with financing, special programs to help those farmers get some kind of a helping hand as they start to move up, as they build into a high cost-of- entry sector, with the recognition that there are different models out there because sometimes there is a struggle with those farmers getting financing because they are not the traditional row crop farmer or rancher. They are coming onto a different innovative model, and sometimes there is a lack of understanding or appreciation of how that cash-flows, even understanding how to get those financials on it. So some expanded efforts in that space I think will be beneficial because one of the things we talk about it, and you talk about profitability, so the youngsters, even family members of many farmers, the farmers that I work with it, many of them are leaving agriculture. So if we want that next generation to stay engaged, I think we have to give them some profitable options because oftentimes, they are handling a lot of money, but they are not being profitable. Ms. Brown. Thank you. And as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities, Risk Management, and Credit, I have heard firsthand about how strong up-front investments in farm safety net and risk management programs provide peace of mind and certainty for our farmers and ranchers. So I only have a few seconds, but to any member of our panel, what are the key benefits of crop insurance for the farm economy, and how does it help mitigate risk to ensure financial stability for farmers? If I might get a response from one. Mr. Alford. The gentlewoman's time has expired. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Kansas, Mr. Mann. Mr. Mann. I thank the gentleman from Missouri and appreciate Chairman Thompson hosting today's hearing. Thank you all for being here as we underscore the need for a comprehensive 5 year farm bill. The title of this whole hearing, let's just not forget the financial conditions in farm country. I can tell you as the Congressman from the Big First District in Kansas where we raise a lot of wheat, a lot of sorghum, a lot of corn, a lot of beans, getting to be a lot of cotton, the two words I would use to describe the financial condition of the farm economy is concerning and worsening. And I think we all see that. I think that is coming out here today. About a year ago, Chairman Thompson and I hosted a farm bill listening session in the middle of a wheat field right in the middle of Kansas in my district. We heard from 150 Kansans about their priorities for a farm bill. They were crystal clear that day. We need a farm bill that gives them certainty as they work day in and day out to feed, fuel, and clothe us all. We need a farm bill that addresses record high inflation, risky market volatility, and extreme conditions that we are seeing on farms and ranches in Kansas and in every corner of the country. We need a farm bill that prioritizes farm country and gets input prices back under control, and we need a farm bill that is long enough to provide certainty, yet short enough to adjust and adapt and change with the time with market conditions, and we need it now. I have often said that my top priority in this farm bill is to protect and strengthen crop insurance. And there will be those that want to chip away, diminish, weaken, and I think we need to be fortifying it, strengthening it, making it better. In my view, crop insurance is the most successful public- private partnership in the history of the country and is the most cost-effective way to deliver a safe, robust, steady, constant food supply, incredibly important. A question for you to start with, Mr. Hotchkiss, and thank you for being here. Your voice is really important in these conversations. Please highlight the challenges that you as a lender face when working with producers on ad hoc disaster assistance versus working with producers on more certain programs like crop insurance? Mr. Hotchkiss. Thank you for the question. The challenge when it is an ad hoc program like, say, a hurricane or a derecho, the big buzzword now in weather, historically, there have been bills passed to provide disaster assistance, but the amount of time it takes to get the money to the end-user, to the farmer has just been too long. Mr. Mann. Yes. Mr. Hotchkiss. There are examples that I could share where it has taken up to 2 years in certain parts of the country for that money to get to the producer. And it not only puts them in an extremely tough position, but then they come to their bankers, and the bankers are then put in a position to hopefully have assets to leverage, but they are loaning against that revenue source that they aren't really sure how much is coming in. There is a bit of confidence that, okay, I know the legislation passed, and there is a bill for so much money to come into to help pay for this disaster, but you don't really know how much is coming to that specific borrower or farmer. And so from my perspective, when you have an ad hoc disaster program, there needs to be timelines set within the legislation that, after funding, once it gets to the FSA office, they have so long to start taking an application, so long to process an application, and then so long to write a check. And that time frame needs to be condensed, maybe 4 to 6 months at the outside. Mr. Mann. I completely agree. And also as a lender, you don't know how much is coming in when it is coming in. Mr. Hotchkiss. Yes, you don't know, exactly. Mr. Mann. Other than that, you know everything you need to know, right? I mean, the most important things you don't know, but what do you do? Mr. Hotchkiss. Versus the other programs--I will put them all together--if it is crop insurance, what that program is and how it is going to pay if this happens. Mr. Mann. Certainly. Mr. Hotchkiss. And so that certainty gives a bank comfort. Mr. Mann. Yes, certainty, predictability, incredibly important with all businesses, including our ag producers, who I would argue are some of the most sophisticated businesspeople in the entire country, given the risk that they take on and what they do. One more quick question for you, Mr. Caldwell. As a business that relies so heavily on farmers and ranchers, you also have to take steps to manage the risk. As margins become tighter for them, of course that impacts your business. What are the steps that you take as you are trying to manage risk along with your producers? Mr. Caldwell. So, the one that certainly comes to mind at first--and you don't think about maybe that sector being in the finance business, but about \1/3\ of our business is probably extended terms. And so with that, with the high interest rates, one thing that happens to us first, we get round 1 on the cost to carry. Round 2, we are trying to figure out how do we cover that increased cost? Because we really can't continue to---- Mr. Alford. The gentleman's time has expired. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Bishop. Mr. Bishop. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. According to the February 2024 farm income forecast, government payments such as the conservation payments near a margin curve, which are the farm bill commodity payments and the supplemental disaster relief are forecast to fall $10.2 billion in 2024, which is a decrease of 15.9 percent from 2023. The decline is expected largely because of lower supplemental and ad hoc disaster assistance in 2024 relative to 2023. Of course, government payments always bring up a heated discussion here in Congress within the conversations regarding the farm bill, and so I really want to avoid the controversy, but I do have a few questions. Do you believe--and this is directed specifically to the growers--that it is possible in the current state of our farm economy to turn a profit without some form of Federal help? Mr. Dunlow. Thank you. And I would say absolutely not. We run budgets each year on each different crops, and, as I mentioned before, none of the crops show a profit on budgets. Dr. Allen-Tully. I would agree with David Dunlow. Mr. Bishop. Okay. Government subsidies, again, always controversial, but in both of your written testimonies, you potentially suggested farmers are going to need some kind of economic assistance, given the current climate, even if they did not suffer from a natural disaster. This would serve as either a bridge until a successful farm bill is implemented or in case of farm bill is not enacted. I asked Secretary Vilsack about the potential for a one- time payment back in February when he testified before the Agriculture Subcommittee of Appropriations. Can you confirm whether or not you would suggest that type of assistance? And if so, how should that assistance be designed or allocated, and which commodities should be eligible? And what should the standard be for farmers to qualify? Mr. Dunlow. Absolutely. If a farm bill was passed today, it would go into law in 2025, and after the price discovery, if you earned a payment, you would be receiving it in the fall of 2026. So you referred to it. That is a long time to get some help. And as desperate as it is now on the farm, we need help now. We are on the verge of a tremendous crisis, in my opinion. Dr. Allen-Tully. And I would say up in Minnesota we have had record rains this year, which is a stark difference from last year when we had severe drought, and so I think right now, we are all keeping our eye on how the next 4 weeks go. But certainly with the price reduction on, if corn is around $4 a bushel, maybe just from a price perspective, not in addition to a yield. Mr. Bishop. Can you perhaps give us some suggestions of how we can convince our colleagues to provide funding for that assistance, given the fact that they seem unwilling to fully fund USDA in the annual appropriations bill or to provide additional funding to the Agriculture Committee or even bless the Chairman's ideas for funding for increased reference prices? Can you give us some hints as to how we can possibly make some additional arguments to try to carry that? Mr. Dunlow. I guess my comment would be we desperately need ad hoc in any form, shape, or fashion that we can get it. It is that desperate on the turnrow now. That is the situation we are in. And I truly think at the beginning of next year, if nothing is done, we will be facing a crisis. Dr. Allen-Tully. I think that the farm bill focuses on farm and nutrition title, but in reality, the farm bill is really a rural community bill, and so there are a lot of titles in the farm bill that will help support our communities and our auxiliary. Mr. Bishop. Mr. Hotchkiss? Mr. Hotchkiss. Yes, just real briefly, there has been shared concern about not only the age of the farmers, but how do we make it easier for young and beginning farmers to enter this industry. If you are looking for an argument with your colleagues, if farmers keep losing money, it is going to make it real hard to talk people into coming into this industry. Mr. Alford. The gentleman's time has expired. The chair now recognizes the gentlewoman from Illinois, Ms. Miller. Mrs. Miller of Illinois. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for being here today. I deeply appreciate your insights on the farm economy, and I share your concerns about rising input costs. Dr. Allen-Tully, I was old enough to remember the farm crisis of 1980, and I am greatly concerned about the situation we are in today. You mentioned in your testimony that we have a record ag trade deficit of $32 billion a year. I hear from constituents about their frustration and even fear about this Administration's inability to negotiate new trade agreements. How vital to the agriculture industry is it to have a President who can negotiate trade agreements that benefit U.S. farmers? Dr. Allen-Tully. In the farm bill that was passed out of the House, we greatly appreciate the doubling of the MAP and FMD programs. Trade is critical to any corn grower that we have. We are the best in the world at growing our commodity, and we want to be able to share that commodity with the rest of the world for food security and safety. Mrs. Miller of Illinois. Do you get the impression that our trade policy has been lax or that they have been passive about pursuing new trade agreements? Dr. Allen-Tully. It would seem that it is not a priority. Mrs. Miller of Illinois. Mr. Caldwell, in your testimony, you mentioned the negative impacts Biden's climate policies have had on input costs for farmers. Could you please explain how these policies impact your customers and if they have had to change the way they farm because of it? Mr. Caldwell. Of course, energy is a big part of the input cost from two perspectives. One, we just look at the fuel that gets used not only in their equipment, but also in their power plants to irrigate, and so that is certainly a huge impact. And then the other is the impact on the fertilizer production business. Natural gas is certainly a huge component that contributes to that cost. And those are two of the biggest input costs that most producers would have. Mrs. Miller of Illinois. Yes, and it has become painful. Under the Biden Administration, we have seen record inflation, rising input costs, and a decrease of American energy production. My fellow farmers are concerned that the Biden supply chain crisis, inflation crisis, and energy crisis threaten the very existence of the family farm. Farm income is decreasing, while consumer prices hit record highs. China is taking advantage of us, and we must unleash American energy, including biofuels, to fight back. With all the uncertainty farmers currently face, they need the certainty of a 5 year farm bill. I appreciate our witnesses coming today to advocate on behalf of production agriculture. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back. Mr. Alford. The gentlewoman yields back. The gentlewoman from Texas, Ms. Crockett, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. Crockett. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. And before I begin my official remarks, I am just curious to know, are any of the witnesses of the opinion that inflation is something that only hit the United States, or is it something that was global? Does anyone know the answer to this strict question? Anybody? Inflation global or limited to United States? No one knows. Interesting. I will give you the answer. It was global because the pandemic was global. So this is going to be an interesting time. Let me get to my official remarks. I hope we can get some answers on some of these questions. We all agree that a 5 year farm bill authorization has a significant impact on the farm economy we are here to talk about today. Unfortunately, in pursuing pointless partisan political pandering policies for the Heritage Foundation types like cruelly cutting SNAP, my Republican colleagues have forestalled any kind of bipartisan deal needed to actually pass a bill in a divided government. Now, we all know that jumping from extension to extension is hurting our farmers and ranchers who aren't able to pay or plan for the future when they don't know what the policy will be. That is why I thought we were all on the same page, that we needed to get a bipartisan farm bill reauthorized as soon as possible. Yet over the last few weeks, more and more of my Republican colleagues are suggesting that it wouldn't be so bad if we waited until 2025 to pass a farm bill. Well, I want to nip that talk right in the bud and make sure everyone understands just how devastating that could be for the farm economy and in fact the entire economy. You see, my Republican colleagues who think a 2025 Farm Bill would be worth waiting for think that way because they think a potential Trump Administration would be good for the bill. Have any of you ever heard of Project 2025? This isn't a trick question either. And no one has responded. So let me help you. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to enter the Heritage Foundation's, Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise, Project 2025, Chapter 10, Department of Agriculture, pages 289 through 318, into the record. Mr. Alford. Without objection.  Ms. Crockett. Thank you so much. This action plan, written by Trump's closest advisors, has a whole lot to say about the farm bill that I don't think my colleagues on this Committee will like. It calls for the elimination of the sugar program, which would destroy what is left of our domestic sugar industry at a time when they are already struggling. These Trump advisors also called to eliminate the vital Conservation Reserve Program, pulling the rug out from farmers and ranchers all across the country. And that is just the tip of the iceberg. I encourage everyone watching this to read what I just entered into the record. Let me try to sum it up in just a couple of words. My question for each member of the panel, in a word, what would be the impact if the next farm bill completely eliminated ARC and PLC payments if there is anyone that can answer? No one? Okay. So no one knows. Well, I will tell you, the unthinkable would happen. Trump's advisors and Project 2025 also call for the elimination of these vital programs. What we on the Agriculture Committee know to be a vital support to ensure our farmers and ranchers don't lose their land because of the cyclical nature of production of agriculture, Trump's advisors view as, and I quote, ``especially egregious examples of what they think needs to be cut.'' Frankly, if you want to put more farm in the farm bill, we need to get a farm bill reauthorized and out the gate before these anti-farmer advisors have a chance to be in the White House depending on how the November election goes. And for those who think that a potential Trump Administration wouldn't actually take steps to achieve these policies, let me remind you of something many Americans have forgotten. In the waning days of the Trump Administration, December 2020, the President of the United States vetoed the National Defense Authorization Act (Pub. L. 116-283, William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021) 2 days before Christmas. Funding for our troops was jeopardized because advisors wanted to show their support for Confederate traitors. In an emboldened potential next Trump Administration, it is sadly far too easy to imagine a veto of the farm bill that doesn't have these terrible provisions. So to my Republican colleagues gambling on a potential Trump Administration, I am asking you to put our farmers and ranchers first, drop this nonsensical, nonstarter SNAP cut, come back to the negotiating table, and work with Democrats to get the farm bill passed this year. Failing to do so by far is the biggest threat to our farm economy. With that, I yield back. Mr. Alford. Thank you. The gentlewoman yields. The chair now recognizes himself for 5 minutes. Like most of my colleagues here, I recognize that agriculture is the backbone of many of our states' economies and communities. Missouri ag specifically generates more than $93 billion annually, employing nearly 460,000 persons. We are home to 87,000 farms, the second largest number in the U.S. Yet producers in Missouri and across America are facing rising inflation, growing input prices, decreasing commodity prices, leading to declining farm income. This is why we passed a bipartisan farm bill that supports the farmers who feed, fuel, and clothe the world. In fact, Ms. Crockett and I worked on a very important amendment to the farm bill that ensures that not only fresh fruits and vegetables are included in our SNAP programs, but also frozen fruits and vegetables and canned fruits and vegetables as well, proving that this is a bipartisan effort. My first question is for Mr. Hotchkiss. In your testimony, you point to the importance of a robust farm safety net and highlight the House farm bill's enhancements that help producers remain financially viable. In what ways would this Committee's passed farm bill help those producers plant another crop this spring? Mr. Hotchkiss. Well, thank you for the question. First and foremost, the increased guarantee limits will ensure in some cases that farmers have the ability in challenged times to obtain a guaranteed operating loan because the limits have been increased, so that is tremendously important. And, second, being able to have downpayment assistance when needed for different producers that is part of the farm bill is going to help them make sure that they can plant next year. Maintaining crop insurance as well as appropriate reference prices would be a third item that I would mention because, most banks are asking and requiring as part of a loan deal that a farmer get it, but it just brings assurance and helps manage the risk. Mr. Alford. Mr. Dunlow, thank you for being here. I very much appreciate you sharing your challenges that you and your family have faced. Folks who may not be familiar with ag often underestimate the amount of capital that is put at risk. Can you please paint a picture of how much capital you put at risk year after year and how the impact of even a small change in your profit margin can affect your ability to secure an operating loan? Mr. Dunlow. Yes, thank you. On my particular farm we have an operating loan of $2.2 million, along with, as the gentleman mentioned, we have a line of credit with our input company of $800,000. So we are investing $3 million annually, and that has to be paid back every year before you can go back and get another operating loan. And the margins are very, very thin on what we are working on typically under normal conditions. And with the economy now, nothing cash-flows, and it is very difficult to get those loans and to move on to the next year. Mr. Alford. Are you aware we are losing 1,000 farms a month in America? Mr. Dunlow. I wasn't aware of that figure, but I was aware we are certainly losing---- Mr. Alford. It is a staggering number when we consider that our food security is our national security. I know we say that a lot in here, but it is not a trite statement. When we are facing potential war against China, the threats from Russia, we have to maintain our food security. I had one more question here for Dr. Rainey. For the record, are any safety net programs currently provided by the USDA in any way contingent upon race, ethnicity, gender, political affiliation, or religion? Dr. Rainey. Not to my knowledge. Mr. Alford. Thank you. I appreciate that. The gentlelady from Texas mentioned something about Project 2025 from the Heritage Foundation. I would just like to submit for the record President Trump has not adopted the Heritage Foundation 2025 project. He is standing by the officially adopted 20 plank platform of the Republican National Committee. It does not mention sugar subsidies one bit. With that, I yield the balance of my time and recognize the gentlelady from Illinois, Ms. Budzinski. Ms. Budzinski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to the panelists for being here today. I appreciate what each of you have shared in your testimony about the challenges farmers are facing. And much of what has been said are things that I have heard from constituent farmers in my district in central and southern Illinois. Rising land costs and rent is something that is top of mind as we have these conversations. In my district, agricultural land has been valued at over $12,000 an acre, over three times the national average last year. Access to capital is one of the top challenges for young folks to get involved with farming, which is why I introduced the bipartisan Increasing Land Access, Security, and Opportunity Act (H.R. 3955) with Congressman Zach Nunn as a first step to addressing this important issue. Beyond that, many of you have highlighted the importance of the farm safety net. In my home State of Illinois, by and far the most important aspect of the farm safety net is crop insurance. My corn and soybean farmers do not reliably receive Title I payments, so I will continue to be an advocate of a strengthened Federal Crop Insurance Program. And one final thing I hear a lot about is the need for expanding market access, whether internationally or domestically. I was very glad to see that our Chairman included a doubling of MAP and FMD in his farm bill, for example. And I am also a major advocate of increasing access to domestic markets. I have two questions. The first is for Dr. Allen-Tully. One major market for growers in my district, both corn and soybean growers, is biofuel production. Can you share what your experience has been with market access for ethanol and what if anything can be improved? Dr. Allen-Tully. Well, there is a bill for unleaded 88 or ethanol E15 to be across the country, and we would strongly advocate for that bill to move forward. We believe that it is a homegrown option to have cleaner air right now and also to address some of the climate concerns that consumers have. Ms. Budzinski. Yes, I very much agree with you around E15 for sure. And I often in my district talk about it as a win- win-win, to your point, lowering carbon emissions but helping our growers. It is a win-win, so I share that opinion. Yes. Dr. Allen-Tully. Absolutely. Ms. Budzinski. Can I ask another question? Mr. Hotchkiss, one thing that many of my growers note is that the price of land and to rent land is the most cost-prohibitive part of farming. How do you think Congress can work constructively beyond the ACRE Act with lending organizations to improve outcomes and access for these growers? Mr. Hotchkiss. Thank you for the question. You are absolutely right. The cost of land and/or the cost of rent, whether it is cash rent or some type of equitable crop share rent is getting very, very high. And in addition to the ACRE Act, as you mentioned, which will reduce the interest cost to borrowers, I don't know that I have any solutions because land is an open market. Obviously, there are a lot of investors, some foreign investors, and I know that has been something discussed. Potentially limiting foreign investment, all this investment money has come in. And when you get bidders bidding against land, and there is land that is a lot more than $12,000, as you know, in different states. I think the record I have heard is  $30,000. So it just continues to get higher and higher, and it is because of the investment money that has is bidding the price up. Ms. Budzinski. We need to keep working on that issue. And I guess with that, I will yield back the balance of my time. Thanks. Mr. Alford. Thank you. The gentlewoman yields back. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota, Mr. Finstad. Mr. Finstad. Thank you. And I want to thank Chairman Thompson for holding this important hearing, and thank you for the witnesses for your testimony today. As we have heard today, farm country is facing significant challenges from the weather-related disasters that we have seen firsthand in southern Minnesota with the severe flooding that we have had to the compounding effects of increase input costs, interest rates, declining commodity prices, decreased net farm income, and trade deficits. To address these challenges, the House Agriculture Committee passed a very strong bipartisan farm bill in May, and I am very proud of the work that the Chairman and the Committee has done on that. With that said, my first question is for Dr. Allen-Tully. Dana, as you know, the farm safety net is the cornerstone of the farm bill, and it provides tools for farmers that we need to fuel and feed the world while ensuring that we can pass our farms down to the next generation. Specifically, the counter- cyclical safety net is intended to protect producers from multiple years of significant downturn, and crop insurance is farmers' number one risk management tool that we use everything from when we begin our conversations with lenders to our marketing decisions at the back end. So my question is if we don't pass a 5 year farm bill this year that improves the farm safety net, how do you see that affecting your operation and the operations of your neighbors in southern Minnesota? Dr. Allen-Tully. Well, given the year that we are faced with and the weather challenges that we have had, as well as the reduction in commodity prices, I think there is going to be quite a few hard conversations with lenders as we move into next winter and spring and access to rental contracts as we are renegotiating rental contracts with our landlords I think are going to be more difficult, and there may be some really hard decisions around the kitchen table as we move forward. Mr. Finstad. Yes, I totally agree. I mean, we are seeing 30 to 40 percent un-marketed corn and soybeans sitting in bins right now across this country. If I were to sell my corn right now, I would get about $4 a bushel. Beans are about, what is it, $11.19, $11.20? It all equals to being upside down pretty severely, and that becomes hard to sustain year over year, let alone have the conversation about how do we keep things going in farm country for the next generation to prosper. One of the things I want to talk about here is, again, very proud of Chairman Thompson's work and the Committee's work on the farm bill that we were able to pass out of Committee. I am a little bit alarmed at the narrative around the support of the framework that the Senate has. I just want to be crystal clear to anybody that is listening. We have a 900 page farm bill that we kind of put our money where our mouth is, and we showed the American public where this Committee stands in a bipartisan way. The Senate right now is a framework. That is essentially taking a napkin and jotting some ideas down and saying this is what we are going to do. And so for us, again, we have shown our plan. We have shown the bill to our country. And if we look at some of the very serious things that we have talked about in this hearing already and the severe economic challenges that we face in farm country, it is so important that we get together and we get this done. Today, our break-even for corn is $4.85, and I just said, right now, the market is giving you $4.04 a bushel in my hometown. I am not great at math, but that math does not make sense. That math is not sustainable. When you put the severe trade deficits that we are in right now on top of the climbing input costs that are out of our control that we have seen just insurmountable pressure, global pressure from supply chain disruptions to some of the unrest that we have seen, we have felt it in farm country. USDA forecast marketing your average is to be $4.30 and a statuary reference price is at $3.70. Again, the $3.70 reference price is not a break-even price. It is a hold on to our hat, can we make it one more year? And so, I mean, I have 50 seconds left, so, Dana, just what is your message to those that are unwilling to come to the table or still caught in the talking points of some framework versus actually getting to the point where we can get a farm bill done? What is your message? Dr. Allen-Tully. So the farm bill needs to be done this year. It is a rural community farm bill. It is not just the farm. There are different titles that affect all of us that live in the rural United States, and now is the time before the ball drops coming in the spring. Mr. Finstad. Yes, and I would totally agree. And, Mr. Chairman, I would just say, this is a farm bill that is for the farmer, written by the farmer, but also it is for our national security, so it is important now that we put the R and the D, rip them off our chest, put the USA back on, and we get a farm bill done. I yield back. Mr. Alford. Thank you. The chair now recognizes my good friend from California, Mr. Carbajal. Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to all the witnesses for being here today. Dr. Allen-Tully, last year, two atmospheric storms hit my district on the Central Coast of California, resulting in billions of dollars in loss of revenue. Farmers and producers in my district continue to feel the pain of natural disasters and the lack of Congressional action. Without Congressional action, can farmers and growers continue to stay economically viable? Dr. Allen-Tully. I am not so sure that all of them can. If we are losing 1,000 farmers a day, it would seem like we need a much stronger safety net in order to be able to have conversations with our bankers. Mr. Carbajal. Dr. Allen-Tully, when Secretary Vilsack was here, we discussed the importance of passing a farm bill and how most USDA disaster programs tend to be oversubscribed due to the increase in natural disasters. Can you elaborate on the consequences our farmers and growers can face should Congress not act in passing a farm bill this year? Just beating that drum a little bit more. Dr. Allen-Tully. Could you repeat the question? Mr. Carbajal. Can you elaborate on the consequences our farmers and growers can face should Congress not act in passing a farm bill this year? Dr. Allen-Tully. I think the simple consequences that we will not have operating loans renewed. There are some at that point where they wouldn't be able to move forward in a 2025 growing season and maybe not pay back their input costs for 2024. Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. Mr. Dunlow, as you may know, with the recent House farm bill that was marked up by this Committee, adjustments were made to eliminate the Secretary's Commodity Credit Corporation's discretionary authority. In the past, this authority has helped protect American farmers during disasters and other emergencies during both Republican and Democratic Administrations. In the previous Administration, farmers and growers suffered great economic impact due to trade wars. Should another trade war occur in the future, how will the lack of the Secretary's authority play a role in assisting American farmers during a disaster emergency? Mr. Dunlow. Thank you. I refer back to a good farm bill safety net helps with all of these to some point. And I can give you my experience from the last 40 years. Things get bad, prices go down, the safety net holds you there until things get better. Mr. Carbajal. So was the Credit Corporation's discretionary authority important? Mr. Dunlow. I think it is important, absolutely. It would seem the USDA has used it several times, and it has helped in those times for sure. Mr. Carbajal. Well, we know how slow Congress can move, and without that discretionary authority, I could see the disaster it would have on not being able to act in a nimble fashion to help our farmers. But with that, thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Rose  The gentleman yields. The chair now recognizes himself for 5 minutes. I want to thank Chairman Thompson for holding this important hearing, and thanks to each of our witnesses for taking time to be here with us today and share your expertise. Since 2021, high input costs, inflation, labor shortages, and other costs have crippled the agricultural industry and threatened our national security. Compared to 2023, net farm income is forecast to decrease by almost $40 billion this year, while production expenses are estimated to increase by over $16 billion. The bipartisan farm bill passed out of this Committee includes the tools needed to mitigate the financial crisis that is threatening agriculture and rural communities. I thank the Chairman for his diligent work on the legislation, and I look forward to working with Republicans and Democrats alike to get this bill across the finish line. Mr. Caldwell, we have had the privilege of knowing each other for a long time, and let's just say your hair color and my hair color we were a little different when we first met back a few decades ago. I am proud to have someone who considers Tennessee to be their native home testifying before the Committee today. In your written testimony, you mentioned the need to fill the agricultural worker shortage with H-2A temporary workers. Can you elaborate on the challenges facing farmers who rely on these temporary workers in light of the overwhelming annual increases in the adverse effect wage rate? Mr. Caldwell. Yes, I mean, it is a common issue across, and I am working in a ten state area, but I know it is broader than that. And when we talk to producers, the challenges for them to be able to find skilled labor locally, it continues. The H-2A program has allowed them to be able to access markets with individuals that are skilled in areas where they need skills. They need drivers, they need equipment operators, and they need general labor. So that has become, I would say, not only an important part of the labor force for them, I would say that it is a critical part of the labor force for them. Mr. Rose. Thank you. And that is what I am hearing from producers in my district back in Tennessee as well. And I will stick with you Mr. Caldwell. You also mentioned how regulatory uncertainty can negatively impact producers and retailers. Two weeks ago, this Committee held a hearing highlighting the consequences of the Environmental Protection Agency's recent actions. Disappointingly, but not surprisingly, EPA, Administrator Regan in this Administration is refusing to communicate with this Committee. Can you identify some of the issues caused by gaps in EPA's methodology that you as a retailer deal with and have a domino effect on farmers, and finally, and ultimately, the consumer? Mr. Caldwell. So, I will go back to the word uncertainty is really the thing that comes to mind more than anything else. We spend a lot of time with growers trying to plan and trying to plan for their cropping plans well in advance, and the uncertainty that comes with some of these regulatory issues where, oftentimes, we have last-minute changes or we have changes that are really critical to those operations, and in some cases, maybe not even substitutes. And then I would say a longer-term issue as we start talking about the Endangered Species Act and what we have seen is some of the first-run language and how we are going to implement that in the farm community, and a lot of those are just going to be really unreasonable for producers. And, in many cases, we are talking about products that are really critical for their production. Now, when you are squeezed for cost already, that just adds to that uncertainty. Mr. Rose. So I see my time is coming to an end, and so I will just stay with you, Mr. Caldwell. And we both remember back to the late 1970s, early 1980s when we were kids, the challenges the farm economy was facing at that time that farmers, producers were facing. How would you compare the challenge right now to the challenge that farmers faced in the early 1980s? Mr. Caldwell. So I would say it feels eerily familiar. Mr. Rose. I agree, and I think that it is something that we need to take note of. And thank you again for your time. And I see my time has expired, so I will yield. And next up is Mr. Nunn from Iowa. You are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Nunn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the Committee Members who are here today. Thank you for the panel for spending some time with us. I am from Iowa, second-largest ag state in the country. Grateful for your expertise on ag. We lead in pork, we lead in corn, we lead in eggs, we lead in biofuels. And like many of us here, we have a real concern about what is happening to our ag community because it is not just the family farm that is impacted by this, it is every rural community, it is every city in America, it is the security of our nation that is impacted by decisions made by Members of this Committee. For your testimony today, Dr. Allen-Tully, I want to begin by saying thank you for sharing your story of how your family has been impacted in Minnesota. It is something that I think Americans across the country are feeling the same. A bushel of corn today in my state runs about $3.96. For perspective, in 2022, that was at $6.54. Now, in order for that to be successful--that is a 60 percent decrease over the course of just about 24 months: $4.85 is where it has got to be to be successful, so farmers are digging in their pocket to be able to plant the crop that feeds and fuels this country at a deficit to themselves. I want to talk about the risk of continued price decline and how that would impact the nation. Specifically, what steps, Doctor, should Congress be taking, noting that the Senate has moved no legislation forward on a farm bill, and this chamber has moved forward a bipartisan piece of the farm bill to plan for the next 5 years for America? Dr. Allen-Tully. Well, we would hope that the Senate also moves their bill forward with a similar safety net that this body has passed out of Committee, the provisions in both the Title I and crop insurance really do work towards making a much stronger safety net than what we have currently. But it may not be soon enough, considering the state at where we are at in July of 2024. So a lot will be determined in terms of yield losses in the next 4 weeks. I am from Minnesota, but Iowa has faced similar challenges, North Dakota, Illinois, Indiana, South Dakota, and so I think that there may be some significant crop insurance claims that come about both from price and yield. Mr. Nunn. I would agree with you. It also begins the conversation here on what we are trying to do to help grow the family farm. In my district, 87,000 family farms. Now, in Iowa, the average age of a farmer is 57. I imagine Minnesota, across the country, that is not too different. In fact, more than 58,000 of those 85,000 farms are run by farmers who are well over 65. So salute to their service. It is also an unfair expectation that that generation of Americans continues to be the best vanguard we have to feed and fuel the country. It is one of the reasons that I am proud to work with my colleague on the other side of the aisle here, Nikki Budzinski, who I will note has more soybeans than we do. It is one of the only areas Illinois is beating us. But over this course we have introduced H.R. 3955, the Increasing Land Access, Security, and Opportunities Act to really make sure that we have a good set of incentives for that next generation of young and beginning farmers to be successful, one, so we can save the family farm, save rural communities, but also to make sure that everybody in big cities has the opportunity to eat and that our country has the ability to maintain energy independence. I want to highlight here that this bill would specifically provide credit for small and beginning farmers. Mr. Hotchkiss, would you agree that these type of policies are not only helpful for our farmers but essential for our country? Mr. Hotchkiss. Absolutely. Thank you for the question, and absolutely. We have to come together and help give incentives, help give reasons for people that are younger than our current average age--I will say it that way--to enter into the farming sector, and we do that through having good, solid safety nets, good programs at USDA, Acts like ACRE that I know you are familiar with, ways to help them manage and control costs and manage risks because, as I said earlier and I will say again, if I am a 25 year old that has been farming or working on a farm and wanting to start out on my own and I am seeing everyone not having safety nets and not making money, I am not going to be as encouraged to step out and try it on my own as I would if those things existed. Mr. Nunn. Let alone take out a mortgage that could devastate you and your family for generations. Mr. Hotchkiss. Absolutely. Mr. Nunn. These are the things that are important. I am glad that this Committee has moved a bipartisan bill forward to help young and beginning farmers, to help provide the safety net. I ask that we encourage our colleagues across the Rotunda to do the same. With that, I yield my time back, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Mr. Rose. The gentleman yields, and the chair recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. Duarte, for 5 minutes. Mr. Duarte. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the panelists today. I am a farmer from California. I am taking on more debt than I had last year, not digging out, digging in, and I hear from many of my good friends, long-term farm families around the Modesto, California, area in the central San Joaquin Valley, as well as banks, that we have a crisis at hand. I mean, I was not offended that we are talking about soybeans and cotton and corn today because, move the numbers around, move the words around, move the crops around, it is the same story. In fact, Mr. Hotchkiss touched on almonds in his testimony. So we have a banking crisis, and we have the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ratcheting down lending standards, ratcheting down bank flexibility at a time when we can least afford it. So I stand with all of the thoughts today and comments on giving some banks flexibility. But at the end of the day, if a bank is lending to customers who are losing money and can't show a path towards making money, banking standards aren't really the solution. Markets and prices are what we have to look at. So I would like to use an example for almonds right now. This year in 2023, this last year, Australia exported 55,000 tons of almonds to China. That is up from 33,330 tons in 2018, as our trade wars took place. Australia has a 0 percent tariffs exporting almonds into China. We have a 25 percent retaliatory ag tariff alone exporting almonds into China. Our retaliatory agricultural tariffs against American exports, I believe, are the main driver of our farm surpluses and our low prices here in America. In 2019, we put through a Market Facilitation Program out of the Commodity Credit Corporation that was a $23 billion program--it would be over $30 billion today with inflation--to stabilize ag markets, but it didn't target exporters. It gave money to all the farmers. So what do all farmers do when they have more of government's money, their own money, or your money? We planted more crops. We didn't incentivize exports. So if we were to put together--a proposal I have put forth to the Secretary of Agriculture, which is within his authority, I call it the Market Facilitation Retaliatory Ag Tariff Supplement, MFRATS. For about $6-$7 billion a year, we could offset entirely the retaliatory ag tariffs imposed by our trading partners since 2018 on an annual basis. This would be cheap compared to the ag lending crisis that we are facing, which will well go into the hundreds of billions of dollars if we start to have a cascading of land values and foreclosures in the next year, which is here. And the farm bill will not be passed in time to rescue this, I am sorry to say. It is a great bill. The Chairman did a great job. We passed a great bill. It is not going to come to save us in time. It just isn't. So I am looking for support for the MFRATS, Market Facilitation Retaliatory Ag Tariffs Supplement, and let's make no question about this. We are taking the gloves off. We can't attribute the trade wars we are in to one President. We have a President currently who wants to put tariffs on every Chinese electric vehicle sent to America. These trade wars aren't going anywhere. We won a 5 year lawsuit in the World Trade Organization against China's retaliatory ag tariffs this year, and it has made no difference in their policy discriminating against American agricultural production. So I will leave it to the panel. I will open it up. I have almost a minute left. Who is with me? Do we go down this road? Do we take the gloves off, and do we do something that will deliver immediate relief? Or do we wait for something else? Gentlemen, ladies? Mr. Dunlow. Well, I will just speak on--I have constantly said it throughout this hearing. We desperately need help, and we desperately need it now. We are on the verge of a crisis all across the U.S., and waiting for farm bill, extending the farm bill is not the answer. Mr. Duarte. Mr. Hotchkiss, you know something about almonds? Mr. Hotchkiss. I know very little, but I would need to know more about this specific topic. Then I could speak more. Mr. Duarte. Thank you. Any other comments? Dr. Allen-Tully. I would agree that we would be interested in learning more about the proposal that you are putting forward. Mr. Duarte. My office has a letter prepared for the Secretary of Agriculture, and we are looking for support on it. I will yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the panel. The Chairman  The gentleman's time has expired. I now recognize the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Davis, for 5 minutes. Mr. Davis of North Carolina. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, always good to see you, and thank you and Ranking Member Scott for organizing this really important hearing today. And I want to thank the witnesses, and one in particular there is no escaping me, Mr. Dunlow. Always good to see you and to see an eastern North Carolinian here in Washington, D.C. You are brave, sir. The financial situation of our farmers is top of mind. In eastern North Carolina, our top industry is agriculture. The jobs tied to agriculture directly impacts our local grocery stores, our local banks, even our local tractor store. And Congress must do everything possible to help keep our farmers in business and on good financial footing. Farmers in eastern North Carolina and across the country are caught between a rock and a hard place. They are taking on more debt just trying to stay in business. Year after year, we are faced with selling the farm. Mr. Dunlow, can you speak on access to cash-flow and the challenges farm families are facing as it relates to this? Mr. Dunlow. Yes, sir. I will reiterate the fact of where we are at with this 2018 Farm Bill does not provide support as what I have been used to over the last 40 years. And I referenced earlier the farm bill that was passed out of the House Agriculture Committee, it meets most of our needs, but even at that, if it was passed today, it would be 2025 for discovery price, and it will be fall of 2026 receiving funds. So with that being said--and I know it is kind of beating the same drum, but we are on the verge of a crisis. I really believe. And hearing testimonies today, I think we are on the verge of crisis throughout the U.S. ag industry. Mr. Davis of North Carolina. Have prices changed this year in terms of input prices versus prices of commodities that you are growing? Mr. Dunlow. Well, just this year since January, most commodity prices have fallen 12 to 15 percent just in the last few months, and we are still at these prices not earning a payment with the safety net that we currently have. Mr. Davis of North Carolina. I think it is important that everyone on this Committee understands the mood out there in farm country. When you talk with other farmers back home, just like I have and we have spoken to each other and them, what do you hear at that country store or out on the farm just standing talking to someone at the farm? Mr. Dunlow. I will use this example. I am Chairman of the American Cotton Producers. In my first meeting that I conducted, I went out on a limb and kind of shared with them some of my problems, my financial troubles, no cash flowing, and we had members that represented all the cotton throughout the U.S., 17 states. And I said if anyone else in here has heard of anybody having these experiences, a little bit of trouble with just show of hands, and every single producer in there raised his hands. So that is what we are facing. Mr. Davis of North Carolina. Well, I want to thank you for being here again and just sharing a perspective. And I do believe it is highly important for the Committee to engage, for Congress to engage and understand the challenges that many are facing out there--and I hear you loud and clear--short of a crisis. So thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. The Chairman. The gentleman yields back. I am now pleased to recognize the gentlelady from Texas, Congresswoman De la Cruz, for 5 minutes. Ms. De La Cruz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to the witnesses for being here today. We do appreciate this. Technology plays a key role in connecting consumers with the services that they desire. There are few industries where this is more critical than financial services. While relationships are the backbone of our community banks and credit unions, technology enhances the capability of all lenders to provide services to customers. It is a big opportunity for smaller community banks and credit unions to gain access to beneficial financial technologies like AI. And I apologize because I am actually in the wrong committee right now. I am in Agriculture Committee, and I apologize for that. As we are talking about things that are pertaining to the Agriculture Committee, I do want to talk about the agriculture sector, which in my district, being mostly Hispanics sector and a rural sector, agriculture plays nearly 20 percent of the United States' economic activity. And that means that the sector represents more than $9 trillion in output, yielding over $181 billion in exports and accounts for more than 48 million jobs that pay nearly $3 trillion in wages. However, lack of market expansion collapsing on-farm prices and increasing input prices are making life for farmers very difficult. On top of this, many farmers in my district in the Rio Grande Valley are suffering from water shortages due to Mexico not delivering water they owe under the 1944 water treaty. The lack of consistent water deliveries on top of increased costs and high interest rates puts Texas farmers and Texas agriculture at risk. So my question is this. High interest rates are a concern for any small business, but perhaps none more so than our farmers, many of whom rely on financing for annual operating expenses. Does any witness want to share their perspective on how big of an impact the doubling of interest rates over the past couple of years has had on the ag sector for specifically your area of expertise? We will start with corn. Mr. Dunlow. I would speak to that a little bit. There again, in my situation, in the last 2 or 3 years, as we have come up short, the crops are not paying out, I have had to go and refinance some farmland. So that in turn, you are paying interest on back debt, along with interest on your loan next year. And both of those interest rates have doubled. So it is just a snowball effect. Once you get in trouble, it is very difficult to get back on top. Ms. De La Cruz. So thank you for that. And I would like to expand on that for just a second because, as you know, I am on the Financial Services Committee, and I came from that hearing over to this hearing. And there is a lot of overlap. And we have, on my side of the aisle, done a lot pushing back on the Basel III proposal that could negatively impact our farmers. Can any of you all explain how the impact of the Basel III will have on the farming sector? Mr. Hotchkiss. Thank you for the question. I had spoken to that a little earlier. In its simplest form, the requirements under Basel III will increase costs to banks, which will be passed on to their producers, and that is just one more cost that they are going to have to increase costs of what they will have to manage, in addition to the interest rates, which you have already brought up, and input costs, land costs, labor costs, et cetera. So that increases costs as well as the--from a banking perspective, the increased capital requirements that Basel III brings is just something that we would support it going back to the Prudential Regulators for reconsideration. Ms. De La Cruz. Thank you. I yield back. The Chairman. The gentlelady yields back. I am now pleased to recognize gentlelady from Oregon, Congresswoman Chavez-DeRemer for 5 minutes. Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon. Thank you for being here, and thank you for allowing me to be one of the last to ask questions and visiting with you today. My first question, Mr. Hotchkiss, in your testimony you mentioned that over half of young farmers say they need access to more land. Can you talk to me about the young farmers you see entering bank branches? Are you seeing any trends toward younger and first-generation farmers getting involved in farming and thereby accessing credit? Mr. Hotchkiss. Thank you for the question. We do see young farmers. They come in. It is generally someone who is from a farm, might have been farming with their father, their uncle, their grandparents, and are wanting to break away and start something, set their own legacy forward. And it is really a struggle. It is hard for them to get started and to obtain the credit they need without the programs that are available through either USDA in the farm bill--I want to thank this Committee again for proposing increased limits, separating operating from real estate that allows enough access to credit with a guarantee behind it that can help those young farmers. The downpayment assistance program is something that is going to aid those young farmers to get into the business. But, as I have also said, one of the most difficult things to deal with is they will come in and they will talk about their operating budgets and their struggle to be able to themselves put together a reasonable operating budget because it just doesn't pencil out. The costs are so high. And so, to me, that is why not only is the farm bill so important for this year because it brings certainty not only to the farmer, but brings certainty to the financing side, and it needs to be passed. We don't need an extension. We need something that can help now and go forward. And then also, last, I would just say support for ACRE, which is a way to reduce costs not only for young farmers, but for all farmers. Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. Sure. Well, I am going to follow up a little bit on interest rates since we are talking specific to people accessing credit and what that looks like. We are talking about homeownership, not only purchase of land, but homeownership, a distant dream for many Americans and certainly young Americans, as we are seeing across every sector. Coming from a state with an affordable housing shortage and a homelessness crisis, the issue is top of mind for me in Oregon. Aside from those high interest rates, can you speak to the obstacles that also stand in the way of rural Americans purchasing homes? Mr. Hotchkiss. It is availability and sometimes cost. But once again, unfortunately, I will reference back to the ACRE Act. It is not just ag real estate, it is residential mortgages in rural communities of 2,500 or less, and that would help reduce the interest cost and allow a lot more people to qualify for mortgages. Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. Okay. Well, I am going to move on just a little bit to Dr. Allen-Tully and Mr. Dunlow. Thank you both for your passionate remarks earlier, and frankly, your honesty. We are repeatedly told that conditions in farm country are not great, but to hear your on-the-ground perspective as producers who are seeing the effects of low commodity prices and rising input prices, it really sends a message home. It has been noted that as production expenses are forecast to remain the highest in history, producers will be forced to rely on increasingly more debt. With these added pressures, it seems all but inevitable that the mental health of farmers and ranchers will be strongly affected for an industry that already has high suicide rates. My question for you both is what can be done to improve mental health for our farmers and reach them before it is too late? Dr. Allen-Tully. Thank you for the question. I certainly think that, as we move through this fall and into the winter and spring, we are going to need to be able to reach out to farmers. In Minnesota, we actually have a dedicated line for farmers to call into that are experiencing some mental health concerns, and there are a series of counselors that they would be able to access. And so I would say that something to that effect is going to be important across the country. Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. We are seeing it more now. Mr. Dunlow, do you have anything to add? Mr. Dunlow. Yes, just a quick comment. Talking to one of my friends who he had a friend that went out of farming because the financial situation, and actually, he was helping talk him out of doing something like that. So I would certainly encourage this Committee to move forward to advertise the resources that someone can call and get help with. Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. Yes. And for any farmer or rancher or any industry as well, when things are tough, accessing credit pain, your families are counting on you, and that pressure on your shoulders is hard when you know that other families and their children are counting on you as well. So I am about out of time. I did want to bring up Agricultural Labor Working Group that we recently had, and I was proud to be a part of that effort. And while the Agriculture Committee does not have jurisdiction over ag labor, we are invested and interested in meaningful reform to the ag labor workforce. So I will hold my last question, but just know that that is on top of mind for me as well. And I thank you all for being here today and sharing your perspectives. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. The Chairman. The gentlelady yields back. Seeing no other of our Members here for additional questions, I will just proceed with some closing comments. I want to say thank you to all five of our witnesses, you know what, for bringing your experiences here to Washington because we do our jobs better when we use what God has given us, and that is two ears and one mouth, when we make the effort to listen and to listen to the voices of rural America or what I call an essential America today and, quite frankly, the agriculture industry, which all of you represent in different ways sitting at the table. I think the points that you made were crystal clear, and I think that they reinforced the need to get this farm bill passed. Now, we have had a lot of naysayers in this process. We had the naysayers who said we would never be able to put a farm bill together. Well, we proved them wrong. They said we will never be able to pass it out of Committee. Well, we proved them wrong. They said we will never be able to do this in a bipartisan way, and we proved them wrong. And there are those who are saying we will never get to the House floor, and I guarantee you, we will prove them wrong, and the reason for that is the arguments that you have made of why this is important to do now, to provide that certainty, to show our farmers, our ranchers, our foresters, our processors, the people of rural America, that we have their backs and that we stand ready to provide them what they need. And that is what the Farm, Food, and National Security Act of 2024 is. And so I really, really appreciate your making the sacrifices you made to be able to travel here and to be able to share your insights and expertise. Under the Rules of the Committee, the record of today's hearing will remain open for 10 calendar days to receive additional material and supplementary written responses from the witnesses to any question posed by a Member. This hearing of the Committee on Agriculture is adjourned.   Submitted Letter by Hon. Glenn Thompson, a Representative in Congress from Pennsylvania; on behalf of Todd Van Hoose, President and Chief Executive Officer, Farm Credit Council July 23, 2024 Hon. Glenn Thompson, Hon. David Scott, Chairman, Ranking Minority Member, House Committee on Agriculture, House Committee on Agriculture, Washington, D.C.; Washington, D.C. Dear Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member Scott: On behalf of our over 600,000 customers across all 50 states and Puerto Rico, Farm Credit thanks you for holding today's hearing to assess the financial conditions farmers, ranchers, and rural communities currently face. As the leading lender to agriculture, Farm Credit is committed to fulfilling our mission to serve our customers in good times and bad. As recent USDA reports have outlined, producers are facing a more challenging economic environment, and those conditions are expected to continue to deteriorate as we enter the 2025 growing season. Farm Credit has also seen troubling signs of more difficult times to come. Farmers' net cash income was significantly reduced from 2023 to 2024. In addition, due to inflation, input costs remain high, and farmers' working capital has been reduced. This has led to a slight increase in borrowers facing financial stress. These headwinds are even more detrimental to young and beginning farmers who already struggle to get started. Farm Credit has robust programs to specifically support young, beginning, and small (YBS) producers, which have resulted in year-over- year increases in YBS customers. The certainty a farm bill brings is crucial to the survival of these operations. Finally, if land values were to falter in some parts of the country, the situation could become increasingly dire for many producers. Producers rely on the risk management programs included in the farm bill when faced with adverse weather, trade uncertainty, disease outbreaks, and economic environments like those we are beginning to see now. It is more important than ever to pass the farm bill in 2024 to provide farmers, ranchers and rural communities with the certainty they will need to stay afloat if current economic conditions persist or worsen. As you will hear from today's witnesses, having access to vital risk management tools like crop insurance, Title I programs, trade promotion tools, and other strong farm policies will be an important factor in whether farmers and ranchers are able to survive a downturn. Your commitment to hearing from these producers is commendable, and it is Farm Credit's hope that this hearing will help all Members of the House Agriculture Committee become even more committed to passing the farm bill this year. Thank you again for holding this important hearing and for your continued support of Farm Credit and our mission to support rural communities and agriculture with reliable, consistent, credit and related services today and tomorrow. Farm Credit stands ready to help get the farm bill done this year. Sincerely,     ______ Submitted Article by Hon. Austin Scott, a Representative in Congress from Georgia   John Deere announces mass layoffs in Midwest amid production shift to Mexico By Michael Dorgan Published June 29, 2024, 11:16 a.m. PDT Business,\1\ FOX Business \2\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ https://www.fox13seattle.com/tag/business. \2\ Ahttps://www.foxbusiness.com/.  File--A John Deere combine harvests grain corn and unloads into a grain cart. (Photo by: Bill Barksdale/Design Pics --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Editorial/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) John Deere, the world's largest seller of tractors and crop harvesters,\3\ has announced another wave of layoffs Friday, telling around 610 production staff at plants in Illinois and Iowa that they will be out of a job by the end of the summer, according to reports. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \3\ https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/fox-news-manufacturing. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The company is slashing around 280 workers from a plant in East Moline, Illinois, while another 230 employees are being let go at a factory in Davenport, Iowa. About 100 production employees at the company's Dubuque, Iowa, plant will also be impacted. All layoffs are said to be effective from Aug. 30, per a press release cited by several outlets. According to the release, the layoffs are being made due to reduced demand for John Deere's products \4\ from those factories. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \4\ https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/john-deere. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The company says it generated $10.166 billion in profits last year. ``We can confirm Deere leadership recently communicated that rising operational costs and declining market demand requires enterprise-wide changes in how work gets done to achieve our goals and best position the company for the future,'' the statement reads. Workers are to be offered Supplemental Unemployment Benefit (SUB) which will cover about 95% of their weekly net pay for up to 26 weeks, depending on their years of service. They are also being given profit- sharing options and health benefits. Deere, known for its iconic green and yellow colors and jumping deer logo, is one of America's oldest companies, having been established in 1837, nearly 25 years before the start of the Civil War. Earlier this month, Deere announced it is moving the manufacturing of skid steer loaders and compact track loaders from its Dubuque facility to Mexico by the end of 2026. The company said the decision was due to it evolving its business model and to address rising manufacturing costs and improve operational efficiencies. ``This includes optimizing our factories for future products, making our operations more efficient and taking advantage of locations in the U.S. and globally, with a growing labor force,'' a statement from the company reads. In October, John Deere announced its first wave of 225 layoffs at its Harvester Works plant in East Moline. Another 34 production employees were laid off in May at its Moline Cylinder Works factory, while in March, company officials announced that they would lay off 150 more workers at a plant in Ankeny, Iowa, where sprayers and cotton pickers are made. About 500 employees have been let go at its Waterloo plant in Iowa, per WQAD. One longtime John Deere worker at the Harvester Works plant in East Moline, blamed the latest announcement on greed. ``We get wind of more layoffs daily, it seems, and it's causing uncertainty all over,'' said the worker, who wished to remain anonymous. ``The only reason for Deere to do this is greed.'' Deere & Co's market capitalization \5\ stood around $102.81 billion as of Friday evening. In mid-May, the company said it had generated $27.42 billion in net sales and revenues over the first two quarters of the year. Its net income for the same timeframe was $4.121 billion. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \5\ https://www.foxbusiness.com/quote?stockTicker=DE. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The company recently trimmed its annual profit forecast for the second time and projected steeper declines in sales of large agricultural equipment. Lower crop prices are leaving agricultural equipment sellers with an excess of unsold tractors and combines, leading some to offer discounts and suspend new orders. The Department of Agriculture has also forecast farm income would slide 25.5% to $116.1 billion this year from 2023. The news of layoffs comes amid a report on Wednesday \6\ that John Deere CEO John May has put his 80 acre horse farm property up for sale. Its asking price has been set at $3.925 million, according to its listing. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \6\ https://www.foxbusiness.com/real-estate/john-deere-ceo-puts-80- acre-horse-farm-up-sale.

Department of Agriculture Daren Bakst American farmers efficiently and safely produce food to meet the needs of individuals around the globe. Because of the innovation and resilience of the nation's farmers, American agriculture is a model for the world. If farmers are allowed to operate without unnecessary government intervention, American agriculture will continue to flourish, producing plentiful, safe, nutritious, and affordable food. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) can and should play a limited role, with much of its focus on removing governmental barriers that hinder food production or otherwise undermine efforts to meet consumer demand. The USDA should recognize what should be self-evident: Agricultural production should first and foremost be focused on efficiently producing safe food. This chapter provides important background on the USDA and identifies many of the USDA-specific issues that will be faced by an incoming Administration. It provides specific recommendations for the next Administration about how to address these issues and lays out a conservative vision for what the USDA should look like in the future. Mission Statement The current mission statement as stated by the Biden Administration highlights the broad scope of the USDA: To serve all Americans by providing effective, innovative, science-based public policy leadership in agriculture, food and nutrition, natural resource protection and management, rural development, and related issues with a commitment to delivering equitable and climate smart opportunities that inspire and help America thrive.\1\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, Fiscal Year 2023 Budget Summary, p. 1, https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2023- usda-budget-summary.pdf (accessed December 14, 2022). The first part of the mission statement regarding the issues covered is not new to the Biden Administration; it reflects the overly broad nature of the USDA's work. However, the language bringing in equity and climate change is new to the Biden Administration and part of the USDA's express effort to transform agricultural production.\2\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \2\ See, for example, U.S. Department of Agriculture, ``Transforming the U.S. Food System,'' https://www.usda.gov/fst (accessed December 14, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The USDA's new vision statement illuminates the focus of this effort: An equitable and climate smart food and agriculture economy that protects and improves the health, nutrition and quality of life of all Americans, yields healthy land, forests and clean water, helps rural America thrive, and feeds the world.\3\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \3\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, Fiscal Year 2023 Budget Summary, p. 1. This effort is one of a Federal central plan to put climate change and environmental issues ahead of the most important requirements of agriculture--to efficiently produce safe food. The USDA would apparently use its power to change the very nature of the food and agriculture economy into one that is ``equitable and climate-smart.'' As an initial matter, the USDA should not try to control and shape the economy, but should instead remove obstacles that hinder food production. Further, it should not place ancillary issues, such as environmental issues, ahead of agricultural production itself. A Proper Mission Statement. Even before the Biden Administration's radical effort to reshape the USDA's work, the USDA's mission was and is too broad, including serving as a major welfare agency through implementation of programs such as food stamps. This far-reaching mission is not the fault of the USDA, but of Congress, which has given the department its extensive power. Congress must limit the USDA's role. A proper mission would clarify that the department's primary focus is on agriculture and that the USDA serves all Americans. The USDA's ``client'' is the American people in general, not a subset of interests, such as farmers, meatpackers, environmental groups, etc. Within this agricultural focus, the USDA should develop and disseminate information and research (the historical role of the USDA); identify and address concrete threats to public health and safety arising directly from food and agriculture; remove unjustified foreign trade barriers blocking market access for American agricultural goods; and generally remove government barriers that undermine access to safe and affordable food across the food supply chain. Core principles should be included within any mission statement, including a recognition that farmers, and the food system in general, should be free from unnecessary government intervention. Further, there should be clear statements about the importance of sound science to inform the USDA's work and respect for personal freedom and individual dietary choices, private property rights, and the rule of law. Taking these factors into account, below is a model USDA mission statement: To develop and disseminate agricultural information and research, identify and address concrete public health and safety threats directly connected to food and agriculture, and remove both unjustified foreign trade barriers for U.S. goods and domestic government barriers that undermine access to safe and affordable food absent a compelling need--all based on the importance of sound science, personal freedom, private property, the rule of law, and service to all Americans. Overview In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed into law the legislation that created the USDA.\4\ The department had a very narrow mission focused on the dissemination of information connected to agriculture and ``to procure, propagate and distribute among the people new valuable seeds and plants.'' \5\ During the last 160 years, the scope of the USDA's work has expanded well beyond that narrow mission--and well beyond agriculture itself. In addition to being a distributor of farm subsidies, the USDA runs the food stamp program and other food- related welfare programs and covers issues including conservation, biofuels, forestry, and rural programs. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \4\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, ``USDA Celebrates 150 Years,'' https://www.usda.gov/our-agency/about-usda/history (accessed December 16, 2022). \5\ The law stated, ``here is hereby established at the seat of government of the United States a Department of Agriculture, the general designs and duties of which shall be to acquire and to diffuse among the people of the United States useful information on subjects connected with agriculture in the most general and comprehensive sense of that word, and to procure, propagate, and distribute among the people new and valuable seeds and plants.'' Gladys L. Baker, et al., Century of Service: The First 100 Years of the United States Department of Agriculture, (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1963) p. 13, https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/ pt?id=uc1.b4254098&view=1up&seq=33 (accessed December 16, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Based on the USDA's Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 budget summary, outlays are estimated at $261 billion: $221 billion for mandatory programs and $39 billion for discretionary programs.\6\ These outlays are broken down as follows: nutrition assistance (70 percent); farm, conservation, and commodity programs (14 percent); ``all other,'' which includes rural development, research, food safety, marketing and regulatory, and departmental management (11 percent); and forestry (5 percent).\7\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \6\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, Fiscal Year 2023 Budget Summary, p. 2. \7\ Ibid., p. 2. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The USDA has provided a summary of its size, explaining, ``Today, USDA is comprised of 29 agencies organized under eight Mission Areas and 16 Staff Offices, with nearly 100,000 employees serving the American people at more than 6,000 locations across the country and abroad.'' \8\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \8\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, Strategic Plan: Fiscal Years 2022-2026, p. 3, https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ usda-fy-2022-2026-strategic-plan.pdf (accessed December 14, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Major Priority Issues and Specific Recommendations For an incoming Administration, there are numerous issues that should be addressed at the USDA. This chapter identifies and discusses many of the most important issues. The initial issues discussed should be priority issues for the next Administration: Defend American Agriculture. It is deeply unfortunate that the first issue identified must be a willingness of the incoming Administration to defend American agriculture, but this is precisely what the top priority for that Administration should be. As previously discussed, the Biden Administration is seeking to use the Federal Government to transform the American food system.\9\ The USDA web site explains: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \9\ News release, ``USDA Announces Framework for Shoring Up the Food Supply Chain and Transforming the Food System to Be Fairer, More Competitive, More Resilient,'' U.S. Department of Agriculture, June 1, 2022, https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2022/06/01/usda- announces-framework-shoring-food-supply-chain-and-transforming (accessed December 14, 2022). The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), alongside Biden- Harris Administration leadership and the people of this great country, has embarked on another historic journey: transforming the food system as we know it--from farm to fork, and at every stage along the supply chain.\10\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \10\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, ``Transforming the U.S. Food System.'' The Federal Government does not need to transform the food system or develop a national plan to intervene across the supply chain. Instead, it should respect American farmers, truckers, and everyone who makes the food supply chain so resilient and successful. One of the important lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic was how critical it is to remove barriers in the food supply chain--not to increase them. The Biden Administration's centrally planned transformational effort minimizes the importance of efficient agricultural production and instead places issues such as climate change and equity front and center. The USDA's Strategic Plan Fiscal Years 2022-2026 identifies six strategic goals, the first three of which focus on issues such as climate change, renewable energy, and systemic racism. In the Secretary of Agriculture's message, there is only one mention of affordable food--and nothing about efficient production and the incredible innovation and respect for the environment that already exists within the agricultural community.\11\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \11\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, Strategic Plan: Fiscal Years 2022-2026, pp. 1-2. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Biden Administration's USDA strongly supported \12\ the recent United Nations (U.N.) Food Systems Summit. According to the USDA: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \12\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, ``Background on the U.S. Approach to the 2021 UN Food Systems Summit,'' August 4, 2021, https:// www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Background-on-US-approach- 2021-UN-Food-Systems-Summit.pdf (accessed December 14, 2022). The stated goal of the Food Systems Summit was to transform the way the world produces, consumes and thinks about foods within the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to meet the challenges of poverty, food security, malnutrition, population growth, climate change, and natural resource degradation.\13\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \13\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, ``UN Food Systems Summit,'' https://www.usda.gov/oce/sustainability/un-summit (accessed December 14, 2022). Not unlike those who oppose reliable and affordable energy production, there is a disdain, especially by some on the Left, for American agriculture and the food system.\14\ The Biden Administration's vision of a Federal Government developing a plan that ``fixes'' agriculture and focuses on issues secondary to food production is very disturbing. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \14\ Mark Bittman, et al., ``How a National Food Policy Could Save Millions of American Lives,'' The Washington Post, November 7, 2014, https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-a-national-food-policy- could-save-millions-of-american-lives/2014/11/07/89c55e16-637f-11e4- 836c-83bc4f26eb67_story.html (accessed December 14, 2022); Daren Bakst and Gabriella Beaumont-Smith, ``No, We Don't Need to Transform the American Food System,'' The Daily Signal, February 26, 2021, https:// www.dailysignal.com/2021/02/26/no-we-dont-need-to-transform-the- american-food-system/ (accessed December 14, 2022); and Daren Bakst, ``Biden's Food Conference Should Put People First, Not Environmental Extremism,'' The Daily Signal, September 22, 2022, https:// www.dailysignal.com/2022/09/22/bidens-food-conference-should-put- people-first-not-environmental-extremism/ (accessed December 14, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A recent USDA-created program captures both the disrespect for American farmers and the Biden Administration's effort to dictate agricultural practices. The USDA explained that it was concerned with farmers not transitioning to organic farming, and therefore announced that it will dedicate $300 million to induce farmers to adopt organic farming.\15\ There was no recognition that farmers know how to farm better than D.C. politicians \16\ or a that organic food is expensive \17\ and land-intensive.\18\ The Biden Administration has also been pushing so-called ``climate-smart'' \19\ agricultural practices which received additional support in the partisan Inflation Reduction Act.\20\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \15\ News release, ``USDA to Invest Up to $300 Million in New Organic Transition Initiative,'' U.S. Department of Agriculture, August 22, 2022, https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2022/08/22/usda- invest-300-million-new-organic-transition-initiative (accessed December 14, 2022). \16\ Gary Baise, ``Sri Lanka's Green New Deal Was a Disaster,'' Farm Futures, November 14, 2022, https://www.farmprogress.com/ commentary/sri-lankas-green-new-deal-was-disaster (accessed December 16, 2022). \17\ See, for example, Catherine Greene, et al., ``Growing Organic Demand Provides High-Value Opportunities for Many Types of Producers,'' Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, February 6, 2017, https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2017/januaryfebruary/ growing-organic-demand-provides-high-value-opportunities-for-many- types-of-producers/ (accessed December 14, 2022), and Andrea Carlson, ``Investigating Retail Price Premiums for Organic Foods,'' Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, May 24, 2016, https:/ /www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2016/may/investigating-retail-price- premiums-for-organic-foods/ (accessed December 16, 2022). Further, there are many myths, such as those regarding the alleged health benefit of organic food. One meta study found that ``he published literature lacks strong evidence that organic foods are significantly more nutritious than conventional foods.'' Crystal Smith-Spangler, et al., ``Are Organic Foods Safer or Healthier Than Conventional Alternatives,'' Annals of Internal Medicine, Vol. 157, No. 5 (September 4, 2012), pp. 348-366, https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/epdf/10.7326/ 0003-4819-157-5-201209040-00007 (accessed December 16, 2022). \18\ Steve Savage, ``USDA Data Confirm Organic Yields Significantly Lower Than With Conventional Farming,'' Genetic Literacy Project, February 16, 2018, https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2018/02/16/usda- data-confirm-organic-yields-dramatically-lower-conventional-farming/ (accessed December 16, 2022). \19\ See, for example, U.S. Department of Agriculture, ``Notice: Climate-Smart Agriculture and Forestry Partnership Program, Request for Comments,'' USDA-2021-0010, October 21, 2021, https:// www.regulations.gov/document/USDA-2021-0010-0001 (accessed December 16, 2022). \20\ Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Public Law 117-169. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- American agriculture should not need defending. According to the USDA's latest data, farm output nearly tripled (a 175 percent increase) from 1948 to 2019, while the amount of land farmed decreased. In fact, as farm output increased by 175 percent, all agricultural inputs increased by only four percent.\21\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \21\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, ``Productivity Growth in U.S. Agriculture (1948-2019),'' https:// www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/agricultural-productivity-in-the-u-s/ productivity-growth-in-u-s-agriculture-1948-2019/ (accessed December 14, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In 2021, despite high food prices--a major problem and regressive-- American consumers spent an average of about ten percent of their personal disposable income on food, which is close to historic lows. For decades, this share has been in decline.\22\ America's farmers efficiently produce food using fewer resources, making it possible for food to be affordable. This reality is not only something that should be defended but also touted as a prime example of what makes American agriculture so successful. The connection between efficiency and affordability seems lost in the Biden Administration's effort to transform the food system. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \22\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, ``Total Food Budget Share Increased from 9.4 Percent of Disposable Income to 10.3 Percent in 2021,'' July 15, 2022, https:// www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/ ?chartId=76967 (accessed December 14, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Recommendations Proactively Defend Agriculture. From the outset, the next Administration should: Denounce efforts to place ancillary issues like climate change ahead of food productivity and affordability when it comes to agriculture. Remove the U.S. from any association with U.N. and other efforts to push sustainable-development schemes connected to food production. Defend American agriculture and advance the critical importance of efficient and innovative food production, especially to advance safe and affordable food. Stress that ideal policy should remove obstacles imposed on American farmers and individuals across the food supply chain so that they can meet the food needs of Americans. Clarify the critical importance of efficiency to food affordability, and why a failure to recognize this fact especially hurts low-income households who spend a disproportionate share of after-tax income on food compared to higher-income households.\23\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \23\ U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, ``Quintiles of Income Before Taxes: Annual Expenditure Means, Shares, and Standard Errors, and Coefficients of Variation, Consumer Expenditure Surveys,'' 2021, Table 1101, https://www.bls.gov/cex/ tables/calendar-year/mean-item-share-average-standard-error/cu-income- quintiles-before-taxes-2021.pdf (accessed December 16, 2022), and Daren Bakst and Patrick Tyrrell, ``Big Government Policies That Hurt the Poor and How to Address Them,'' Heritage Foundation Special Report No. 176, April 5, 2017, p. 7, https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/2017- 04/SR176.pdf. To accomplish these objectives, a new Administration should announce its principles through an executive order, the USDA should remove all references to transforming the food system on its web site and other department-disseminated material, and it should expressly and regularly communicate the principles informing the objectives listed above, as well as promote these principles through legislative efforts. The USDA should also carefully review existing efforts that involve inappropriately imposing its preferred agricultural practices onto farmers. Address the Abuse of CCC Discretionary Authority. With the exception of Federal crop insurance, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is generally the means by which agricultural-related farm bill programs are funded. The CCC is a funding mechanism, which, in simple terms, has $30 billion a year at its disposal.\24\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \24\ Daren Bakst and Joshua Sewell, ``Congress Should Stop Abrogating Its Spending Power and Rein in the USDA Slush Fund,'' Heritage Foundation Issue Brief No. 6052, February 19, 2021, p. 2, https://www.heritage.org/budget-and-spending/report/congress-should- stop-abrogating-its-spending-power-and-rein-the-usda. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Section 5 of the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act (Charter Act) \25\ gives the Secretary of Agriculture broad discretionary authority to spend ``unused'' CCC money. However, in general, past Agriculture Secretaries have not used this power to any meaningful extent. This changed dramatically during the Trump Administration, when this discretionary authority was used to fund $28 billion in ``trade aid'' to farmers, consisting primarily of the Market Facilitation Program. In 2020, this authority was used for $20.5 billion in food purchases and income subsidies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\26\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \25\ Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act of 1948, Public Law 80-806. \26\ Bakst and Sewall, ``Congress Should Stop Abrogating Its Spending Power.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- At the time, critics warned that this use of the CCC, which in effect created a USDA slush fund, would lead future Administrations to abuse the CCC, such as by pushing climate-change policies.\27\ Predictably, this is precisely what the Biden Administration has done, using the discretionary authority to create programs out of whole cloth, arguably without statutory authority,\28\ for what it refers to as climate-smart agricultural practices.\29\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \27\ Ibid., p. 3. \28\ Daren Bakst, ``Comment from Bakst, Darren'' on ``Notice: Climate-Smart Agriculture and Forestry Partnership Program, Request for Comments,'' USDA-2021-0010, October 21, 2021, November 1, 2021, https:/ /www.regulations.gov/document/USDA-2021-0010-0001/comment?filter=bakst (accessed December 16, 2022). \29\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, ``Notice: Climate-Smart Agriculture and Forestry Partnership Program.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The merits of the various programs funded through the CCC discretionary authority is not the focus of this discussion. The major problem is that the Secretary of Agriculture is empowered to use a slush fund. Billions of dollars are being used for programs that Congress never envisioned or intended. Concern about this type of abuse is not new. In fact, from 2012 to 2017, Congress expressly limited the Agriculture Secretary's discretionary spending authority under the Charter Act.\30\ And this was before the recent massive discretionary CCC spending occurred. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \30\ Megan Stubbs, ``The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC),'' Congressional Research Service Report for Congress, updated January 14, 2021, https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R44606 (accessed December 16, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The use of the discretionary power is a separation of powers problem, with Congress abrogating its spending power. This power is ripe for abuse--as could be expected with any slush fund--and it is a possible way to get around the farm bill process to achieve policy goals not secured during the legislative process. The next Administration should: Refrain from using section 5 discretionary authority. The USDA can address this abuse on its own by following the lead of most Administrations and not using this discretionary authority. Promote legislative fixes to address abuse. Ideally, Congress would repeal the Secretary's discretionary authority under section 5 of the Charter Act. There is no reason to maintain such authority. If Congress needs to spend money to assist farmers, it has legislative tools, including the farm bill and the annual appropriations process, to do so in a timely fashion. While not an ideal solution, Congress could also amend the Charter Act to require prior Congressional approval through duly enacted legislation before any money is spent. At a minimum, Congress should amend the Charter Act to: Limit spending to directly help farmers and ranchers address issues due to unforeseen events not already covered by existing programs and that constitute genuine emergencies that must be addressed immediately. Prohibit the CCC from being used to assist parties beyond farmers and ranchers. Clarify that spending is only to address problems that are temporary in nature and ensure that funding is targeted to address such problems. Tighten the discretion within section 5 and identify ways for improper application of the Charter Act to be challenged in court. Reform Farm Subsidies. Too often, agricultural policy becomes synonymous with farm subsidy policy. This is unfortunate, because making them synonymous fails to recognize that agricultural policy covers a wide range of issues, including issues that are outside the proper scope of the USDA, such as environmental regulation. However, there is no question that farm subsidies are an important issue within agricultural policy that should be addressed by any incoming Administration. There are several principles that even subsidy supporters would likely agree upon, including the need to reduce market distortions. Subsidies should not influence planting decisions, discourage proper risk management and innovation, incentivize planting on environmentally sensitive land, or create barriers to entry for new farmers. Farm subsidies can lead to these market distortions and therefore, it would hardly be controversial to ensure that any subsidy scheme should be designed to avoid such problems. The overall goal should be to eliminate subsidy dependence. Despite what might be conventional wisdom, many farmers receive few to no subsidies,\31\ with most subsidies going to only a handful of commodities. According to the Congressional Research Service (CRS), from 2014 to 2016, 94 percent of farm program support went to just six commodities--corn, cotton, peanuts, rice, soybeans, and wheat--that together account for only 28 percent of farm receipts.\32\ Although many farmers do not receive much in the way of subsidies, especially those in the areas of livestock and specialty crops (fruit, vegetable, and nuts),\33\ there are still a significant number of farmers growing row crops like corn and cotton that do receive significant farm subsidies. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \31\ ``Overall, 34 percent of all farms reported receiving some type of government payment in 2021,'' and ``verall, 14 percent of U.S. farms participated in Federal crop insurance programs.'' Christine Whitt, Noah Miller, and Ryan Olver, ``America's Farms and Ranches at a Glance: 2022 Edition,'' U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, pp. 24 and 26, https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/ publications/105388/eib-247.pdf?v=527.4 (accessed March 18, 2023). This data, which apparently does not cover crop insurance, included payments beyond just commodity payments, such as conservation payments. \32\ Randy Schnepf, ``Farm Safety-Net Payments Under the 2014 Farm Bill: Comparison by Program Crop,'' Congressional Research Service Report for Congress, August 11, 2017, https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/ R44914.pdf (accessed December 14, 2022). \33\ Although livestock and specialty crop producers do receive some subsidies, former American Farm Bureau Federation President Bob Stallman captured the subsidy issue well. He ``dismisse outright the claim that farmers couldn't survive without subsidy money. `Why does the livestock industry survive without subsidies?' he ask. `Why does the specialty crop  industry survive?'

These programs cover about 20 different crops.\37\ The ARC program protects farmers from what are referred to as ``shallow'' losses, providing payments when their actual revenues fall below 86 percent of the expected revenues for their crops.\38\ The PLC program provides payments to farmers when commodity prices fall below a fixed, statutorily established reference price.\39\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \34\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency, ``ARC/PLC Program,'' https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/ arcplc_program/index (accessed December 16, 2022). \35\ Ibid. \36\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, ``Crop Insurance at a Glance,'' May 31, 2022, https://www.ers.usda.gov/ topics/farm-practices-management/risk-management/crop-insurance-at-a- glance/ (accessed December 16, 2022). \37\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, ``Agriculture Risk Coverage (ALC) & Price Loss Coverage (PLC),'' Farm Service Agency Fact Sheet, August 2019, https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Assets/USDA-FSA-Public/usdafiles/ FactSheets/2019/arc-plc_overview_fact_sheet-aug_2019.pdf (accessed December 16, 2022). \38\ See, for example, U.S Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency, Agriculture Risk Coverage and PriceLoss Coverage Handbook, last amended October 5, 2020, https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSA_File/1- arcplc_r01_a10.pdf (accessed March 18, 2023); Mesbah Motamed, ``Federal Commodity Programs Price Loss Coverage and Agriculture Risk Coverage Address Price Yield Risks Faced by Producers,'' U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, August 6, 2018, https:// www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2018/august/federal-commodity-programs- price-loss-coverage-and-agriculture-risk-coverage-address-price-and- yield-risks-faced-by-producers/ (accessed March 18, 2023); and Taxpayers for Common Sense, ``Shallow Loss Agriculture Programs 101,'' https://www.taxpayer.net/agriculture/shallow-loss-agriculture-programs- 101/ (accessed March 18, 2023). \39\ Ibid. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Federal crop insurance program is broader in scope than ARC and PLC, and in crop year 2019 covered 124 commodities.\40\ Farmers pay a portion of a premium to participate in the program.

This program, unlike most other subsidy programs, intentionally tries to restrict supply \43\ and thereby drives up prices. The program costs consumers as much as $3.7 billion a year.\44\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \43\ ``Farm Bill Primer: Sugar Program,'' Congressional Research Service In Focus, updated May 15, 2018, https://www.everycrsreport.com/ files/2018-05-15_IF10689_42900e56be67f5cfa17e409 53ad9acb54561d3db.pdf (accessed December 16, 2022). \44\ See, for example, Agralytica, ``Economic Effects of the Sugar Program Since the 2008 Farm Bill & Policy Implications for the 2013 Farm Bill,'' June 3, 2013, p. 1, https://fairsugarpolicy.org/wordpress/ wp-content/uploads/2018/03/AgralyticaEconomicEffectsPaper June2013.pdf (accessed December 16, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- When it comes to reforming subsidy programs, the next Administration will primarily have to look to legislative solutions. The next Administration should champion legislation that would: Repeal the Federal sugar program. The Federal Government should not be in the central planning business, and the sugar program is a prime example of harmful central planning. Its very purpose is to limit the sugar supply in order to increase prices. The program has a regressive effect, since lower-income households spend more of their money to meet food needs compared to higher income households.\45\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \45\ U.S. Department of Labor, ``Quintiles of Income Before Taxes,'' and Bakst and Tyrrell, ``Big Government Policies That Hurt the Poor and How to Address Them.'' Ideally, repeal the ARC and PLC programs. Farmers eligible to participate in ARC or PLC are generally already able to purchase Federal crop insurance, policies that protect against shortfalls in expected revenue whether caused by lower prices or smaller harvests. The ARC program is especially egregious because farmers are being protected from shallow losses, which is another way of saying minor dips in expected revenue. This is hardly consistent with the concept of providing a safety net to help farmers when they fall on hard times. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), in one of its options to reduce the Federal deficit, has once again identified repealing all Title I farm programs, including ARC, PLC, and the Federal sugar program.\46\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \46\ Congressional Budget Office, Options for Reducing the Deficit, 2023 to 2032, p. 3. See also Congressional Budget Office, ``Reduce Subsidies in the Crop Insurance Program,'' in Congressional Budget Office, ``Options for Reducing the Deficit: 2021 to 2030,'' December 9, 2020, https://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/56815 (accessed December 14, 2022). Stop paying farmers twice for price and revenue losses during the same year. Farmers can receive support from the ARC or PLC programs and the Federal crop insurance program to cover price declines and revenue shortfalls during the same year. Congress should prohibit this duplication by prohibiting farmers from receiving an ARC or PLC payment the same year they --------------------------------------------------------------------------- receive a crop insurance indemnity. Reduce the premium subsidy rate for crop insurance. On average, taxpayers cover about 60 percent \47\ of the premium cost for policies purchased in the Federal crop insurance program. One of the most widely supported and bipartisan policy reforms is to reduce the premium subsidy that taxpayers are forced to pay.\48\ At a minimum, taxpayers should not pay more than 50 percent of the premium. After all, taxpayers should not have to pay more than the farmers who benefit from the crop insurance policies. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \47\ Congressional Budget Office, Options for Reducing the Deficit, 2023 to 2032, p. 6. \48\ ``Reduce Premium Subsidies in the Federal Crop Insurance Program,'' Budget Blueprint for Fiscal Year 2023, https:// www.heritage.org/budget/pages/recommendations/2.350.171.html. CBO has found that reducing the premium subsidy to 47 percent would save $8.1 billion over 10 years and have little impact on crop insurance participation or on the number of covered acres.\49\ In that analysis, there would be a reduction in insured acres of just \1/2\ of 1 percent, and only 1.5 percent of acres would have lower coverage levels.\50\ This reform is basically all benefit with little to no cost. In its recently released report identifying options to reduce the Federal deficit, CBO found that reducing the premium subsidy to 40 percent would save $20.9 billion over 10 years.\51\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \49\ Congressional Budget Office, ``Reduce Subsidies in the Crop Insurance Program.'' \50\ Ibid. \51\ Congressional Budget Office, Options for Reducing the Deficit, 2023 to 2032, p. 6. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Beyond these legislative reforms, the next Administration should: Communicate to Congress the necessity of transparency and a genuine reform process. The White House and the USDA should make it very clear that the farm bill process, including reform of farm subsidies, must be conducted through an open process with time for mark-up and the opportunity for changes to be made outside the Agriculture Committee process. The farm bill too often is developed behind closed doors and without any chance for real reform. The White House, given the power of the bully pulpit, must demand a genuine reform process and express unwavering support for a USDA that shapes a safety net that considers the interests of farmers, while also remembering the interests of taxpayers and consumers. Any safety net for farmers should be a true safety net--one that helps farmers when they have experienced serious unforeseen losses (preferably when there has been a disaster or unforeseen natural event causing damage) and that exists to help them in unusual situations. Separate the agricultural provisions of the farm bill from the nutrition provisions. To have genuine reform and proper consideration of the issues, agricultural programs should be considered in separate legislation distinct from food stamps and the nutrition part of the farm bill, and reauthorization of such programs should be fixed on different timelines to ensure this separation. Agricultural and nutritional programs, which are distinct from each other, have been combined together for political reasons, something which is readily admitted by proponents of this logrolling. When it comes to American agriculture and welfare programs, they deserve sound policy debates, not political tactics at the expense of thoughtful discourse. Move the Work of the Food and Nutrition Service. The USDA implements many means-tested Federal support programs, including the largest food assistance program, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, also known as food stamps), and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Food Program. The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) oversees these programs and other food and nutrition programs, including the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion,\52\ which handles the USDA's work on the ``Dietary Guidelines for Americans'' (Dietary Guidelines).\53\ Food nutrition programs include: SNAP; WIC; the National School Lunch Program (NSLP); the School Breakfast Program (SBP); the Child and Adult Care Food Program; the Nutrition Program for the Elderly; Nutrition Service Incentives; the Summer Food Service Program; the Commodity Supplemental Food Program; the Temporary Emergency Food Program; the Farmers Market Nutrition Program; and the Special Milk Program. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \52\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service, ``Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP),'' https:// www.fns.usda.gov/cnpp (accessed December 16, 2022), and U.S. Department of Agriculture, ``About CNPP,'' Food and Nutrition Service, https:// www.fns.usda.gov/about-cnpp (accessed December 16, 2022). \53\ Dietary Guidelines for Americans, ``Purpose of the Dietary Guidelines,'' https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/about-dietary- guidelines/purpose-dietary-guidelines (accessed December 16, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The next Administration should: Move the USDA food and nutrition programs to the Department of Health and Human Services. There are more than 89 current means-tested welfare programs, and total means-tested spending has been estimated to surpass $1.2 trillion between Federal and state resources.\54\ Because means-tested Federal programs are siloed and administered in separate agencies, the effectiveness and size of the welfare state remains largely hidden. There are means-tested food-support programs in the USDA (specially FNS), whereas most means-tested programs are at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). All means-tested antipoverty programs should be overseen by one department--specifically HHS, which handles most welfare programs. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \54\ Robert Rector and Vijay Menon, ``Understanding the Hidden $1.1 Trillion Welfare System and How to Reform It,'' Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 3294, April 5, 2018, https://www.heritage.org/welfare/ report/understanding-the-hidden-11-trillion-welfare-system-and-how- reform-it. Reform SNAP. Ostensibly, SNAP sends money through electronic- benefit-transfer (EBT) cards to help ``low-income'' individuals buy food. It is the largest of the Federal nutrition programs. Food stamps are designed to be supplemented by other forms of income--whether through paid employment or nonprofit support. SNAP serves 41.1 million individuals--an increase of 4.3 million people during the Biden years.\55\ In 2020, the food stamp program cost $79.1 billion. That number continued to rise--by 2022, outlays hit $119.5 billion.\56\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \55\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, ``SNAP Data Tables,'' Food and Nutrition Service, December 9, 2022, https://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/ supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap (accessed December 16, 2022). \56\ Ibid. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The next Administration should: Re-implement work requirements. The statutory language covering food stamps allows states to waive work requirements that otherwise apply to work-capable individuals--that is, adult beneficiaries between the ages 18 and 50 who are not disabled and do not have any children or other dependents in the home.\57\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \57\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service, ``SNAP Work Requirements,'' May 2019, https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/ work-requirements (accessed December 16, 2022). Even in a strong economy, work expectations are fairly limited: Individuals who are work-capable and without dependents are required to work or prepare for work for 20 hours per week.\58\ The work requirements are then implemented unless the state requests a waiver from the USDA's Food and Nutrition Services.\59\ Waivers from statutory work requirements can be approved in two instances: an unemployment rate of more than ten percent or a lack of sufficient jobs.\60\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \58\ 7 U.S. Code  2015, https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/ 2015 (accessed December 16, 2022). \59\ Ibid. \60\ 7 U.S. Code  2015(o)(4). The USDA has approved nearly all waivers under the ``lack of sufficient jobs'' option. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Trump Administration bolstered USDA work expectations in the food stamp program. In February 2019, FNS issued a modest regulatory change that applied only to able-bodied individuals without dependents--beneficiaries aged 18 to 49, not elderly or disabled, who did not have children or other dependents in the home (ABAWD).\61\ The FNS rule changed when a state could receive a waiver from implementing the ABAWD work requirement. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \61\ Federal Register, Vol. 84, No. 234 (December 5, 2019) p. 66782, https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2019-12-05/pdf/2019- 26044.pdf (accessed December 14, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Under the new rule, in order to waive the work requirement, the state's unemployment rate had to be above six percent for more than 24 months. The rule also defined ``area'' in such a way that states would be unable to combine non-contiguous counties in order to maximize their waivers.\62\ Of the more than 40 million food stamp beneficiaries, the Trump rule would have applied only to 688,000 individuals in Fiscal Year 2021.\63\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \62\ Ibid., p. 66795. \63\ Ibid., pp. 66807-66810. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Trump reform was scheduled to go into effect, but a D.C. district court Federal judge enjoined the rule.\64\ The USDA filed an appeal in late December 2020,\65\ but the Biden Administration withdrew from defending the challenge, and the rule was never implemented.\66\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \64\ District of Columbia, et al. v.

This requirement is an option states can apply to workcapable beneficiaries aged 16 to 59. If beneficiaries' work hours are below 30 hours a week, states can implement the general work requirements to oblige beneficiaries to register for work or participate in SNAP Employment and Training or workfare assigned by the state SNAP agency.\67\ Increased clarity for states would include items like states being required to offer employment and training spots for those that request them--not simply budgeting for every currently enrolled able-bodied adult. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \67\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, ``SNAP Employment and Training Screening and Referral Guidance,'' July 13, 2022, https:// www.fns.usda.gov/snap/et-screening-and-referral-guidance (accessed December 16, 2022). Reform broad-based categorical eligibility. Federal law permits states to enroll individuals in food stamps if they receive a benefit from another program, such as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. However, under an administrative option in TANF called broad-based categorical eligibility (BBCE), ``benefit'' is defined so broadly that it includes simply receiving distributed pamphlets and 1-800 numbers.\68\ This definition, with its low threshold to trigger a ``benefit,'' allows individuals to bypass eligibility limits--particularly the asset requirement (how much the applicant has in resources, such as bank accounts or property).\69\ Adopting the BBCE option has even allowed millionaires to enroll in the food stamp program.\70\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \68\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service, ``Regulatory Reform at a Glance: Proposed Rule; Revision of SNAP Categorical Eligibility,'' July 2019, https://www.usda.gov/sites/ default/files/documents/BBCE_Fact_Sheet_%28FINAL%29_72219-PR.pdf (accessed December 14, 2022). \69\ 7 Code of Federal Regulations  273.8 (1978), https:// www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/7/273.8 (accessed December 16, 2022). \70\ Kristina Rasmussen, ``How Millionaires Collect Food Stamps,'' Wall Street Journal, January 15, 2018, https://www.wsj.com/articles/ how-millionaires-collect-food-stamps-1516044026 (accessed December 14, 2022). The Trump Administration proposed to close the loophole with a rule to ``increase program integrity and reduce fraud, waste, and abuse.'' \71\ The regulation was not finalized before the end of the Trump Administration. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \71\ Federal Register, Vol. 84, No. 142 (July 24, 2019), pp. 35570- 55581, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/07/24/2019-15670/ revision-of-categorical-eligibility-in-the-supplemental-nutrition- assistance-program-snap (accessed December 14, 2022). Re-evaluate the Thrifty Food Plan. In a dramatic overreach, the Biden Administration unilaterally increased food stamp benefits by at least 23 percent in October 2021.\72\ Through an update to the Thrifty Food Plan, in which the USDA analyzes a basket of foods intended to provide a nutritious diet, the USDA increased food stamp outlays by between $250 billion and $300 billion over 10 years.\73\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \72\ News release, ``USDA Modernizes the Thrifty Food Plan, Updates SNAP Benefits,'' U.S. Department of Agriculture, August 16, 2021, https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2021/08/16/usda-modernizes- thrifty-food-plan-updates-snap- (accessed December 14, 2022). \73\ Phillip L.

Although the 2018 farm bill instructed FNS to update the Thrifty Food Plan by 2023 and every 5 years thereafter, every previous Thrifty Food Plan has been always cost-neutral (just an inflation update)--exactly what CBO estimated as cost of the 2018 farm bill.\74\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \74\ Congressional Budget Office, ``H.R. 2, as Passed by the House of Representatives and as Passed by the Senate,'' July 24, 2018, https://www.cbo.gov/publication/54284 (accessed December 16, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Biden Administration may have skirted regulations and Congressional authority to increase the overall cost of the program. In fact, Senate and House Republicans requested that the Government Accountability Office investigate the legal authorities and process that the USDA undertook to arrive at such an unprecedented increase.\75\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \75\ News release, ``Republican AG Committee Leadership Urge GAO Review of USDA Thrifty Food Plan Scheme,'' U.S. House Committee on Agriculture, August 13, 2021, https://republicans- agriculture.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=7013 (accessed December 14, 2022). Eliminate the heat-and-eat loophole. States can artificially boost a household's food stamp benefit by using the heat-and- eat loophole. The amount of food stamps a household receives is based on its ``countable'' income (income minus certain deductions). Households that receive benefits from the Low- Income Heat and Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) are eligible for a larger utility deduction. In order to make households eligible for the higher deduction, and thus for greater food stamp benefits, states have distributed LIHEAP checks for --------------------------------------------------------------------------- amounts as small as $1 to food stamp recipients. The 2014 Farm Bill tightened this loophole by requiring that a household must receive more than $20 annually in LIHEAP payments to be eligible for the larger utility deduction and subsequently higher food stamp benefits.\76\ Nonetheless, states continue to inflate their standard utility allowances. Under the Trump Administration, the USDA proposed a rule, which was not finalized, that would have standardized the utility allowance.\77\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \76\ ``The 2014 Farm Bill: Changing the Tradition of LIHEAP Receipt in the Calculation of SNAP Benefits,'' updated February 12, 2014, Congressional Research Service Report for Congress R42591, https:// crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R42591/24 (accessed March 18, 2023). \77\ Federal Register, Vol. 84, No. 192 (October 3, 2019), pp. 52809-52815, https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2019-10-03/pdf/ 2019-21287.pdf (accessed December 16, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reform WIC. Turning to WIC, this program distributes money through EBT cards to help low-income women, infants, and children under 6 purchase nutrition-rich foods and nutrition education (including breastfeeding support). As of August 2022, approximately 6.3 million people participated in WIC each month to purchase food.\78\ In 2021, WIC Federal outlays were $5 billion.\79\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \78\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, ``Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Data Series, 2018 to 2022,'' https://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/wic-program (accessed December 14, 2022). \79\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service, ``WIC Data Tables,'' December 9, 2022, https://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/wic- program (accessed December 16, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The next Administration should: Reform the state voucher system. State agencies control WIC costs by approving only one brand of infant formula through competitive bidding for infant formula rebate contracts. Because 50 percent of baby formula is purchased through the Federal WIC program, it is vital that regulation for these competitive bidding contracts does not unintentionally create monopolies. Re-evaluate excessive regulation. As for baby formula regulations generally, labeling regulations and regulations that unnecessarily delay the manufacture and sale of baby formula should be re-evaluated.\80\ During the Biden Administration, there have been devastating baby formula shortages. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \80\ U.S. Food and Drug Administration, ``Regulations and Information on the Manufacture and Distribution of Infant Formula,'' May 16, 2022, https://www.fda.gov/food/infant-formula-guidance- documents-regulatory-information/regulations-and-information- manufacture-and-distribution-infant-formula (accessed December 14, 2022). Return to the Original Purpose of School Meals. Federal meal programs for K-12 students were created to provide food to children from low-income families while at school.\81\ Today, however, Federal school meals increasingly resemble entitlement programs that have strayed far from their original objective and represent an example of the ever-expanding Federal footprint in local school operations. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \81\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service, ``History of the National School Lunch Program,'' January 17, 2008, https://www.fns.usda.gov/nslp/program-history (accessed December 14, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The NSLP and SBP are the two largest K-12 meal programs provided by Federal taxpayer money.

However, the USDA has taken it even further, improperly interpreting the law \85\ to allow a subset of schools within a district to be grouped together to reach the 40 percent threshold, As a result, a school with zero low-income students could be grouped together with schools with high levels of low-income students, and as a result all the students in the schools within that group (even schools without a single low-income student) can receive free Federal meals.\86\ Schools can direct resources meant for students in poverty to children from wealthier families. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \85\ Daren Bakst and Jonathan Butcher, ``A Critical Fix to the Federal Overreach on School Meals,'' Heritage Foundation Issue Brief No. 4976, July 11, 2019, https://www.heritage.org/hunger-and-food- programs/report/critical-fix-the-federal-overreach-school-meals. \86\ Ibid., and U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service, ``Community Eligibility Provision,'' April 19, 2019, https:// www.fns.usda.gov/cn/community-eligibility-provision (accessed December 16, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Furthermore, the NSLP and SBP are among the most inaccurate Federal programs according to PaymentAccuracy.gov, a project of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget and the Office of the Inspector General.\87\ Before Federal auditors reduced the rigor of annual reporting requirements in 2018, the NSLP had wasted nearly $2 billion in taxpayer resources through payments provided to ineligible recipients.\88\ Even after the auditing changes, which the U.S. Government Accountability Office said results in the USDA not ``regularly assess the programs' fraud risks,'' the NSLP wasted nearly $500 million in FY 2021.\89\ The SBP now wastes nearly $200 million annually.\90\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \87\ See Payment Accuracy, https://www.paymentaccuracy.gov/ (accessed December 16, 2022). \88\ Payment Accuracy, ``Payment Integrity Scorecard,'' https:// www.cfo.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/Q3/ FNS%20National%20School%20Lunch%20Program%20(NSLP)%20Payments %20Integrity%20Scorecard%20FY%202022%20Q3.pdf (accessed December 14, 2022). \89\ U.S. Government Accountability Office, ``School Meals Programs: USDA Has Reported Taking Some Steps to Reduce Improper Payments But Should Comprehensively Assess Fraud Risks,'' GAO-19-389, May 21, 2022, https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-19-389 (accessed December 14, 2022). \90\ Payment Accuracy, ``Payment Integrity Scorecard.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Despite the ongoing effort to expand school meals under CEP and the evidence of waste and inefficiency, left-of-center Members of Congress and President Biden's Administration have nonetheless proposed further expansions to extend Federal school meals to include every K-12 student--regardless of need.\91\ The Administration recently proposed expanding Federal school meal programs offered during the school year to be offered during the summer as part of the ``American Families Plan,'' and also proposed expanding CEP. Other Federal officials, including Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), have, in recent years, proposed expanding the NSLP to all students.\92\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \91\ White House, ``Fact Sheet: The American Families Plan,'' April 28, 2021, https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/ 2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/ (accessed December 14, 2022). \92\ Universal School Meals Program Act of 2021, S. 1530, 117th Cong., 1st Sess., https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate- bill/1530 (accessed December 14, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- To serve students in need and prevent the misuse of taxpayer money, the next Administration should focus on students in need and reject efforts to transform Federal school meals into an entitlement program. Specifically, the next Administration should: Promulgate a rule properly interpreting CEP. The USDA should issue a rule that clarifies that only an individual school or a school district as a whole, not a subset of schools within a district, must meet the 40 percent criteria to be eligible for CEP. Education officials should be prohibited from grouping schools together. Work with lawmakers to eliminate CEP. The NSLP and SBP should be directed to serve children in need, not become an entitlement for students from middle- and upper-income homes. Congress should eliminate CEP. Further, the USDA should not provide meals to students during the summer unless students are taking summer-school classes. Currently, students can get meals from schools even if they are not in summer school, which has, in effect, turned school meals into a Federal catering program.\93\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \93\ See, for example, U.S. Department of Agriculture, ``Find Meals for Kids When Schools Are Closed,'' Food and Nutrition Service, September 22, 2022, https://www.fns.usda.gov/meals4kids (accessed December 16, 2022), and U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service, ``Seamless Summer and Other Options for School,'' July 16, 2013, https://www.fns.usda.gov/sfsp/seamless-summer-and-other- options-schools (accessed December 16, 2022). Restore programs to their original intent and reject efforts to create universal free school meals. The USDA should work with lawmakers to restore NSLP and SBP to their original goal of providing food to K-12 students who otherwise would not have --------------------------------------------------------------------------- food to eat while at school. Federal school meals should be focused on children in need, and any efforts to expand student eligibility for Federal school meals to include all K-12 students should be soundly rejected. Such expansion would allow an inefficient, wasteful program to grow, magnifying the amount of wasted taxpayer resources. Reform Conservation Programs. Farmers, in general, are excellent stewards of the land, if not for moral or ethical considerations, then out of self-interest to make sure their land and--by extension, their livelihoods--remain intact. Farmers are often called the original conservationists.\94\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \94\ Tom Driscoll, ``From the Field: Farmers Are the Original Conservationists,'' National Farmers Union, August 30, 2017, https:// nfu.org/2017/08/30/from-the-field-farmers-are-the-original- conservationists/ (accessed December 16, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- When evaluating Federal conservation programs, it is important to remember the importance of the land to farmers. In terms of USDA Federal conservation programs, both the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) and Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) oversee numerous programs.\95\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \95\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency, ``Conservation Programs,'' https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and- services/conservation-programs/index (accessed December 16, 2022), and U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, ``Programs and Initiatives,'' https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/programs- initiatives (accessed December 16, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As a general matter, the next Administration should ensure that these programs address genuine and specific environmental concerns with a focus on currently existing environmental problems, not those that are speculative in nature. These conservation programs should have clearly identifiable goals, with the success or failure of these programs being directly measurable. Any assistance to farmers to take specific actions should not be provided unless the assistance will directly and clearly help to address a specific environmental problem. Further, any assistance to encourage farmers to engage in certain practices should only be provided if farmers would not have adopted the practices in the first place. There are specific issues that the next Administration should address. The Conservation Reserve Program,\96\ which is run by FSA, pays farmers to not farm some of their land. This program has recently received attention, as agricultural groups rightfully seek to farm without penalty voluntarily idled land, in light of the consequences to food prices of Russia invading Ukraine.\97\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \96\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency, ``Conservation Reserve Program: About the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP),'' https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/conservation- programs/conservation-reserve-program/ (accessed December 16, 2022). \97\ American Bakers Association, et al., letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, March 23, 2022, https:// www.dropbox.com/s/yfyv04ilkom11zd/USDA%20Letter%20to %20Secretary%20Vilsack%20on%20Tools%20to%20Address%20Global%20Commodity% 20Supply %20Challenges%203.23.22_.pdf?dl=0 (accessed December 15, 2022). It is also necessary to increase food production to mitigate high food inflation. Approximately 25 percent of idled land is considered prime farmland. Therefore, \1/4\ of idled land is merely idling, not producing food--and this does not include other land that may viably be used for food production. The Conservation Reserve Program should be eliminated. There are also two issues connected to property rights and fairness that should be addressed: challenging NRCS determinations and problems with USDA easements. To be eligible for many USDA programs, farmers must comply with certain conservation provisions enforced by NRCS. Conservation compliance of wetlands and highly erodible lands consist of Federal restrictions that prevent farmers from using parts of their property. If farmers plant crops or modify the areas Federal officials deem protected, farmers can lose all access to USDA programs and support. For farmers, there are real, practical concerns to challenging NRCS determinations, including the time and costs of challenging the Federal bureaucracy. NRCS is empowered to declare areas wetlands and highly erodible areas, which are therefore off limits for farming. If these wetland- or erodible-declared areas are used in a manner deemed unacceptable by Federal officials, NRCS may revoke access to Federal resources and subsidies by making technical determinations that carry potential penalties. There must be a fair and reasonable process for farmers to challenge such actions. See Daren Bakst, ``Food Price Inflation Continues to Worsen. Here's What Should Be Done About It,'' The Daily Signal, April 25, 2022, https://www.dailysignal.com/ 2022/04/25/food-price-inflation-continuing-to-worsen-heres-what-should- be-done-about-it/ (accessed December 15, 2022); American Bakers Association et.al., letter to Vilsack; U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, ``Conservation Compliance Appeals Process,'' https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/getting-assistance/ compliance/conservation-compliance-appeals-process (accessed December 15, 2022); and Chris Bennett, ``Regulatory Hell: Farmer and Veteran Wins 10-Year Wetlands Fight With Government,'' AG Web, August 30, 2021, https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/regulatory-hell- farmer-and-veteran-wins-10-year-wetlands-fight (accessed December 15, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- There is also a need to reform USDA's conservation easements. These easements are a powerful tool to incentivize long-term preservation of ecosystems while still allowing farmers to benefit economically. However, when farmers and ranchers sign conservation easements with the USDA, they can be enforced in perpetuity. Future generations, be they the descendants of the landowner or new residents, are bound by those conditions. Ecosystems and topography naturally change over time, but without legislative change, easement requirements will not. The next Administration should: Champion the elimination of the Conservation Reserve Program. Farmers should not be paid in such a sweeping way not to farm their land. If there is a desire to ensure that extremely sensitive land is not farmed, this should be addressed through targeted efforts that are clearly connected to addressing a specific and concrete environmental harm. The USDA should work with Congress to eliminate this overbroad program. Reform NRCS wetlands and erodible land compliance and appeals. Problematic NRCS overreach could be avoided entirely by removing its authority to prescribe specific practices on a particular farm operation in order to ensure continued eligibility to participate in USDA farm programs, and to require instead that each farm (as a function of eligibility) must have created a general best practices plan. Such a plan could be approved by the local county Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD). The local SWCD commissioners are elected by their peers in each respective county and are better suited than the NRCS to provide guidance for farm operations in their respective jurisdictions. At a minimum, a new Administration should support legislation to divest more power to the states (and possibly local SWCDs) regarding erodible land and wetlands conservation.\98\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \98\ Fortunately, there are already resources available to help states establish their own wetlands conservation programs. One particular example, the American Legislative Exchange Council's Wetlands Mapping and Protection Act model policy, is available for states to define the procedures, guidelines, and administration of wetlands programs. American Legislative Exchange Council, ``Wetlands Mapping and Protection Act,'' November 16, 2017, https://alec.org/ model-policy/wetlands-mapping-and-protection-act/ (accessed December 16, 2022). The new Administration should focus on best practices instead of imposing prescriptive Federal practices. It should support the policies contained within the ``NRCS Wetland Compliance and Appeals Reform Act'' and modify NRCS compliance rules to protect farmers and ranchers by adding protections against regulatory overreach--such as banning the practice of re-engaging farmers in new technical determinations appeals processes for the same areas of their farms. See NRCS Wetland Compliance and Appeals Reform Act, S. 4931, 117th Cong., 2nd Sess., https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/ 4931?s=1&r=8 (accessed December 15, 2022). Reform easements. The new Administration should, to the extent authorized by law, limit the use of permanent easements and collaborate with lawmakers to prohibit the USDA from creating new permanent easements.\99\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \99\ Ibid. Other Major Issues and Specific Recommendations. Although the following issues have not been listed as ``priority,'' these issues are still extremely important, and the next Administration should address them. Only meat and poultry from federally inspected facilities can be sold in interstate commerce.\100\ Even meat and poultry from USDA- approved state-inspected facilities may only be sold in intrastate commerce, with limited exceptions.\101\ This is despite the fact that states with USDA-approved inspection programs must meet and enforce requirements that are ``at least equal to'' those imposed under the Federal Meat and Poultry Products Inspection Acts and the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act of 1978.\102\ This is an unnecessary regulatory barrier that makes it difficult to get meat and poultry into interstate commerce to create more options for consumers and farmers. Legislation entitled the New Markets for State-Inspected Meat and Poultry Act of 2021 would help to remove this obstacle.\103\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \100\ See, for example, Daren Bakst and Jeremy Dalrymple, ``Reducing Federal Barriers for the Sale of Meat,'' Heritage Foundation Issue Brief No. 5078, June 1, 2020, https://www.heritage.org/ agriculture/report/reducing-federal-barriers-the-sale-meat, and U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service, ``State Inspection Programs,'' updated January 12, 2023, https:// www.fsis.usda.gov/inspection/state-inspection-programs (accessed December 15, 2022). \101\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service, ``Cooperative Interstate Shipping Program,'' September 7, 2022, https://www.fsis.usda.gov/inspection/state-inspection-programs/ cooperative-interstate-shipping-program (accessed December 15, 2022). \102\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, ``State Inspection Programs.'' \103\ The Senate bill removes obstacles for both meat and poultry. The House version does not appear to cover poultry. New Markets for State-Inspected Meat and Poultry Act of 2021, S. 107, 117th Cong., 1st Sess., https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/107 (accessed December 15, 2022), and Expanding Markets for State-Inspected Meat Processors Act of 2021, H.R. 1998, 117th Cong., 1st Sess., https:/ /www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1998 (accessed December 15, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The next Administration should: Promote legislation that would allow state-inspected meat to be sold in interstate commerce. These barriers to the sale of meat and poultry from USDA-approved state-inspected facilities should be removed. Eliminate or Reform Marketing Orders and Checkoff Programs. Marketing orders and checkoff programs for agricultural commodities are similar in many ways. They both allow private actors within an industry to collaborate with the Federal Government to compel other competitors within an industry to fund the respective marketing order or checkoff program. There are currently 22 checkoff programs,\104\ and they focus on research and promotion of commodities such as beef and eggs. Marketing orders cover research and promotion, but also cover issues such as quality regulations and volume controls. The latter issue, volume controls, is a means to restrict supply, which drives up prices for consumers. Fortunately, there are few active volume controls.\105\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \104\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Marketing Service, ``Specialty Crops Marketing Orders & Agreements,'' https:// www.ams.usda.gov/rules-regulations/moa/fv (accessed December 15, 2022). \105\ See, for example, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Marketing Service, ``Commodities Covered by Marketing Orders,'' https://www.ams.usda.gov/rules-regulations/moa/commodities (accessed March 18, 2023), and Elayne Allen and Darren Bakst, ``How the Government Is Mandating Food Waste,'' August 19, 2016, https:// www.dailysignal.com/2016/08/19/how-the-government-is-mandating-food- waste/ (accessed March 18, 2023). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marketing orders and checkoff programs are some of the most egregious programs run by the USDA. They are, in effect, a tax--a means to compel speech--and government-blessed cartels. Instead of getting private cooperation, they are tools for industry actors to work with government to force cooperation. The next Administration should: Reduce the number and scope of marketing orders and checkoff programs. The USDA should reject any new requests for marketing orders and checkoff programs to the extent authorized by law and eliminate existing programs when possible. While the programs work differently, there are often petition processes and other ways that make it difficult for affected parties to get rid of the marketing orders and checkoff programs,\106\ and the USDA itself may not even be required to honor requests to terminate a program.\107\ The USDA should make the process easier. Further, the USDA should reject any effort to bring back volume controls to limit supplies of commodities. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \106\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Marketing Service, ``Frequently Asked Questions Regarding the Beef Checkoff Program Petition Process,'' https://www.ams.usda.gov/rules-regulations/ research-promotion/beef/petition (accessed December 16, 2022); ``Beef Producers: Do You Want to Vote on the Checkoff?''

As reported, ``There has not been a referendum of the mandatory National Beef Checkoff Program in 35 years.'' \107\ See, for example, Federal Register, Vol. 86, No. 213 (November 8, 2021), p. 61718, https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR- 2021-11-08/pdf/2021-24301.pdf (accessed December 16, 2022). Work with Congress to eliminate marketing orders and checkoff programs. These programs should be eliminated, and if industry actors want to collaborate, they should do so through --------------------------------------------------------------------------- private means, not using the government to compel cooperation. Promote legislation that would require regular votes. There should be regular voting for parties subject to checkoff programs and marketing orders. For example, the voting should occur at least every 5 years, to determine whether a marketing order or checkoff program should continue. The USDA should be required to honor the results of such a vote. Through regular voting, parties can demonstrate their support for a marketing order or checkoff program and ensure that those administering them will be held accountable. Focus on Trade Policy, Not Trade Promotion. The USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) covers numerous issues, including ``trade policy,'' which is a reference to removing trade barriers, among other things, to ensure an environment conducive to trade.\108\ It also covers trade promotion.\109\ This includes programs like the Market Access Program \110\ that subsidizes trade associations, businesses, and other private entities to market and promote their products overseas. FAS should play a proactive and leading role to help open upmarkets for American farmers and ranchers. There are numerous barriers, such as sanitary and phytosanitary measures, blocking American agricultural products from gaining access to foreign markets.\111\ However, FAS should not help businesses and industries promote their exports, something these businesses and industries can and should do on their own. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \108\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, Foreign Agricultural Service, ``Topics,'' https://www.fas.usda.gov/topics (accessed December 15, 2022). \109\ Ibid. \110\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, Foreign Agricultural Service, ``Market Access Program (MAP),'' https://www.fas.usda.gov/programs/ market-access-program-map (accessed December 16, 2022). \111\ To learn about trade barriers for food and agricultural products, see, for example, News release, ``USTR Releases 2022 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers,'' Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, March 31, 2022, https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy- offices/press-office/press-releases/2022/march/ustr-releases-2022- national-trade-estimate-report-foreign-trade-barriers (accessed December 16, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The next Administration should: Push legislation to repeal export promotion programs. The USDA should work with Congress to repeal market development programs like the Market Access Program and similar programs. Remove Obstacles for Agricultural Biotechnology. Innovation is critical to agricultural production and the ability to meet future food needs. The next Administration should embrace innovation and technology, not hinder its use--especially because of scare tactics that ignore sound science. One of the key innovations in agriculture is genetic engineering. According to the USDA, ``urrently, over 90 percent of U.S. corn, upland cotton, and soybeans are produced using GE  varieties.'' \112\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \112\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, ``Recent Trends in GE Adoption,'' September 14, 2022, https:// www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/adoption-of-genetically-engineered- crops-in-the-u-s/recent-trends-in-ge-adoption/ (accessed December 15, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Despite the importance of agricultural biotechnology, in 2016, Congress passed a Federal mandate to label genetically engineered food.\113\ This legislation was arguably just a means to try to provide a negative connotation to GE food. There are other challenges as well for agricultural biotechnology. For example, Mexico plans to ban the importation of U.S. genetically modified yellow corn.\114\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \113\ National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard, Public Law 114-216. \114\ Noi Mahoney, ``Trade Dispute Arising Over Mexico's Plan to Block Imports of Genetically Modified Corn,'' Freight Waves, November 22, 2022, https://www.freightwaves.com/news/trade-dispute-arising-over- mexicos-plan-to-block-imports-of-gm-corn (accessed December 15, 2022), and News release, ``Grassley, Ernst, Urge USTR to Intervene In Mexico's Ban on American Corn,'' Office of Chuck Grassley, November 14, 2022, https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/grassley-ernst-urge- ustr-to-intervene-in-mexicos-banon-american-corn (accessed December 15, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The next Administration should: Counter scare tactics and remove obstacles. The USDA should strongly counter scare tactics regarding agricultural biotechnology and adopt policies to remove unnecessary barriers to approvals and the adoption of biotechnology. Repeal the Federal labeling mandate. The USDA should work with Congress to repeal the Federal labeling law, while maintaining Federal preemption, and stress that voluntary labeling is allowed. Use all tools available to remove improper trade barriers against agricultural biotechnology. The USDA should work closely with the Office of the United States Trade Representative to remove improper barriers imposed by other countries to block U.S. agricultural goods. Reform Forest Service Wildfire Management. The United States Forest Service is one of four Federal Government land management agencies that administer 606 million acres, or 95 percent of the 640 million acres of surface land area managed by the Federal Government.\115\ Located within the USDA, the Forest Service manages the National Forest System, which is comprised of 193 million acres.\116\ As explained by the USDA, ``The USDA Forest Service's mission is to sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of the nation's forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations.'' \117\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \115\ ``The Federal Land Management Agencies,'' Congressional Research Service In Focus, updated February 16, 2021, https:// sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/IF10585.pdf (accessed December 16, 2022). \116\ Ibid. \117\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, Fiscal Year 2023: Budget Justification, March 2022, p. 1, https:// www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/30a-2023-FS.pdf (accessed December 16, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Forest Service should focus on proactive management of the forests and grasslands that does not depend heavily on burning. There should be resilient forests and grasslands in the wake of management actions. Wildfires have become a primary vegetation management regime for national forests and grasslands.\118\ Recognizing the need for vegetation management, the Forest Service has adopted ``pyro- silviculture'' using ``unplanned'' fire,\119\ such as unplanned human- caused fires, to otherwise accomplish vegetation management.\120\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \118\ Forests and Rangelands, The National Strategy: The Final Phase in the Development of the National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy, April 2014, https://www.forestsandrangelands.gov/ documents/strategy/strategy/CSPhaseIIINationalStrategyApr 2014.pdf (accessed December 16, 2022). \119\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, ``Unplanned Fires,'' https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/inyo/ landmanagement/resourcemanagement/?cid=stelprd3804071 (accessed December 16, 2022). \120\ See, for example, Sherry Devlin, ``A Conversation with Jim Hubbard: Unplanned Wildfires Rule West's Forests,'' TreeSource, March 28, 2017, https://treesource.org/news/lands/jim-hubbard-forest-service- wildfires/ (accessed December 16, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Forest Service should instead be focusing on addressing the precipitous annual amassing of biomass in the national forests that drive the behavior of wildfires. By thinning trees, removing live fuels and deadwood, and taking other preventive steps, the Forest Service can help to minimize the consequencesof wildfires. Increasing timber sales could also play an important role in the effort to change the behavior of wildfire because there would be less biomass. Timber sales and timber harvested in public forests dropped precipitously in the early 1990s and still remain very low. For example, in 1988, the volume of timber sold and harvested by volume was about 11 billion and 12.6 billion board feet (BBF), respectively.\121\ In 2021, timber sold was 2.8 BBF and timber harvested was 2.4 BBF. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \121\ U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, ``FY 1905-2021 National Summary Cut and Sold Data Graphs,'' https:// www.fs.usda.gov/forestmanagement/documents/sold-harvest/documents/1905- 2021_Natl_Summary_Graph_wHarvestAcres.pdf (accessed December 16, 2022), and U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, ``Forest Products Cut and Sold from the National Forests and Grasslands,'' https://www.fs.usda.gov/forestmanagement/products/cut-sold/index.shtml (accessed December 16, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In 2018, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 13855 to, among other things, promote active management of forests and reduce wildfire risks.\122\ The executive order stated, ``Active management of vegetation is needed to treat these dangerous conditions on Federal lands but is often delayed due to challenges associated with regulatory analysis and current consultation requirements.'' \123\ It further explained the need to reduce regulatory obstacles to fuel reduction in forests created by the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act.\124\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \122\ Donald J.

Eliminate or Reform the Dietary Guidelines. The USDA, in collaboration with HHS, publishes the Dietary Guidelines every 5 years.\125\ For more than 40 years, the Federal Government has been releasing Dietary Guidelines,\126\ and during this time, there has been constant controversy due to questionable recommendations and claims regarding the politicization of the process. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \125\ Dietary Guidelines for Americans, https:// www.dietaryguidelines.gov/ (accessed December 16, 2022). \126\ Dietary Guidelines for Americans, ``History of the Dietary Guidelines,'' https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/about-dietary- guidelines/history-dietary-guidelines (accessed December 16, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In the 2015 Dietary Guidelines process, the influential Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee veered off mission and attempted to persuade the USDA and HHS to adopt nutritional advice that focused not just on human health, but the health of the planet.\127\ Issues such as climate change and sustainability infiltrated the process. Fortunately, the 2020 process did not get diverted in this manner. However, the Dietary Guidelines remain a potential tool to influence dietary choices to achieve objectives unrelated to the nutritional and dietary well- being of Americans. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \127\ Daren Bakst, ``Extreme Environmental Agenda Hijacks Dietary Guidelines: Comment to the Advisory Committee,'' The Daily Signal, July 17, 2014, https://www.dailysignal.com/2014/07/17/extreme-environmental- agenda-hijacks-dietary-guidelines-comment-advisory-committee/ (accessed December 16, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- There is no shortage of private-sector dietary advice for the public, and nutrition and dietary choices are best left to individuals to address their personal needs. This includes working with their own health professionals. As it is, there is constantly changing advice provided by the government, with insufficient qualifications on the advice, oversimplification to the point of miscommunicating important points, questionable use of science, and potential political influence. The Dietary Guidelines have a major impact because they not only can influence how private health providers offer nutritional advice, but they also inform Federal programs. School meals are required to be consistent with the guidelines.\128\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \128\ Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, S. 3307, 111th Cong., 2nd Sess., https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/senate-bill/ 3307/text (accessed December 16, 2022), and Dietary Guidelines for Americans, ``Current Dietary Guidelines,'' https:// www.dietaryguidelines.gov/usda-hhs-development-dietary-guidelines (accessed December 16, 2022). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The next Administration should: Work with lawmakers to repeal the Dietary Guidelines. The USDA should help lead an effort to repeal the Dietary Guidelines. Minimally, the next Administration should reform the Dietary Guidelines. The USDA, with HHS, should develop a more transparent process that properly considers the underlying science and does not overstate its findings. It should also ensure that the Dietary Guidelines focus on nutritional issues and do not veer off-mission by focusing on unrelated issues, such as the environment, that have nothing to do with nutritional advice. In fact, if environmental concerns supersede or water down recommendations for human nutritional advice, the public would be receiving misleading health information. The USDA, working with lawmakers, should codify these reforms into law. Organizational Issues Based on the recommended reforms identified as ideal solutions, the USDA would look different in many respects. One of the biggest changes would be a USDA that is not focused on welfare, given that means-tested welfare programs would be moved to HHS. The Food and Nutrition Service that administers the food and nutrition programs would be eliminated. The Farm Service Agency, which administers many of the farm subsidy programs, would be significantly smaller in size if the ideal farm subsidy reforms were adopted. Most important, a conservative USDA, as envisioned, would not be used as a governmental tool to transform the nation's food system, but instead would respect the importance of efficient agricultural production and ensure that the government does not hinder farmers and ranchers from producing an abundant supply of safe and affordable food. For a conservative USDA to become a reality, and for it to stay on course with the mission as outlined, the White House must strongly support these reforms and install strong USDA leaders. These individuals almost certainly will be faced with opposition from some in the agricultural community who would fight changing subsidies in any fashion, although many of the reforms would likely be embraced by those in agriculture. There would be strong opposition from environmental groups and others who want the Federal Government to transform American agriculture to meet their ideological objectives. Finally, there would be opposition from left-of-center groups who do not want to reform SNAP and would expand welfare and dependency--such as through universal free school meals--as opposed to reducing dependency. Reducing the scope of government and promoting individual freedom may not always be easy, but it is something that conservatives regularly should strive for. The listed reforms to the U.S. Department of Agriculture would help to accomplish these objectives and are well worth fighting for to achieve a freer and more prosperous nation. Conclusion This chapter started with a discussion of the incredible success of American farmers and American agriculture in general. This is how the chapter should close as well. Americans are blessed with an agricultural sector, and a food system in general, which are worthy of incredible respect. A conservative USDA should appreciate this while recognizing that its role is to serve the interests of all Americans, not special interests. By being a champion of unleashing the potential of American agriculture, a conservative USDA would help to ensure a future with an abundant supply of safe and affordable food for individuals and families in the United States and across the globe.

Adams, a Representative in Congress from North Carolina Response from Ronald Rainey, Ph.D., Assistant Vice President, Professor, Division of Agriculture, University of Arkansas Question. As a member of the Equity Commission, you contributed to a report that detailed various policy recommendations for the Secretary of Agriculture to consider. Could you expand on Recommendation #20: County Committees? The Equity Commission Report detailed many policy recommendations to modernize the makeup of county committees. What do you think are the top four (4) policy recommendations for county committees that should be included in the next farm bill? Answer. In the EC Final Report, the recommendation was changed to #8: #8. Address historical and present-day inequitable services by making County Committees more equitable. The core recommendation centers on improving access to USDA programs and enhancing customer service for farmers and ranchers. Historically, the role of county committees has shifted, especially regarding farm loan decisions, and this has negatively impacted minority farmers. Despite these changes, county committees still hold significant power in determining access to USDA programs. The Commission aims to address ongoing inequities in current interactions between committees and farmers/ranchers. Key recommendations to be considered for the next farm bill include: 1. Training: Require diversity and multicultural training for county committee members to better understand the diverse backgrounds, production systems, and marketing channels of the farmers/ranchers they serve. Address the issue of farmers feeling misunderstood by committee members who may not respect or grasp their business models or scales. 2. Representation: Ensure county committees reflect the diverse agricultural production in their respective counties. While there has been a push for minority appoint- ments, all members should have voting power to influence committee deci- sions. Ensure committees understand the business models, structures, and objec- tives of all farmers/ranchers they serve. 3. Accountability: Establish oversight for County Executive Directors at district and state lev- els, with consequences for unethical or questionable decisions that raise civil rights or ethical concerns. Implement performance metrics evaluated through an equity lens to ensure consistent access to information, programs, and customer service for farm- ers. Address the power imbalance farmers face in the appeals process and cre- ate a system that holds committees accountable for their decisions. 4. Appeals Process: Develop a transparent, timely, and well-monitored appeals process that in- cludes oversight beyond the county level. This will ensure that decisions are tracked, irregularities are identified, and any improper behavior by commit- tees is addressed. These changes aim to improve the fairness, inclusivity, and effectiveness of county committees in serving the diverse needs of farmers and ranchers.
