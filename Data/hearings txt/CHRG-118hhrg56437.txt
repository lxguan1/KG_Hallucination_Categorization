BEYOND SCOPE: HOW THE SEC'S CLIMATE RULE THREATENS AMERICAN MARKETS ---------- Wednesday, April 10, 2024 U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Financial Services, Washington, D.C. The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:08 a.m., in room 2128, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Patrick McHenry  presiding. Members present: Representatives McHenry, Lucas, Sessions, Posey, Huizenga, Wagner, Barr, Williams of Texas, Hill, Emmer, Loudermilk, Rose, Steil, Timmons, Norman, Meuser, Fitzgerald, Garbarino, Kim, Donalds, Flood, Lawler, Nunn, De La Cruz, Houchin, Ogles; Waters, Sherman, Scott, Lynch, Green, Cleaver, Foster, Beatty, Vargas, Gottheimer, Gonzalez, Casten, Pressley, Horsford, Tlaib, Garcia, and Pettersen. Chairman McHenry. The Financial Services Committee will come to order. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a recess of the committee at any time. Today's hearing is entitled, ``Beyond Scope: How the SEC's Climate Rule Threatens American Markets.'' Before proceeding to the opening statements, I would like to engage with the ranking member in a colloquy. As Members know, we have been working to implement electronic voting in this committee for a number of years, in fact, in multiple Congresses. We have held three open houses prior to the April recess to educate Members and staff. We will hold another one after this hearing, and again tomorrow. Other committees have electronic voting, so members of this committee may have experienced it there. We will vote next week using electronic voting during our scheduled markup, and I want to take this opportunity to set up my expectations for how this will work for all Members. For the first markup only, we will conduct a quorum call to ensure all Members are able to use their electronic devices. From there, I will announce each request for recorded vote, as is the current practice, and open the vote for Members to cast their votes electronically. The goal here is for the electronics to be a timesaving device. I will work closely with the ranking member to ensure that all Democratic Members have cast their vote and all Members of the committee have the opportunity to cast their vote. As is the current practice, I will ask if all Members have had an opportunity to vote or wish to change their vote before closing the vote. From there, I will announce that the vote is closed. At that point, as is the current practice, I will ask the clerk to report. We will pause to accommodate technical issues. If a technical issue cannot be resolved for a Member, I will direct the clerk to call on that Member to record their vote orally. If more than five Members have issues with their voting devices, we will revert to calling the roll orally. And I would ask the ranking member if the ranking member is comfortable with that process? Ms. Waters. Oh, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate the practice sessions that you have afforded to all of the Members. And what you have explained with regard to execution of electronic voting seems very reasonable to me. Now, perhaps, I need a clarification on one thing. During a roll call vote, sometimes Members vote in error, and the calling of the roll provides me and my staff with additional time to verify if all Members have voted as they intended. If requested, will you accommodate requests from me for additional time before closing the vote to verify if all Members have voted as they intended? Chairman McHenry. Of course. I will always work with the ranking member and her members to ensure votes are cast as a member intends. Ms. Waters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your consideration on this effort, and I am looking forward to it. And I yield back. Chairman McHenry. Excellent. I want to thank the ranking member, and I want to thank the Democratic Financial Services Committee staff for working with the Republican staff on this matter. I know we started this initiative when she was Chair, pre-COVID, with the leadership of the House Administration Committee and Chairman Steil. I want to thank the House Administration Committee for making this more available to committees across the campus. I know other committees do this and do this well. And it is the intention of this committee to be able to move more expeditiously through votes while still accommodating Members' ability to vote, and I'm really grateful that we can close this process out and at least get rolling here. With that, I will now recognize myself for 4 minutes for an opening statement. We are here to discuss the Securities and Exchange Commission's recently-finalized climate disclosure rule, which will be disastrous for American markets, job creators, workers, and investors. It is costly, complex, and against the public good. The final rule is not a so-called compromise. It is yet another attempt by the Biden Administration to force its climate regulatory policy agenda on the public through financial regulation. I want to be clear. Climate change is real. Human activity contributes to it. It is a significant challenge that America and the world is grappling with and will continue to grapple with for decades to come. But this hearing is not about climate change; it is about the proper role of our securities regulator. So, when you hear Democrats accuse Republicans of being anti-science, they are proving our point that this rule is about the left's climate policy agenda, not simply standardizing corporate disclosures. The SEC is not a climate regulator, nor should it be. Congress has never authorized it to act as one. The final rule clearly exceeds the Commission's statutory mandate. This is par for the course with the current Securities and Exchange Commission. Whether it is inadequate public engagement, failing to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), attacking innovation, or issuing rules that exceed its authority, Chair Gensler's SEC clearly thinks it is above the law. And it is not just Republicans sounding the alarm. In the past 12 months, a Federal judge imposed sanctions on the Securities and Exchange Commission for its, ``gross abuse of power,'' in the DEBT Box case; the judge in the Ripple case criticized the Commission's lack of, ``faithful allegiance to the law,''; and the judge in the Grayscale case found that the SEC acted in an, ``arbitrary and capricious manner.'' It is clear that Chair Gensler's SEC is tarnishing the reputation of this very important institution. The final climate disclosure rule is yet another glaring example of the agency's overreach. First, the rule will significantly harm our markets and job creators. It will force public companies to decipher an 886-page rule, increasing costs for a public company by 21 percent, according to the SEC's own estimates. Many, including SEC Commissioner Peirce, have noted that this estimate is likely on the low end. Such a massive increase in compliance costs will impede firms from going or staying public. Oddly enough, the largest companies, often attacked by the progressive left, are the only ones which might be able to afford these enormous new costs. Second, the rule will crush everyday investors. Fewer public companies means fewer investment options for families to save and build wealth. Everyday investors will also be overwhelmed, not informed, by the amount of granular, complex, non-economic information required by the rule. Contrary to Democrats' claims, it is non-economic actors and progressive stakeholders who are demanding these climate regulations, not everyday investors. Finally, the climate rule will hurt American workers, who are already struggling to make ends meet under Biden economics. Increased costs will force companies to hire fewer employees, invest in fewer job-creating opportunities, and pass higher costs on to consumers. It is clear that the SEC's climate disclosure rule would be catastrophic for our markets and for American competitiveness. The Commission's stay on the rule is not enough. Instead, I urge Chair Gensler to abandon this regulatory power grab and return his focus to the statutory role of the SEC: protecting investors; maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitating capital formation. And if he doesn't, this Republican House will be forced to act. I yield back. The Chair now recognizes the ranking member of the committee, the gentlewoman from California, Ms. Waters, for 4 minutes for an opening statement. Ms. Waters. Good morning. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), last year was the hottest year on record. Mr. Chairman, climate change is real. It was with the realities of climate change in mind that the SEC finalized its long-awaited climate disclosure rule last month. This rulemaking is common sense. The climate crisis affects the financial health of public and private companies and investors. We have a right to know how the companies they own are responding to this crisis. Unfortunately, MAGA Republicans don't see it this way. Not only do they deny that climate change is real, but they also don't want anyone else to acknowledge its reality, either. My Republican colleagues want to block America's investors from knowing key information about stocks and outright ban them from making sustainable investments. Neither Congress nor our regulators can ignore the impact of the climate crisis on the financial system. In California, climate change-induced wildfires are leading to insurance company withdrawals, premium spikes, cancellations, and other restrictions on coverage for people all across the State. Nevertheless, MAGA Republicans downplay the climate crisis by inviting climate deniers as hearing witnesses and marking up legislation that prohibits regulators from mitigating such risk in our financial system. Despite the extreme MAGA effort to ban sustainable investing or ESG, Committee Democrats have been pushing the SEC to use its clear and longstanding tools to finalize and implement a strong climate rule to ensure investors receive the information they need. I am disappointed that the SEC, under immense pressure from MAGA and their corporate donors, didn't muster the political courage to adopt a bolder rule. Nevertheless, the SEC's rule, once implemented, will establish a clear framework to standardize climate disclosures, and in this sense, it is historic and overdue. Mr. Chairman, sustainable investing doesn't just benefit investors. It is also good for business and serves as a key element of capitalism, where investors get the opportunity to consider the true potential risks, rewards, and impacts of the investments they are making. Unfortunately, the SEC rule is being challenged by several well-funded special interests trying to eliminate it entirely. These groups have succeeded in forcing the SEC to pause its rule while they wait for the court to consider the lawsuit. Stopping government action on climate change is consistent with the aims of Project 2025, Mr. Trump's subversive and radical agenda to kill progress, prosperity, and freedoms in our country. The plan includes not just dismantling Federal and State climate-related policies, but also gutting the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), thereby making clean air and drinking water a luxury in our time. Committee Democrats will stand up to these attacks and make sure that people just trying to save for retirement or provide for their families have the information they need to make smart investment and economic decisions, and that Project 2025 never becomes a reality. With that, I yield back. Chairman McHenry. The gentlelady yields back. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Huizenga, who is also the Chair of our Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, for 1 minute. Mr. Huizenga. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Only in Washington can you add 350 pages of text and call it a clarification and a simplification. In a rush to appease the left, SEC Chair Gary Gensler finalized a nearly 900-page climate disclosure rule last month, which celebrated a, ``narrow approach.'' Look, let's not be fooled. The rule is still unworkable, no matter how much spin my Democrat colleagues put on it. In the 2 years since the climate disclosure rule was proposed, we have seen a deluge of new rules and an unprecedented assault on our capital markets. The Commission finalized the climate rule despite no clear authorization from Congress to do so. Although Chair Gensler has repeatedly reminded the public he is not a climate regulator--we agree-- under his leadership, the SEC has strayed far from its clear statutory mission. Investors should know that the SEC's overreach will significantly hurt our economy while serving as a boon for special interests and far-left activists. Unless he radically alters this approach to regulating our capital markets, his legacy will be that of an overzealous bureaucrat who has been repeatedly slapped down by the courts. Chairman McHenry. The gentleman's time has expired. Mr. Huizenga. I yield back. Chairman McHenry. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. Sherman, who is also the ranking member of our Subcommittee on Capital Markets, for 1 minute. Mr. Sherman. Today's hearing is an attack on capitalism. Under capitalism, those with capital are given the information that they want, to make capital allocation decisions as they decide, and the government's role is to make sure that information is reliable and comparable, and that a material percentage of American investors find that climate is material to their investment decisions. Under anti-capitalism, central planners let the government decide what factors should go into capital allocation decisions. And apparently, the Majority believes that the government has already decided that such decisions must be made solely on the basis of earnings per share, and is now working to deprive those with different criteria from getting the information that they need, and instead force them to fall in line with the government's capital allocation decisions. Investors want the information, and under real capitalism, we get it for them, and we make sure that it is reliable and comparable. I yield back. Chairman McHenry. The gentleman yields back. Today, we welcome the testimony of our five witnesses: Mr. Elad Roisman, a partner with Cravath, Swaine & Moore, and a former Commissioner and Acting Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; Mr. Robert Stebbins, a partner with Willkie Farr & Gallagher, and the former General Counsel of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; Mr. Joshua White, an assistant professor of finance at the Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt University; Mr. Chris Wright, the chief executive officer of Liberty Energy; and Professor Jill Fisch, the Saul A. Fox Distinguished Professor of Business Law at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Welcome. We thank each of you for being here. Each of you will be recognized for 5 minutes to give an oral presentation of your testimony, and without objection, your written statements will be made a part of the record. We have a lighting system, and just like in society, red and green mean certain things. Yellow specifically means, hurry up, because we are about done. So with that, Mr. Roisman, you are recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF ELAD L. ROISMAN, PARTNER, CRAVATH, SWAINE & MOORE LLP; AND FORMER COMMISSIONER AND ACTING CHAIRMAN, U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) Mr. Roisman. Thank you. Good morning, Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Waters, and members of the committee. Thank you for inviting me to testify today, and thank you to your staff for helping coordinate this hearing as well. My name is Elad Roisman. I am a partner at the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, but today, I am presenting my own views and not those of my firm or any client of the firm. My testimony and the views I will express today are informed by my nearly 20 years of experience in both the public and private sectors, working on securities, regulatory, and compliance matters affecting public companies and other securities market participants. In my practice at Cravath, amongst other matters, I advise public companies on disclosure, governance, and compliance. Prior to joining Cravath, I had the distinct honor and privilege of serving as a Commissioner and as the Acting Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. I was appointed to the SEC after serving as Chief Counsel for the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. And before that, I served as Counsel to then-SEC Commissioner Daniel M. Gallagher, as the Chief Counsel at NYSE Euronext, and as a corporate lawyer in private practice in New York. My statement today focuses on certain implementation challenges with respect to the SEC's newly-adopted rules requiring companies to disclose certain climate-related information and registration statements and annual reports. I believe that the final rules represent some of the most significant expansions of public company disclosure requirements in decades. Compliance with the new requirements will be a major undertaking for many public companies and will be costly. Some requirements will be particularly challenging given the compliance schedule mandated by the final rules. And while the SEC cites the goal of comparability and consistency as one of the primary reasons for this rulemaking, I fear that this may not be achieved given the different assumptions, estimates, and definitions that will underlie company disclosures. Furthermore, because some companies will make determinations of whether to disclose information based on evolving foreign and State laws, comparability and consistency will be especially hard to achieve. I believe companies will need to spend significant time and money in order to analyze, prepare for, and ultimately comply with the many new requirements of the final rules, costs that will ultimately be borne by investors. The final rules introduce a prescriptive, climate-related disclosure regime that is likely to result in extensive and granular disclosure on topics that many companies previously determined were not material to investors under SEC existing guidance and disclosure requirements. I hope that my testimony is helpful to members of the committee in highlighting some of the concerns and issues that public companies will be grappling with in complying with the final rules and some of the practical difficulties in the application. Thank you.  Chairman McHenry. Thank you for your testimony. We will now recognize Mr. Stebbins for 5 minutes. ROBERT STEBBINS, PARTNER, WILLKIE FARR & GALLAGHER LLP; AND FORMER GENERAL COUNSEL, U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) Mr. Stebbins. Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Waters, and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. The views expressed in this testimony are my own and do not necessarily represent the views of my current employer, Willkie Farr & Gallagher, or any client of the firm. The climate rules were adopted by the SEC in March 2024 pursuant to an adopting release of almost 900 pages. This followed a proposal in March 2022 that generated in excess of 24,000 comments. A recent memo published by a leading law firm called the rules, ``perhaps the most controversial rulemaking in SEC history.'' In my written testimony, I summarize certain recent Federal court challenges to the SEC rulemaking and then provide an analysis of legal challenges to the climate rules. A number of the rules recently adopted by the SEC have been challenged in the Federal courts, and the SEC has suffered a number of setbacks in these cases. These cases involve the proxy rules, the share repurchase rules, the private fund advisor rules, the dealer rules, the short sale rules, and the securities lending rules. Many of these challenges were heard in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. In addition, in 2022, the Fifth Circuit also ruled against the SEC in a case relating to the use of the SEC's administrative courts. This case was appealed to the Supreme Court, was argued in November, and a decision is pending. As to the current rules and the challenges, litigation challenging the climate rules ensued promptly after the rules were adopted, as expected. Petitions were filed in the Second, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and D.C. Circuits. A lottery system subsequently selected the Eighth Circuit to hear the consolidated cases, and then, on April 4th, the SEC issued an order staying climate rules pending the outcome of litigation in the Eighth Circuit. As to an overview of the legal challenges to the rules, Liberty Energy filed a motion for an administrative stay in the Fifth Circuit, arguing that climate rules violate three things--the major questions doctrine, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the First Amendment--and the SEC filed a response to this motion. So, I think those two filings give a pretty good roadmap as to the litigation to come. As set forth in my written testimony, for the reasons described in the testimony, I believe there is a strong basis for the Eighth Circuit and the Supreme Court to conclude that the climate rules violate the major questions doctrine as set forth in West Virginia v. EPA. As to the APA, for the reasons set forth in my testimony, I believe that a reasonable basis exists for the Eighth Circuit and the Supreme Court to find an APA violation. And as to the First Amendment challenges, First Amendment challenges are extremely difficult to win against the SEC in connection with its disclosure program. So, I think that is extremely less likely to see a successful challenge as to the First Amendment grounds. However, if the Supreme Court did set aside the climate rules based on First Amendment grounds, this decision would be potentially devastating to the SEC and would put substantial legal stress on many of its other ongoing reporting requirements, as the SEC depends on, ``compelled speech.'' My comments are in no way meant as a criticism of the staff of the SEC. I was General Counsel of the SEC for 4 years, and it was an honor to work with the SEC staff on a daily basis. I have the utmost respect for them. This is a rulemaking they were instructed to prepare, and people from my former office will be defending the rule in the Federal appellate courts, but this is a rulemaking that will be challenging for them to defend. Thank you very much. I look forward to answering any questions you may have.  Chairman McHenry. Thank you for your testimony. We will now recognize Mr. White. STATEMENT OF JOSHUA T. WHITE, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, FINANCE AND BROWNLEE O. CURREY JR. DEAN'S FACULTY FELLOW, OWEN GRADUATE SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY Mr. White. Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Waters, and members of the House Financial Services Committee, thank you for inviting me today to discuss the SEC's climate-related disclosure rule. I look forward to discussing this important issue, with the disclaimer that my views may not reflect those of my employer, Vanderbilt University. The adopted rules will require comprehensive climate- related disclosures, including those on governance, business strategy, targets and goals, greenhouse gas emissions, risk management, and financial statement metrics. Thus, it is crucial to consider the economic implications, which the SEC readily admits will substantially raise the direct costs of being a public company. The spillover effects of this rule could also have wide economic consequences, potentially leading companies to exit public markets or choose to stay private, reducing capital formation and job creation and limiting investment options for everyday investors. In my written testimony, I draw on my experience as a former SEC financial economist and my scholarly work on conducting cost-benefit analyses around rulemaking endeavors. I outline several critical issues concerning the SEC's economic analysis of the climate disclosure rule. I would like to draw your attention to three. First, I am concerned that the rule mandates costly and granular disclosures that are not economically material, such as Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. This concern is exacerbated by the SEC's economic analysis, which ignores recommendations and data provided by the public. Multiple commenters asked the SEC to conduct an event study on greenhouse gas emission disclosures. An event study is the classic test of whether information is economically meaningful to investors. Fortunately, University of Pennsylvania professor, Dan Taylor, conducted such a test study and found that the average greenhouse gas emission disclosure does not elicit a stock price response that is different from zero. Thus, we can expect that Scope 1 and Scope 2 disclosures will provide climate information that does not change stock price valuations for most investors. Rather than acknowledging these findings and the economic analysis, the SEC instead pointed to an academic publication with data that actually predates its 2010 climate- related guidance. Second, the SEC fails to make a convincing economic argument for prescriptive disclosures, as the existing principles-based system already mandates that registrants disclose material climate information. Studies show that following the SEC's 2010 guidance, registrants strengthened their climate risk disclosures, especially when they operated in industries where climate factors are more likely to impact their operations. The SEC's cost-benefit analysis discusses how climate risks are on average reflected in stock prices, likely due to this principles based disclosure that already exists. Thus, I expect that mandating additional information will provide limited benefits but will come at a substantial cost. This leads to my third point, which is that the SEC projects the climate disclosure rule will raise the cumulative disclosure burden for public companies by 20 percent. While this is no doubt an economically large amount, I am concerned that the SEC's final cost estimates are too low and do not capture the unintended consequences of the rule. Such a result would not be unexpected given that the SEC found compliance costs for provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley exceeded the estimates in the final rule by more than 350 percent. I believe the SEC should have re-proposed, not adopted, the final rule due to the substantial changes that were made, which would have allowed market participants to offer more precise compliance cost estimates following these changes. In closing, I am highly concerned that the climate-related disclosure rule will increase costs, with limited economic benefits for most shareholders. It can reduce the number of public companies, harm capital formation, and ultimately impede economic growth. I look forward to your questions.  Chairman McHenry. Mr. Wright, you are recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF CHRIS WRIGHT, FOUNDER, CHAIRMAN, AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, LIBERTY ENERGY INC. Mr. Wright. Thank you, Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Waters, and members of the committee. I am Chris Wright, the founder, chairman, and CEO of Liberty Energy. I am also the author of a new report on energy and climate change entitled, ``Bettering Human Lives 2024,'' and the founding chairman of the Bettering Human Lives Foundation, which is focused on expanding access to clean cooking fuels in Africa. Liberty Energy employs over 5,000 people and fracks roughly 20 percent of the onshore wells drilled in the United States and Canada. We are proud to say that about 10 percent of total primary energy production in the United States comes from wells fracked by Liberty. Liberty has been a leader in next- generation technologies that reduce our impacts. Two examples are Liberty's quiet frack fleets and our leadership in replacing diesel-powered frack fleets with natural gas fleets. While investors are keenly interested in our innovations that lower emissions of both air pollutants and greenhouse gases, I am not aware of any specific investor requests for reporting along the lines of the SEC climate rule. The SEC serves as an important regulator for our financial markets. Liberty has dealt with the SEC for many years. Both before our initial public offering (IPO), and for the 6 years that we have been a public company, we have had only positive and constructive interactions with the SEC. But now, the SEC is proposing to venture well outside of their lane without any congressional mandate to do so. We strongly oppose this destructive mission creep. Climate change is a complicated global issue that I have studied, written about, and spoken about for nearly 20 years, but it is certainly not in the SEC's purview. That is why about a month ago, Liberty instituted a challenge to the SEC's climate rule in Federal court and asked for the rule to be stayed pending this challenge. The SEC vigorously opposed the stay, but it was granted anyway by the Fifth Circuit. Last week, the SEC decided to stay the climate rule itself. We appreciate this gesture but remain committed to seeing this misguided rule dropped permanently. How might climate change impact Liberty's operations? Global average temperature has risen by roughly 2 degrees Fahrenheit over the last 150 years. Extrapolating the current rate of satellite-observed warming would imply roughly 2 more degrees Fahrenheit of warming by the end of this century. We operate at minus 30 degrees in North Dakota and at over 110 degrees in South Texas, a range of 140 degrees. A few degrees warmer simply will not impact our operations. What about extreme weather? We work in areas where tornadoes visit, and hurricanes and floods, too. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports no significant trend in these weather extremes. U.S. flood damage as a percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) has been on a downward trend since 1940, and global weather disaster losses as a percent of GDP have declined about 20 percent since 1990. Hence, there is no obvious growing threat to our business from extreme weather. Nevertheless, the SEC's climate rule mandates that public companies now must spend considerable resources to track and report impacts from the supposed changes of extreme weather events. Why? In our, ``Bettering Human Lives,'' report, we tallied the growth in global energy production by source since 2010. Natural gas is the fastest-growing source of energy in absolute, not relative terms, supplying nearly 40 percent of growth in global energy consumption. Oil is the second fastest- growing energy source. Hence, global demand for our industry's products is at a record high and rising. Liberty also has ownership stakes and partnerships with both a nuclear small modular reactor company and a leading next generation geothermal energy company. We have positive outlooks for both companies and their technologies. Where do we see climate risks for our business? In regulations, like those proposed by the SEC. These regulations will be costly to comply with and will invite litigation from a party seeking to hamper our industry. The net result will be to make it costlier and riskier to produce oil and gas in the United States, which surely will reduce U.S. production at the margin. The SEC climate rule will do nothing to reduce demand for oil and gas, while reducing U.S. production. Two results can be expected: higher costs for U.S. consumers and businesses; and increased oil imports. Outsourcing oil production to foreign countries like Iran, Russia, and Venezuela will certainly increase global greenhouse gas emissions and reduce energy security and economic well- being. Why impose a complex regulatory rule with no apparent climate benefit and easily-foreseeable downsides? What am I missing? Thank you.  Chairman McHenry. Professor Fisch, you are recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF JILL E. FISCH, SAUL A. FOX DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR OF BUSINESS LAW, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA CAREY LAW SCHOOL Ms. Fisch. It is an honor to participate in today's hearing. My name is Jill Fisch, and I am a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. As an academic, I have been teaching and writing about securities regulation for 35 years. Before that, I worked for a big law firm, and prior to that, at the Department of Justice. The U.S. capital markets are unparalleled throughout the world for their size and quality. They are important not just for businesses to raise capital, but for individuals. Today, more Americans own stock than ever before. Many depend on the strength of the capital markets to secure their savings for a home, the education of their children, and their retirement. The key to this success is Congress' wisdom in creating a disclosure-based system and tasking the SEC with determining the required disclosures. In adopting the Federal securities laws, Congress explicitly recognized the importance of market integrity to the broader public interest, stating that orderly and efficient capital markets contribute to the strength of the U.S. economy and protect interests beyond those of investors. Over its 90-year history, the SEC has made regular adjustments to address issues ranging from executive compensation, Y2K risks, cybersecurity, environmental risk, human capital, political risk, and the impact of COVID-19. In addition to quantitative disclosures, the rules focus on providing management's perspective on a company and its material risks. As part of this longstanding framework, the rule focuses on material climate-related risks and the impact of those risks on operations. My written testimony offers specific examples of how this information helps investors. Investors also use this information to evaluate management quality. It is a red flag if management is not monitoring risks that are likely to financially impact financial conditions. Voluntary disclosures are not the answer. They are often inconsistent, incomplete, inaccurate, and unreliable. In response, the rule increases standardization and comparability of key climate-related disclosures, reduces search costs, and it increases reliability by bringing these disclosures within the securities reporting process. Criticisms that the SEC's rule exceeds its authority by requiring disclosure of nonmaterial information are not well- founded. First, the rule limits required disclosures to information that is material to investors. Second, the SEC's authority has never been limited to requiring disclosures that are individually financially material, and there are many historical examples to the contrary. Simply put, the SEC acted squarely within its wheelhouse. This rule is the product of careful study, including analysis of thousands of public comments and the application of the SEC's technical expertise to the complex issue of capital market disclosure. Within that context, the rule is incredibly modest. It is a disclosure rule only. It mandates no change in business operations. It focuses on a small subset of the sustainability considerations that market participants identified as most important. It requires very limited and, in some cases, no disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions, although investor demand for them is overwhelmingly high. For example, the rule does not require any disclosure of Scope 3 emissions even when those emissions are material. The rule prioritizes disclosures where the potential for greenwashing is high, such as targets and transition plans. A review of the comment file provides ample basis for the SEC to have gone much further. The SEC has also adopted a variety of measures that reduce compliance costs, materiality qualifiers, limiting the required disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions, extended timelines for implementation, and safe harbors for liability. My written testimony has more on the tradeoffs the Commission made, and I am happy to address them in Q&A. Significantly, the SEC did not adopt this rule in a vacuum. The disclosure standards adopted by the EU, California, and the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) will require many large U.S. issuers to meet more-demanding standards than those in this rule. This suggests the SEC could have been more ambitious in its disclosure mandate or sought to reduce the impact of multiple and potentially-conflicting disclosure requirements. In the absence of any SEC reporting requirement or if the SEC rule is curtailed, it is likely that those alternative systems will set a different and higher baseline for climate-related disclosures. Thank you, Chairman McHenry, and Ranking Member Waters, for inviting me to participate in today's hearing, and I welcome your questions.  Chairman McHenry. Thank you all for your testimony. I very much appreciate it, and the committee appreciates it. I will now recognize myself for 5 minutes for questions. Mr. Wright, you are in a unique position, I think, to answer these questions. You comply with environmental law wherever you are doing projects. Is that correct? Mr. Wright. Absolutely. Chairman McHenry. And at the corporate level, you comply with the environmental laws of the United States? Mr. Wright. One hundred percent. Chairman McHenry. Okay. You also follow the securities laws. Is that correct? Mr. Wright. Yes, we do. Chairman McHenry. Okay. So, you know the distinction between your obligations in the securities marketplace to your investors, to your owners, to your shareholders, and to your board of directors. You also know the obligations under law to the environmental impacts of any actions you take wherever you are doing projects. So, what is the distinction here? When we have a securities regulator acting as an environmental regulator, what level of complexity does that add to projects to bring down the cost of energy, make it more available to the American people, to the world? How does that impact your investors? Walk us through the distinction between the environmental rules versus the securities rules. Mr. Wright. Yes. Of course, they are quite different and different people are involved with them. Obviously, it is our accounting and legal departments that do our SEC compliance or whatever. I am quite proud of the role our team plays in that. Environmental rules are very local as well. We operate a lot in Colorado, with the tightest regulations on, of course, not just greenhouse gas emissions, but on pollutants and noise and dust and all sorts of environmental regulations. We have a technical team that deals with Colorado about how to optimize, even helping them to understand what are the generators of pollutants, and how can we do this together better. But for the SEC to get into the very complex area of greenhouse gas emissions, to me, the thing right up front is they are going to get it wrong. It is very hard. It is easy to track dollars and cents precisely. They come into an account, and they leave an account. Greenhouse gas emissions are quite complex. It is not just what engine is burning what fuel. It is what is the temperature, what is the fuel mix, how good is the combustion, how is the engine tuned. You can't specifically and directly measure greenhouse gas emissions. It is all about guesstimates, and if we were told to take guesstimates---- Chairman McHenry. With your securities filings, are guesstimates okay with your accountants and lawyers? Mr. Wright. They are not. Chairman McHenry. And post-Sarbanes-Oxley, there are consequences when you are guesstimating in a corporate environment? Mr. Wright. I sign my name every quarter that---- Chairman McHenry. Okay. So, you are going to sign your name on a set of disclosures, that you have just said as an expert in this field, in this energy production field, in this specific field that is going to be very impacted by the set of rules, that the best estimate you have in a business that has dollars and cents attached to investments, the best estimates we get in greenhouse gas emissions are guesstimates. Mr. Wright. They are guesstimates. Chairman McHenry. And you are going to have to certify under the same penalties that apply to your corporate disclosures, whether or not you are rigging accounting, the same standards on guesstimates. Okay. Mr. Wright. That is my biggest concern. It will invite litigation, an effort that won't go towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions or improving our business or our operations or any of those things. Chairman McHenry. Okay. You will be---- Mr. Wright. It will be, how do we minimize our litigation risk? Chairman McHenry. The Securities and Exchange Commission has justified the climate rule by saying that investors, ``want,'' and ``need,'' the type of information required by this rule. You talk to your investors regularly, at least quarterly, right? Mr. Wright. Absolutely. Chairman McHenry. You spend a lot of time with activists in this space. Are they asking for this type of disclosure? Do they want this type of disclosure? Mr. Wright. I have never heard a request for anything remotely like what is in the SEC rules. But yes, we do engage in dialogues with our customers about greenhouse gas emissions, what we are doing, the trends in those technologies that can improve them, absolutely. Chairman McHenry. And materiality, right? You are in a business that is dealing with carbon, and disclosures around carbon and carbon emissions are material to your business you already disclosed. Is that correct? Mr. Wright. We do. Chairman McHenry. Yes. Mr. Wright. We do. Chairman McHenry. Okay. Mr. Roisman, let's talk about materiality, which is a basic underpinning of securities law. If you just would give me a little color there, as my time is about to run out. Mr. Roisman. With materiality, most people think of the Supreme Court cases, Basic v. Levinson, and TSC Industries v. Northway. And it has always been this concept that there is a substantial likelihood that the information is material if a reasonable investor would consider it important in making an investing or a voting decision, or such a reasonable investor would find the omission of that disclosure to substantially or significantly alter the total mix of information. It is a longhand way of saying, is this information important for investors from the eyes of a company about what will be impactful to that company? Chairman McHenry. And this climate rule is different than this question of materiality that has been longstanding? Mr. Roisman. The level of prescriptive disclosure makes this unlike any rule of which I am aware. Chairman McHenry. Okay. We will now recognize the ranking member of our Capital Markets Subcommittee, Mr. Sherman, for 5 minutes. Mr. Sherman. Thank you. It is long past time that companies report how resilient they are, and hopefully move to become more resilient, and it is long past time that companies report what effect they have on our climate, and hopefully, society will insist that they try to reduce that effect. Mr. White points out that all the burdens of these regulations are falling on publicly-traded companies, and I agree with him. And I hope this committee will consider legislation so that multibillion-dollar private companies will also make these same disclosures, because they have the same effect on our climate, and because the stakeholders in a company are not just the shareholders who might be private, but the public as well. There have been comments on the cost of these disclosures. I will point out that many of these companies have to do reporting anyway because of the European Union or because of a number of States, including my own progressive State of California, so this may not add much to their costs at all. I am hoping that as we move forward, the States, the SEC, and the European Union will do even more to harmonize their regulations. Mr. White points out that stock prices don't change often as a result of revealing this information. First, one would expect the stock price to change only when the information that is revealed is different from market expectations. If a company comes in with earnings per share exactly what the market expects, the price of the stock doesn't change. Also, we may see no change in the price because some choose to sell because they are green investors, and others choose to buy because they are anti-green investors who think that, well, the green investors have sold. I have a chance to pick up a bargain. So even if the price doesn't change, the makeup of the shareholders change, and green and anti-green shareholders have a right to the information they need. Mr. Wright says that climate change is not a problem for the operations of his natural gas company. I will simply point out that a report on the 215 largest public companies indicates that they will incur over a trillion dollars of losses over the next 5 years as a result of climate change. Whether his particular company is affected, I will leave to him. I think the SEC has done a good job on climate. We now have to move toward other necessary disclosures. I have been an advocate here of looking at workforce disclosures and disclosures about one's exposure to China, because an invasion of Taiwan is certainly a possibility, and the economic effects of that would be enormous and shareholders ought to know, so I want to focus on workforce. Over 100 years ago, the price of the stock was very close to the balance sheet. Today, 90 percent of the value has nothing to do with what is on the balance sheet. The most valuable asset isn't on the balance sheet; it is the company's workforce. Professor Fisch, should we require companies to report information about their workforce? Among this would be turnover rates, employee training expenses, diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, and how diverse their upper management is; is that a good project for the SEC? Ms. Fisch. Mr. Sherman, absolutely. When I said that this was sort of a small step in terms of sustainability disclosure, investors have been asking the SEC for dozens of years not just for modest climate-related disclosures, but disclosures with respect to the range of new and challenging issues that go to a company's resilience, and human capital management is right up there at the center of those issues. Human capital management raises new challenges for companies, both because an increasing percentage of their assets are their workforce and because there are evolving issues: worker safety, worker turnover, sexual harassment. All of those things are critical in understanding a company's business plan, its strategic vision, and the quality of its management. Mr. Sherman. In addition, the other asset that isn't on the balance sheet is research and development (R&D), and I have urged on many occasions and often with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that R&D expenses be capitalized. And finally, we now have bipartisan legislation to require companies to describe their China risk because that will give them some incentive to try to derisk. And to the extent they were derisked, that creates a greater likelihood that China will not invade Taiwan, because we will be able to stand up to them if they do. I yield back. Chairman McHenry. We will now recognize the Vice Chair of the committee, Mr. Hill, for 5 minutes. Mr. Hill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you, and the Chair of our Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Ann Wagner, and Representative Bill Huizenga of Michigan, for your good work on guiding the response to the SEC agenda on environmental, social, and governance (ESG), particularly on, ``E,'' during this Congress. Mr. Stebbins, it is good to see you. It's good to have you back at the committee. When you were General Counsel of the SEC, I think you were involved in some 80 different rulemakings during your time as General Counsel. Were you accused by the Federal courts of being arbitrary and capricious when you were the General Counsel? Mr. Stebbins. I don't remember if we were or not, and the SEC certainly gets sued on every major rulemaking. It just happens. The Gensler administration has had a number of major rulemakings, but I don't recall, sir, everywhere, but I think our record was pretty good on rulemaking. Mr. Hill. And did you ever have a Federal court suggest that you had to pay the plaintiff's legal expenses due to a poor ruling by the SEC? Mr. Stebbins. I don't recall that. Mr. Hill. I think we have seen that in this Administration, under Chairman Gensler, and we have seen bipartisan response here on this committee that Chairman Gensler has moved some 60 rulemakings, and in your testimony, you outline just a tremendous number of challenges with them. I thought it would be useful to ask you some questions about the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and how do we get a better process here in the Financial Services Committee of overseeing the SEC on that? The final climate rule dramatically differs from the proposal. They got 97,000 comments or something like that. By removing mandatory Scope 3 emissions and adding new requirements, is this something that, if you would have been General Counsel, you would have recommended? Mr. Stebbins. I think I would have recommended that they send it back out for comment. Logical outgrowth is the theory they would be relying on. I just think it was substantially changed with the removal of most of the Scope 3 requirements as well as the 1-percent financial statement test, I think, to the better. But I think in many ways, it is a large release. It is a 900-page adopting release, and the comments were obviously extensive, but a lot of people were focusing on those two topics, maybe to the exclusion of other topics. And when those two topics were out of there, I think the focus was going to perhaps go more to the other topics. I would have re-proposed it. I don't know if that is going to be fatal to the SEC in their court case, but I would have recommended it, yes. Mr. Hill. And I misspoke. It is not 97,000 comments; it is only 24,000 comments, so I want to let the record be straightened out there. In your testimony on share repurchase rules, the Fifth Circuit again said the SEC acted arbitrarily and capriciously and said they failed to conduct a proper cost- benefit analysis. The SEC is required to do a cost-benefit analysis for rules they propose, isn't that right, Mr. Stebbins? Mr. Stebbins. That is correct. It was a Fifth Circuit decision vacating the share repurchase rules and vacating them on two grounds: number one, failure to conduct a proper economic analysis/cost-benefit analysis; and number two, failure to show a genuine problem existed. They went back to the staff and asked them to show the problem, and they weren't able to do it, or at least they said they weren't going to be able to do it, so the Court vacated the rule. So, those will be the challenges they will face again, the same arguments in this litigation. Mr. Hill. To me, it seems like the problem is that we don't have a high-quality standard at the Commission for conducting a cost-benefit analysis. In your testimony, you talked about it, Chairman McHenry mentioned it, and 79 percent of respondents asserted that the SEC underestimates the cost of compliance with all of its proposed rules. And in this particular rule, the range was from $197,000 to $739,000 for annual compliance costs, in Mr. Wright's point of view. What do we need to do as Congress to make sure and hold the SEC to a high standard, that there is a methodology that is defensible, whether you are at Penn or at Vanderbilt, anchor down, to have a decent cost- benefit analysis? Mr. Stebbins. I think Professor White is probably in a better position than I am to talk about the cost aspects. I thought the cost numbers were likely going to end up too low based on that. Law firms are now billion-dollar entities. The going rate in New York City is over $2,000 an hour, so I am guessing they are going to end up too low on these estimates, given the complexity of the rule, but it remains to be seen. Mr. Hill. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Chairman McHenry. We will now recognize the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Scott, for 5 minutes. Mr. Scott. Thank you very much. Professor Fisch, you are a great professor at the great University of Pennsylvania, and I am a graduate of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. And I want to give you a very gracious welcome to our committee, and please give my regards to the Wharton School. That great professor, George W. Taylor, was a good friend to me, and please tell my friends at the Wharton School, hello, and please keep doing your good work. Professor Fisch, the SEC's climate risk disclosure rule encompasses a strong set of standards that meet investors' demands for mandatory corporate transparency as well as companies' need for clarity. Is that right? Ms. Fisch. Yes, sir, and thank you for your kind words about the Wharton School. That is exactly right, and what I think distinguishes this rule from so many others is just the overwhelming investor demand for this information and investors' insistence that despite everything that the SEC has done to encourage climate-related disclosure, investors are not getting the information they need. Mr. Scott. Let me ask you this also, Professor Fisch. Do you believe that many of the registrants who would be impacted can and should be prepared to make these disclosures before the final rule requires them to do so? Ms. Fisch. That is a great question. And that is one of the reasons that it is so tricky to do a cost-benefit analysis in this system, because you have so many things going on. Just in the 2 years between the original rule proposal and the SEC's adoption of the final rule, the technology in this area has improved by leaps and bounds. Many more companies are disclosing this information voluntarily, and as I elaborate on in my written remarks, there are other regulators who are going to demand this information regardless of what the SEC does. Mr. Scott. Would you agree that this is an aggressive enough timeline now? Ms. Fisch. I think it is a very generous timeline. I think that you also have to keep in mind the fact that regardless of whether there is a mandate, many companies are disclosing some or all of this information voluntarily, and every year increasing their voluntary disclosure in response to investor demands. At the same time, because there isn't a uniform baseline, that information is located in multiple places. It is hard to compare. It is not standardized. Mr. Scott. Does the timeline that the SEC adopted generally align with many U.S. companies' compliance dates for the EU's corporate sustainability reporting directives and the California laws? Ms. Fisch. Both of those standards are still evolving, but I would say at least in some cases, the SEC's timelines are more generous than those other regulators. Mr. Scott. And I want you to know, Professor Fisch, that I am also appreciative that the SEC chose not to take any actions that could lead intentionally or unintentionally to burdensome reporting requirements for production agriculture. You see, I am also the ranking member of the House Agriculture Committee. My question is, would it be burdensome reporting requirements for production agriculture when their goods are part of the supply chain for a publicly-related company? Ms. Fisch. You are absolutely right. The SEC, I think, was very careful in the scope of what it mandated, but again, companies that aren't subjected to the mandate still have to report to the extent that they are dealing with customers, suppliers, and third parties who are demanding that information. And in many cases, large companies with climate- responsible policies are asking for that information from their counterparties. Mr. Scott. Thank you very much, and please keep up the good work. Chairman McHenry. We will now recognize the gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Lucas, who is also the Chair of the House Science Committee. Mr. Lucas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and while it will be a great day when that happens, I would note to my colleague, the ranking member, that we are not quite there yet, David, and we also have a slightly different definition of how agriculture is impacted by these SEC issues. Mr. Scott. Well, once a chairman, you are always a chairman, and you are the same chairman. Mr. Lucas. You are obviously a great ranking member. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That said, since the Biden Administration could not successfully implement its climate agenda through Congress when they controlled both Houses, of course, and the White House, it has turned to the agencies to implement climate policy unilaterally. At the SEC, the climate rule aims to implement climate policy under the guise of security regulation. Mr. Wright, you discussed in your testimony, and with Chairman McHenry, how your company has been impacted by this SEC rule. Could you expand on that, on how this rule goes beyond the purpose of securities regulation? Mr. Wright. Yes, absolutely. Again, securities regulation is essential, and the SEC has done a great job. My beef is not with the SEC, but, yes, this is going into a complex topic of climate change, for which we don't get specific numbers like we do for financial accounting. My other, maybe philosophical problem with it is, what is the net impact going to be? We are going to get sued more. It is going to be harder to do business in this industry. We backed a very small company, Nomad, which had a technology to produce sand instead of at a mine, and you get a truck at 60 miles, a mine right near the well so that we could reduce driving truck traffic, not drive the sand. Of course, our industry is striving to do things better. But now, that little private company, a couple of scrappy entrepreneurs-- since we are their dominant investor, we have some control over them--is going to have to figure out how they are going to count their greenhouse gas emissions instead of running their small business so that we can report them up the chain. I view it as cumbersome, clunky, and not really a climate policy. How are we going to drive innovation and improve greenhouse gas emissions by making best guesstimates on subjective numbers as opposed to talking about technologies and big pictures and real progress? Mr. Lucas. Clearly, no industry is insulated from this, and the energy sector is seriously harmed, and manufacturers of all sizes will be impacted, and I think, very clearly, the climate rule hit farmers and ranchers, too. Some supporters of the final rule have praised the complete removal of the disclosure requirements for Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions. Unfortunately, I think this is a mischaracterization of the rule. While the rule scales back the explicit disclosure requirements for Scope 3 emissions, many public companies must still collect emissions data from their supply chains to comply with this rule. Mr. Roisman, could you discuss how public companies in many instances will still need to collect this greenhouse gas information, this data? Mr. Roisman. I will say this. I think many companies are relieved that they will not have to do explicit line-item Scope 3 disclosure. However, there are interpretive questions today about what companies may have to do. And one such example is if a company decides that they have a material climate-related target or goal, something that could be net zero or a reduction in Scope 3 emissions, they are required to provide investors with enough information to understand the progress they have made. And if you are required to talk about progress, you are going to have to talk about Scope 3, and how you have done every year. So, I think there is a concern that even though there is no line-item disclosure, you are still going to qualitatively at least have to talk about how you are meeting those goals and the progress you made, and this is an issue that is unclear in the rule. People are scouring footnotes, and looking at statements. And if the SEC wants to clarify that you won't have to do any Scope 3 emissions disclosure, I am hopeful that they are going to do that soon. Mr. Lucas. Mr. Stebbins, could you offer your expertise on this? Mr. Stebbins. I am a securities lawyer. I would tell people, if they are setting goals or have set goals, they are going to need to do Scope 3 work in order to do the analysis to give people an update based on what I read in the release. And also, I would say that, as it says, you only have to put Scope 1 and 2, and if material, the only way to judge materiality is to do the work. Even if you are not reporting it, you are still going to have to do the work determining 1 and 2. But I think 3 is in there, the way I read the rule, and there is also something in there about reaching out to your suppliers and determining the effects and your customers and suppliers based on climate risks to your business. So to say that the food chain up and down your value chain of customers and suppliers isn't going to be affected by this, I think is an overstatement. Chairman McHenry. The gentleman's time has expired. Mr. Lucas. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Chairman McHenry. The gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. Lynch, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Lynch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Professor Fisch, the traditional role of the SEC and a central tenet of our securities laws aims to protect investors. And because of the asymmetry of information that exists where companies have all the information and an innocent investor may have very little, there is a need for disclosures, and that is sort of a framework that encapsulates the relationship between the SEC and these companies wishing to sell securities and investors. Is that a fair statement? Ms. Fisch. Yes, sir. Mr. Lynch. Okay. So as part of that investment decision, an investor needs to know the risks, correct? Ms. Fisch. Absolutely. Mr. Lynch. And from what we see in the world around us, climate change is a tangible risk. It is ongoing. It may affect some companies greater than others, but the bottom line here is that an investor is entitled to that information, and that has long been the practice. That is not a departure from the SEC's mission; that is a founding principle within the SEC. Is that correct? Ms. Fisch. Yes, that has been true since the 1930s. The SEC's disclosure mandate is to ensure that investors get all the information they need, and that includes information about material risks and how management is identifying and responding to those risks. Mr. Lynch. And a consequence of the lack of disclosure, especially in today's world, I think is described well by the folks over at Better Markets. They wrote, ``The failure to disclose risks, regardless of the source, prevents investors from properly evaluating companies, causes those companies and markets to be mispriced, and distorts capital formation and allocation, which eventually harms the economy, jobs, and growth.'' Do you agree with that statement? Ms. Fisch. Yes, I do. Mr. Lynch. So, the rule itself just requires disclosure. It doesn't require any action. Is that a fair statement? Ms. Fisch. Yes, that is a fair statement. Mr. Lynch. And what advantages do you see, not only in the climate context, but generally, for the strength of our markets? The SEC was established in response to the collapse of our markets in the 1920s, and it restabilized the markets themselves and induced consumer confidence to the point where we are the envy of the world in our markets. We have deep and strong markets, where investors feel like they are protected. By limiting disclosures to investors, would this harm the integrity of our markets? Ms. Fisch. I don't believe the rule limits disclosures to investors. Mr. Lynch. No, no, no, no, no. It is just the opposite. Ms. Fisch. Right. Mr. Lynch. It is the opposite. Ms. Fisch. I believe what the rule does is respond to a very real and very longstanding investor demand, and I think that is entirely consistent with protecting the integrity of our markets, the reputation of our markets. And I would say that reputation doesn't just attract U.S. companies to list, but it attracts companies and investors from all over the world. Mr. Lynch. Right. One of the things I noticed the other day is that the cost of a kilowatt hour in Europe is about triple what it is in the United States, even though we have robust regulatory frameworks in place. And I am curious if you know of instances where the greater disclosure not only helps the investor, but it helps the integrity of the industry itself? Ms. Fisch. I think that is exactly right, and one of the advantages of broad-based disclosure is so that the market and investors can do comparisons, right? They are not just getting some selective sample of companies, but they are looking across an industry and able to identify, well, what is reasonable, and what is reasonable in the oil and gas industry might be quite different from what is reasonable in technology. Mr. Lynch. That is great. Mr. Chairman, my time has expired. I yield back. Chairman McHenry. The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Posey, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Posey. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. In the words of a really common-sense writer by the name of Robert Ringer, I think this will be classified as another case of the government being the omnipresent defender of nonexistent problems with the people. Right now, at the height of inflationary concerns of my constituents who are paying more for everything, I am sure none of them are looking forward to paying more for their stocks because of the non-value-added costs that this proposed rule is going to add to it by an agency that let Robert Ringer literally run free after being warned numerous, numerous times. This guy is probably doing nothing for 10 years. Now, they are going to be the climate police, and I guess the next step is that they will criminalize any stock purchase that they don't think is proper in their view. Mr. Roisman, can a typical noninstitutional investor really make use of the required climate change disclosures to make better investment decisions? We are talking the average guy in the street. Mr. Roisman. I am afraid I haven't been at an asset management shop that has shown me how greenhouse gas emissions works into their portfolio theory. Mr. Posey. Mr. Wright, does this rule increase or decrease the chances that the United States will have a sound diversified energy strategy, and why? Mr. Wright. I think it decreases the chances. I think the net result is likely less production here. More production imported from overseas, to me, would be the expected net outcome of the rule. Mr. Posey. Okay. Clearly, in concert with the rest of this Administration's agenda to make America last. We have heard from the MAGA integrators already. Mr. Stebbins, does this rule meet the Supreme Court's major questions doctrine in terms of its foundation on congressional authority? Mr. Stebbins. I think it is going to be a difficult lift for the Commission in that regard. I think there is a strong likelihood that the Eighth Circuit and the Supreme Court will strike the rule down based on the major questions doctrine. The major questions doctrine talks about when you are outside your area of expertise, which is in Justice Kagan's well-written dissent. She talks about being outside your typical area of expertise. In my experience at the SEC, that is certainly the case here. And doing something of large economic and political significance is going to be a difficult area for the SEC as well, and then, you need to look to a specific congressional authorization if those other two criteria are met. The SEC does not have a specific authorization here. They have just the general investor protection mandate. So, those will be the questions that the courts will be looking at, I think, in the criteria. Mr. Posey. To add to a better than a thousand-to-one odd that a consumer is hauled into court for violation of a Federal law made by some unaccountable, unrecallable, bureaucrat, not by people that they elected to make their laws like they think. Mr. Roisman, do you really believe this rule will have any effect on the world climate as their proponents hope it will? Mr. Roisman. I think that Mr. Wright is a better judge of that, sir. I am not a climate scientist. Mr. Posey. Mr. Stebbins, to disclose things like climate- related goals, climate transition plans, climate scenario analysis, and internal carbon pricing really become a mandate to have such things because companies will be afraid not to have them. Mr. Stebbins. I think the way this is going to be judged is there is already, as I think most of you know, a requirement to disclose all material, economic, or all material risk, which includes environmental risks that are already out there. So if you are requiring other information to be disclosed that might be viewed as nonmaterial, then you are looking at a cost- benefit analysis, right? And then, you are trying to determine what is the cost of this disclosure and what is the benefit of the disclosure, and that is going to be the area where all of these requirements will be judged. If there were two or three, I think it is an easier case than when there are 30. So, that is how I would put it. Mr. Posey. Thank you. My time has expired. I yield back. Mrs. Wagner. . The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, for 5 minutes. Mr. Green. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I thank the ranking member, I thank the witnesses for appearing, and I especially thank you, Ms. Fisch, for being here today. You have brought some degree of balance to the panel. I especially appreciate the fact that the Democratic staff invited you to come to give some degree of balance to the panel. And without going into any specificities, are you familiar with the entities that these four White men work for? Ms. Fisch. Yes, I am. Mr. Green. Are there smart women working for these entities? Ms. Fisch. I believe there are, yes. Mr. Green. Are there women working for these entities who could testify about the issues before us today? Ms. Fisch. I couldn't answer that question, sir. Mr. Green. I see, but you believe they are smart. Ms. Fisch. I do. Mr. Green. Okay. Thank you very much. Let's go on with the traditional questioning. I have a question for you, but within the question, I have a question. So I will read the question, and then I will go to the question within the question, and I thank the staff for assisting. The question is, can you explain how these rules will help to protect retail investors who might otherwise struggle to obtain or interpret climate-related risk information about their investments? That is the question. But the question within the question is, define, if you would, please, what a retail investor is, for the public? Ms. Fisch. Thank you. Retail investors are regular people like us as opposed to institutional investors, mutual funds, pension funds, and so forth, and most retail investors invest through intermediaries. Many of us have stock in mutual funds, in our retirement plans, right? The way this rule helps is the people who run those retirement plans have come to the SEC for years, and they have said, we need this information, and we need this information for several reasons. One, it helps us understand the financial value, the economic value, the sustainability of these companies in which we are investing our customers' retirement savings, right? And we have a fiduciary duty to collect and evaluate all material information. We need it. We are not getting it. But there is a little bit more. Retail investors have a variety of investment preferences. Some of them want to invest in carbon zero funds. Some of them want to invest in the Catholic values fund. So institutional investors have an obligation, as part of this robust capital market, to satisfy those different investor preferences, but you can't construct a fund that meets those preferences without having access to the underlying information. Mr. Green. And is it true that the larger investors, some of them have persons available to them to do research to help them to acquire the intelligence that you have referenced? Is this a fair statement? Ms. Fisch. It is a fair statement. But one of the, I think, repeated statements in the SEC's comment record is that even the largest investors are spending hundreds of thousands, in some cases, millions of dollars, trying to obtain this information. They are paying third-party providers, they are asking companies to fill out extensive questionnaires because they are not getting this information in securities disclosure. Mr. Green. And the retail investors, people like you and me and other persons who are investing in retirement accounts, don't have the wealth to acquire this level of intelligence, do they? Ms. Fisch. That is absolutely right. Mandatory disclosure, as you say, creates a level playing field for all investors. Mr. Green. And as we are going about doing this--making sure that we level the playing field is the way I see it, so that the retail investors, the people who just don't have the millions, can make proper investments. As we go about doing this, is there a way to do it other than to require some disclosure and try to make it uniform? Ms. Fisch. Congress decided in the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act that mandatory disclosure was the best, the most-efficient system for getting that information to all investors. Mr. Green. I want you to know I stand with these retail investors. I stand with the average person who is trying to make an investment, and I want the playing field leveled for that average person. Right now, they are at a disadvantage. This rule can help us to give them the same opportunities to invest as other investors. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I yield back. Mrs. Wagner. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Huizenga, who is also the Chair of our Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, and also heads up our Climate Change Commission, Mr. Huizenga, for 5 minutes. Mr. Huizenga. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. Like Chairman McHenry highlighted, the SEC's climate rule has deviated from the materiality standard, which will leave investors to be, ``second-guessed,'' by the SEC. Materiality qualifiers also ensure that companies must disclose climate-related items that the SEC staff has considered important, not investors. Mr. Roisman, can you explain how special interest groups can take advantage of disclosures borne out by rules such as this? Earlier, we heard from one of my colleagues' statements that well-funded special interests are suing the SEC. I am sure, Mr. Stebbins, you never saw a well-funded special interest sue the SEC while you were General Counsel, but, Mr. Roisman, how can these well-funded, special, left-leaning interest groups sue the SEC to take advantage? Mr. Roisman. For better or worse, anyone can really sue the SEC, as we have seen. What I do think---- Mr. Huizenga. We will get to Mr. Wright shortly. Mr. Roisman. I think one of the concerns people are raising about this rule, and it is echoed in the statements of SEC Commissioner Uyeda, is that by creating sort of a special set of rules relating to climate, you are making it stand apart. And historically, what the rule has been is companies need to provide information that is material to investors, and it is up to companies to do that because they are, frankly, in the best place to do it. Mr. Huizenga. Okay. I wish some of my colleagues on the other side would think as highly about a female and a minority voice on the SEC opposing this as well. It seems to me that you have been lumped in a group as well. Mr. Wright, are you a well-funded special interest? Mr. Wright. I am not. Mr. Huizenga. Okay. I didn't think so. It sounds like you are a business person. As you know, many companies have been unwilling to stick their neck out like that. Why have you decided to do so? Mr. Wright. I think the issue is just simply too important. We get trade groups. Everybody is going to sue on it, but we are very passionate about this topic. And it impacts not just our company, but our entire industry, and ultimately, I think it impacts the United States' energy system, and being by far the largest producer of energy in the world, that affects the world energy system. So, I am very passionate about having thoughtful, open dialogue in evaluating tradeoffs and how to make those inevitable tradeoffs between the energy system and climate change. But a bureaucratic reporting rule that will lead companies to, in reality, get sued, I don't see that constructiveness in that. Mr. Huizenga. Materiality sounds like a pretty good watchword. Mr. Stebbins, someone was asking you, and you were kind of getting cut off on the time, I think it was Mr. Posey-- supposedly Scope 3 was, ``pulled out,'' but we are hearing that there are going to be some real ramifications, and it may not actually have the same effect. Mr. Stebbins. The statistics show that a lot of companies do set goals in this area, and to the extent you have set goals, I think Scope 3 is going to be implicated based on the adopting release. And I think also, it talks about transition plans, which are defined very broadly to mean plans that a company is using to reduce its environmental risks, and in connection with those plans, if you have such, and most companies will, Scope 3 again comes into play. So, I think it is an overstatement to say it is totally out of the release. Has that lessened? Yes, it has lessened. Mr. Huizenga. Okay. Has the SEC stated its own rules previously? Mr. Stebbins. It has happened before. It happened in the D.C. Circuit when I was there. Mr. Huizenga. I have to move quickly here. And then, when there are major issues, court cases, legal challenges, et cetera, with a rule, and the SEC would voluntarily stay its own rule, would it add an implementation time cushion on the tail end of that? Mr. Roisman, feel free to weigh in on that as well. Basically, would you grant an additional year before you are doing any kind of implementation? Mr. Stebbins. I think practitioners will expect the SEC, depending on how long the litigation goes, to adjust the timeframes. I think that is next. Mr. Huizenga. So that is reasonable, Mr. Roisman? Mr. Roisman. I think it is more than reasonable. I would certainly hope. Mr. Huizenga. It should be expected? Mr. Roisman. I hope, yes. Mr. Huizenga. Would it be helpful if the SEC actually weighed in right now and said, we are going to give it one year? Mr. Roisman. Very much so. Mr. Huizenga. Okay. That is something I intend to pursue with them. Mr. Stebbins, I only have a few seconds, but you had hit on the APA as well, and I am sorry, Mr. White, I can't get to my question for you. I am going to be doing a follow-up on that. But it seems to me that the economic analysis to adequately consider the impacts of the rule wasn't done, so we will follow up with you on that. I yield back. Mrs. Wagner. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now recognizes the ranking member of the committee, the gentlewoman from California, Ms. Waters, for 5 minutes. Ms. Waters. Thank you. Professor Fisch, although I welcome the SEC's latest step in creating a standardized climate disclosure framework, I was nonetheless disappointed that the SEC's final rule fell short of the original proposal. In particular, the rule exempts Big Banks and insurance companies from disclosing their greenhouse gas emissions, even though it is known as Scope 3 emissions and gives license to companies to avoid disclosing any of their greenhouse gas emissions if they decide it is not material. The final rule also lessened requirements that companies disclose the potential impacts of transition risks. Do you agree these are areas where the SEC can improve the efficacy of its rules in the future? Ms. Fisch. Yes, I do, and, in particular, I wanted to focus on transition risks, targets, and announced goals, because the issue has come up in several questions. Aren't companies inadvertently going to have to disclose Scope 3 emissions as part of that? And I just want to flag that one of the areas that is most ripe for greenwashing is the announcement of targets and transition plans without any underlying information. That is not just greenwashing; that is outright fraud. And to the extent that a company makes those statements and, therefore, puts itself on the hook under the existing rules to say, well, yes, we are actually monitoring the things, our goals that we have announced that this is the progress that we are making, these are the steps that we are taking, I think that is exactly the information investors need to distinguish true and meaningful disclosures from fraud. Ms. Waters. Thank you. As you mentioned in your testimony, the final rule also limits the attestation requirements for Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, and, in some cases, shields attestation providers from liability. Can you share your thoughts on why this information is important to investors? Ms. Fisch. Auditing, attestation, all of that increases the reliability of information, and auditing has been part of financial statement disclosure for a long time. Issuers are voluntarily, in many cases, providing that same measure of reliability to their greenhouse gas emissions disclosures and to their other climate-related disclosures. And what the SEC is saying is, look, this is something that adds a tremendous amount to the reliability of this information. This is something that we should facilitate. At the same time, auditing services are viewed as costly, particularly for smaller firms, so what the SEC has implemented is a graduated level of disclosure with different timelines and different levels of assurance, depending on the size of the company. So it is very responsive, I think, to both investor and issuer needs. Ms. Waters. I want to thank you very much, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. Wagner. The gentlewoman yields back. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Sessions, for 5 minutes. Mr. Sessions. Madam Chairwoman, thank you very much. This is an interesting discussion today. Mr. Wright, I am going to probably aim some questions directly at you. I think it is better to tell you ahead of time rather than repeating the question. When this 886-page rule was issued, the SEC estimated that the rule would increase typical costs of a public company by 21 percent. Today, I looked at the website for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and their website, at the very top, has across it, ``Supporting small business,'' and below that, ``We inform and protect investors. We facilitate capital formation. We provide data.'' Well, they are providing data. I really wonder how this obvious 3-to-2 vote that took place seems like it is anti- investor and not helpful. Talk with me about your viewpoint about their mission statement, which I took as a mission statement, and about this as it relates to the typical cost of being a public company increased by 21 percent. Mr. Wright. Yes, I think that matters a lot in this country, and I think you have seen the trend. There are less than half as many public companies today as there were a few decades ago. This is unfortunate because it is through these public companies that investors, the smallest investors, every investor in this country can access private companies. There are other vehicles. Wealthy people can invest in those deals, but public companies are what is on offer and what is available for the investors across this country. So making it harder, more expensive, and riskier to be a public company, yes, reduces investor choices and options. It means larger amounts of resources are spent, in this case, gathering guesstimates that are then assembled, my bigger worry, and then, litigation over the guesstimates. I don't see that as productive. I think the SEC plays a critical role. We need oversight, we need a level playing field, we need to get out fraud, we need to build confidence in our marketplaces, so I think the SEC plays a critical role. But when it strays way outside of its lane, I struggle to find anything positive that could come from that. Mr. Sessions. Mr. Wright, I agree with you. I spent 16 years in a public company, and moved 8 times with them. It was a small company called AT&T, and our job as the management was to encourage not only the formation of capital, but to also encourage the supporting of small business. We took that as the way that we would grow our value, not just to the shareholder, but to the marketplace. Why would someone allow this to be up there that obviously is questionable? How would they justify this? I will ask anyone on the panel. Supporting small business, we voted for what would be, for a typical company, a 21-percent increase in costs. Can anybody on the panel offer some insight into that? Ms. Fisch. I would just note for the Congressman that the rules broadly exempt smaller reporting companies and emerging growth companies from virtually all of the reporting requirements, which is consistent with the SEC's longstanding practice of reducing---- Mr. Sessions. Thanks. The gentlewoman has been around long enough where she knows that if the big people, the big companies, if they suffer a 21-percent increase in cost, that means that it finds its way down to smaller companies. That was the one thing that you learned in Chamber of Commerce 101. You get a big company, and there are lots of small businesses that feed off of it. So, what I heard you say is we are only diminishing the value of the big companies, no process. We can definitely say we are for small business. I disagree. Madam Chairwoman, I yield back. Mrs. Wagner. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Cleaver, for 5 minutes. Mr. Cleaver. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and I thank all of you for giving us your time. Mr. Wright, this is no, ``gotcha,'' kind of question that leads to some kind of nasty comment from me. It is not. But I would like for you to tell me whether or not you believe that the SEC should still be in existence. Go ahead? Mr. Wright. Okay. I think I said in my opening statement that the SEC plays a critical role, and I am a strong believer in it. I have had only a constructive and positive working relationship with it for years. Mr. Cleaver. Okay. Yes. As you know, the SEC came into existence in the aftermath of the 1929 collapse, so it has been in existence for over 70 years, and from time to time, the risks have changed, but the SEC's role has remained the same. Do you agree with that? Mr. Wright. I think the implementation of that role has evolved as finance has evolved and as counting has evolved, and all of that. But to protect against fraud and make sure that people can trust the numbers from public companies, I think that mission has remained the same. Mr. Cleaver. Yes. Sometimes, it seems as if the opponents are actually beating up on the EPA as opposed to the SEC. Mr. Wright. Well, the EPA is an environmental regulator. Mr. Cleaver. Yes. Mr. Wright. Yes, that is the question. We have an environmental regulator that is also very rigorous in doing its job. Why do we want a financial regulator to become an environmental regulator? Mr. Cleaver. As I said earlier, the SEC's role has remained the same. Does this rule require companies to reduce emissions or make any kind of changes to address the risks identified? Mr. Wright. It certainly makes us change what people in our company do, because now we are going to have to spend a lot of time again gathering data that we can't gather, precisely. I can't emphasize that point enough. And the biggest issue for us, I believe, is this, ``transition risk,'' which is really regulatory risk from the government. So, does anyone know what the government is going to do in the future? I don't know how to speak thoughtfully or act thoughtfully on that risk. Mr. Cleaver. I respect the chairman's comments at the beginning. He said, we believe in science, and I seriously and honestly respect that because I think we are probably beyond it. But your comments that the globe is slowly warming and sea levels are gradually rising and have been doing that for over 150 years, and in the second half of this same period, you say that since the end of World War II, human burning of fossil fuels has increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by 50 percent. That's from your YouTube video, let's be honest. And if I listen to that, it is almost like you don't believe that climate change is real because you said you did, but then when I read this, you are essentially saying, no, it doesn't, that the scientists are wrong. Mr. Wright. Not at all. I think the video and the report that I am reporting the public data on temperature, on sea level lies on extreme weather, I am trying to put the public data that we understand about climate change in a more- digestible format so people can understand it. We don't know the future, but people can understand at least the history of what is going on with climate change because you have to weigh the tradeoffs there, the importance of energy. Mr. Cleaver. Yes. My time is running out. Explain this. You say, ``Any negative impacts from climate change were clearly overwhelmed by the benefits of increasing energy consumption.'' Can you add anything to that and clarify it even more? Mr. Wright. Yes, you bet. The arrival of hydrocarbons as meaningful energy sources, maybe a little more than 100 years', 150 years' global life expectancy, has more than doubled. The number of people living in extreme poverty has gone from 90 percent of humanity to less than 9 percent today. It is not zero yet, but the 20th Century is the greatest century of progress in human history. Mr. Cleaver. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. Thank you, Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright. Thank you, Congressman. Mrs. Wagner. The gentleman's time has expired. The Chair now recognizes herself for 5 minutes. Mr. Roisman, the climate rule initially included Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions data, which would have forced Missouri's farmers to track all emissions being produced by their crops and livestock, an extremely time-consuming, costly, and sometimes impossible task. Although it was removed from the final rule, I still have serious concerns regarding the future of Scope 3 disclosures. Can you explain what the SEC could have done if it wanted to fully prevent companies from making Scope 3 emissions disclosures? For example, could the SEC have considered preempting compliance with other jurisdictions, such as California, that require Scope 3 disclosures? Mr. Roisman. Yes, that would have been one way to do it. Additionally, I think they could have made an explicit statement in the rules saying we are not requiring any Scope 3 disclosure requirements. And I think one of the concerns people have is, as you heard from Mr. Stebbins and myself---- Mrs. Wagner. Yes. Mr. Roisman. ----is that a lot of us will be counseling companies that they will have to seriously consider whether they have to provide Scope 3 emissions, and, again, that is up and down the value chain. So, many people who wouldn't have thought that they had had to track any of this information are going to be getting calls from public companies saying, we need to find this out in order for us to comply. Mrs. Wagner. Can you explain why the uncertainty surrounding the future of Scope 3 emissions disclosures is troubling, outside of your current remarks? Mr. Roisman. I do think the SEC goes to great lengths in the release to talk about the difficulty of actually tracking, assessing, and cataloging all of this information. I think Mr. Wright did a very good job just talking about the difficulty of Scopes 1 and 2. And I think the problem is when things are put into an SEC filing, they come with a lot of liability and responsibility, including, oftentimes, having to sign your name on certain disclosure requirements and being subject to plenty of lawsuits. So, when you have sort of a measurement that is still not that well known or able to be quantified with precision, there is a lot of concern for companies on signing on the dotted line. Mrs. Wagner. Thank you. Mr. Wright, the SEC's decision to remove mandatory Scope 3 emissions disclosures gave many the impression that private companies are no longer affected by the rule. We know that is not true. Mr. Wright, can you tell us about how private companies, like Nomad, your co-petitioner in this lawsuit, are affected by the climate rule? Mr. Wright. Yes. I have been a lifelong technology innovator, and that is what Liberty Energy does. We invest in small companies that have exciting technologies that we think can make the energy system better. Part of it is reducing emissions or lowering pollution or lowering costs. We are passionate about all of these things, but Nomad is one example--I could give others--of private companies we have invested in that now we have some control rights, so they fall into our greater accounting. Now, they have to tally their emissions and we have to sign in a test that those are the best guesstimates, or whatever term we are going to use for that, I don't know. But yes, absolutely, big companies partner with small companies all the time. Mrs. Wagner. Professor White, Commissioner Peirce stated in her dissent that, ``The Commission performs impressive math- crobatics to slash the anticipated cost of the rule by 90 percent.'' Can you explain what costs the SEC left out of its analysis to artificially lower the anticipated costs? Mr. White. Yes, thank you. The statistic that Commissioner Peirce was referring to was the cumulative external burdens under the Paperwork Reduction Act, and it was specifically on Forms S-1 for registrations and the annual reports on 10-Ks. So, the cost estimate was reduced from $6.4 billion to only $600 million. Mrs. Wagner. $6.4 billion to what? Mr. White. To $600 million. Mrs. Wagner. So, that is the math-crobatics that Commissioner Peirce is talking about. Unbelievable. Carry on, please. Mr. White. Correct. And there was no detail provided around the Paperwork Reduction Act as to where that came from. Now, surely, some of this would apply to the removal of Scope 3 emissions, but it is hard to imagine how that cost goes down by more than 90 percent, and it should certainly be explained. I tried to reproduce this in my testimony and was also confused. Mrs. Wagner. Right. I appreciate that. I have some additional questions that I will submit for the record. I appreciate all of your testimony. My time has expired. And I now recognize the gentlewoman from Ohio, Mrs. Beatty, for 5 minutes. Mrs. Beatty. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and thank you to the ranking member and to all of our witnesses here, thank you for all your comments, and your expertise that you have provided today. And certainly, we have heard a lot today, and frankly, over the last couple of years since this rule was first proposed, it seems like we have heard all about how disastrous and burdensome climate exposure would be, so let me just interject this. Climate should not be a political issue. It is a reality. We must face it head on rather than burying our heads in the sand, pretending that it does not exist or complaining that it would be too burdensome to address it. Investors have been asking for more disclosure. Fifty percent of the voters oppose Congress limiting their access to corporate business records, and as you mentioned, Professor Fisch, climate is just one small piece of what investors have been asking for. We should not be in the business of banning what American consumers and investors want just because it doesn't serve our political agenda. Consumers, everyday Americans are dealing with the effects of climate change daily. They are seeing insurance company withdrawals, spikes in premiums, and other limitations on coverage as a direct result of climate change. Instead of coming to their aid, we are still bickering about whether or not a problem exists. America knows a problem exists. Meanwhile, other countries around the world are filling the vacuum, and taking the lead while we sit back and, in my opinion, maybe even wasting our time. The SEC made significant changes. And I think it is worth noting that the SEC made significant changes to the final rule in response to feedback from businesses and other shareholders who submitted comments. They have bent over backwards, in my opinion, to address everyone's concerns while still establishing a comprehensive disclosure framework that meets investors' demands. Now, I know you have read all the reviews, and certainly, to one of our witnesses, as a former Acting Chair, I am sure you have gone through all of those thousands of thousands of comments you get. But to my Republican colleagues, it appears that it is still not enough. Stonewalling and refusing to compromise, to find workable solutions, I don't believe is any way to go. But now, in my few minutes left, let me go to you, Professor Fisch. Other countries are way ahead of the United States when it comes to sustainable finance and climate risk. For example, I have been advised that the European Union has a comprehensive climate disclosure regime that is already in effect. What would be the benefits of the SEC harmonizing its climate risk disclosure rules with other countries' disclosure standards? Ms. Fisch. I think there would be tremendous benefits. Number one, a company wouldn't have to be subjected to the uncertainty of which regulatory regime they are subject to. Number two, the company could have standardized one set of disclosures, one set of auditors, to the extent auditing is required, one set of advisors to help them frame the disclosures to comply. That would greatly reduce the costs, and that would simplify not just the cost for issuers, but it would also simplify the cost for investors. We have a global marketplace, not just capital markets, but businesses, right? So, harmonization would be a tremendous step. My view is, that is something the SEC should be considering going forward, the extent to which substituted compliance might be a possibility, the extent to which negotiation as opposed to separate rulemaking might provide some sort of global standard. Mrs. Beatty. Okay. And quickly, I understand that the SEC made significant changes to the final rule. And by the way, there was a female who also supported that, to my colleague who wanted to interject about another female, that the SEC made significant changes to the final rule in response to the comments on the original. How did the SEC make the final requirements less burdensome? And I have about 20 seconds. Ms. Fisch. As a lot of this discussion has focused on, the SEC reduced the requirement for carbon emission disclosures, eliminated the requirement that Scope 3 emissions be disclosed, even in situations in which they are material. The SEC extended the implementation period. The SEC reduced the number of disclosures that have to be made as part of the financial statements. The SEC reduced the oversight responsibilities of auditors. That is just a sample. Mrs. Beatty. Thank you. Mr. Barr. . The gentlelady's time has expired. The Chair now recognizes himself for 5 minutes. As the witnesses well know, the Securities and Exchange Commission has a three-part statutory mission: protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation. Mr. Wright, on the issue of protecting investors, will the additional reporting costs and litigation risk that you have testified would result from this rule enhance or diminish the financial performance of your company and other similarly- situated energy firms? Mr. Wright. Diminish. Mr. Barr. And would that then protect or harm your shareholders? Mr. Wright. Harm. Mr. Barr. Strike one. On the second part of the mission, to maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, Mr. Wright, what impact would the rule have on U.S. energy markets? Mr. Wright. I think on the margin, you would see less oil and gas production in the United States, but no change in demand, so necessarily more imports and almost certainly from countries with higher greenhouse gas emissions from their productions. Mr. Barr. So, it would have an impact on the competitiveness of U.S. energy markets relative to foreign energy producers? Mr. Wright. Correct. Mr. Barr. So, maintaining efficient markets, strike two. And third, to facilitate capital formation. Mr. Wright, will the rule help your company access capital? Would it facilitate capital formation in the energy sector? Mr. Wright. No. Mr. Barr. Strike three. It doesn't look like the SEC is fulfilling its statutory mission here. Mr. Roisman, Professor Fisch testified that the rule will increase the standardization and comparability of key climate- related disclosures. In fact, Chair Gensler makes the argument that we need this rule for comparability and consistency. You testified, however, that you doubt that the SEC has achieved this goal in the final rule. Why are you right, and why is Professor Fisch wrong? Mr. Roisman. I don't want to be counter to Professor Fisch. My perspective is that if you are going to have a standard line-item disclosure, everyone is going to do it. The problem lies in the fact that a lot of these things are based on different assumptions. Each company is going to have to make tailor-made assumptions to itself and to its business, and because of that, it is really not going to be apples to apples. Mr. Barr. Let's settle this debate a little bit more, with all respect to Professor Fisch. Public companies, Mr. Roisman, will be required to disclose in the final rule information related to the financial statement effects of, ``severe weather events and other natural conditions.'' Mr. Roisman, in terms of severe weather events and other natural conditions, that appears in the final rule 205 times, and 158 times, respectively. Are either of these terms defined anywhere in the rule? Mr. Roisman. Natural conditions are certainly not. Severe weather events, you get a little bit of indication that might be tornadoes, earthquakes. I think what I would like to focus on is your point about the accounting treatment which is a severe weather event for a company, is very different based on where it is business is. Whether it is in Kentucky or in Poland or in Belize, companies are going to need to do different policies and procedures to track all of this information in different countries, in different areas. And all of this information needs to be tracked because there is a very, very low de minimis amount that if you hit it, you have to disclose, so this is going to be a very costly and, frankly, onerous burden. Mr. Barr. It doesn't sound like this will enhance comparability whatsoever. Professor Fisch also said that the rule only applies to large companies or large accelerated filers. Mr. Roisman, do you want to address this claim and the rules application to smaller public companies? Mr. Roisman. What I think maybe Professor Fisch was alluding to is the Scope 1 and 2 disclosure requirements, but small companies will be responsible for the regulation S-K disclosures as well as the S-X, which is the accounting information that is going to be in the audited financial statements. So, that is for all companies. Mr. Barr. Yes, all companies, exactly. All public companies are impacted by this rule. Professor White, final question to you. This issue of materiality, I think, is something that we talk about a lot. And Professor Fisch says that the SEC's rule, no problems here, because it limits disclosures to information that has materially impacted an issuer. Professor White, do all investors benefit when the SEC mandates disclosures that only a specific group of investors who concentrate on a single risk factor deem to be material? Mr. White. No, and there are a lot of special interest groups that are interested in information, that are not necessarily representative of all investors, so that what might be material to one investor might not be material to the reasonable or the average investor. Mr. Barr. Thank you. I think that is the key. Materiality needs to be about materiality of all investors, the reasonable investor, not just climate alarmists. With that, I yield back. The gentleman from California, Mr. Vargas, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Vargas. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I thank the ranking member, and, again, I want to thank all the witnesses here today. I appreciate your testimonies. I know that it is tough to leave work and come here and testify, and I appreciate that very much. I do always ask how many of the witnesses, and I do this every time--how many of you believe in climate change, that climate change is real? If you could please raise your hand. If you don't believe, you don't need to raise your hand. It is the same question. I want to be fair. How many people believe that climate change is real? If you could just please raise your hands. It is a bad question. Okay. So, the question is bad. I am going to go on to my next question because you seem to think that is a bad question. I heard this today, and I hear it all the time, ``the unaccountable bureaucrats versus elected officials,'' that somehow the elected officials have this special knowledge. Well, I have been an elected official for a long time, and I know a lot of elected officials. I trust the bureaucrats a lot more than I trust the elected officials because the bureaucrats oftentimes have special knowledge, especially in the field in which they are making decisions. It is interesting. We have an elected official here who looks up into the heavens and sees the total eclipse and thinks it is the eschaton, that somehow God is talking to us, and it is the end of times, that the rapture is about here. Look at the science. Well, eclipses happen all the time--numerically, we figure these things out--and so do earthquakes. It is not the foretold eschaton or the rapture. It is just science in the earth. And that is why I don't buy this whole notion that somehow these bureaucrats don't know what they are talking about. Oftentimes, it is really politicians who don't, but anyway, that is from experience, unfortunately, my own, too. I will throw myself into that group. But all that being said, I do want to ask this. Professor Fisch, you were given strike one, strike two, and strike three. You didn't even get up to bat. I think that is a little unfair. So, I want to give you the chance to answer those questions before you strike out. Again, in your view, how is the rule consistent with the SEC's three-part mission to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation? You get up to bat this time--go ahead--before you strike out. Ms. Fisch. Thank you. As my written testimony details, this is information that investors have been demanding. This is a small tip of the information that investors have been demanding with respect to business risks, and sustainability challenges for companies, and it responds to the longstanding information asymmetry. Companies have this information, investors don't, and reducing that information asymmetry is what produces more- efficient markets so that investors can choose the companies in which they want to invest. They can evaluate whether a business plan is resilient for the future and they can evaluate the quality of management. And something we haven't really focused on today is, investors do that not just by buying and selling securities; they also do that through exercising their governance rights. And part of the SEC's mandate is to provide meaningful disclosure so that investors can vote, so that they can vote to elect directors who are monitoring material risks, so that they can vote for or against shareholder proposals based on how well they think the company is doing. And how does that facilitate capital formation? Obviously, if you have strong quality markets, that is going to make it easier for companies to raise capital, and that is going to tailor the costs of capital to a company's business plan. And we see that in the fact that so many companies come to the U.S. capital markets to raise capital. Mr. Vargas. Professor, I don't give you a homerun, but a solid triple, standard triple. I think you did a good job there. Now, I do want to say this. You talked about the corporations. A lot of these corporations do, in fact, collect this information, as you said, because they think it is real. And you might not think it is a good question, but the reality is that they do compile this information. It is important, and climate change is happening, no matter what people think. I am from San Diego, and you don't think of floods in San Diego, but we just had a gigantic flood in San Diego, a thousand-year event, and it flooded a good portion of San Diego, and we had all of these problems, something we normally don't get. You can't buy insurance in large parts of California because of climate change. This stuff is real. Investors know it, companies know it, the information is there, they should disclose it, and that is what this rule attempts to do. I also wish they would have gone a little further with Scope 3, but I understand that at the moment, maybe it is not the right time to do it, but it has to go there at some point. And, again, I appreciate all of you being here, and, again, I thank the Chair. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Rose. . The gentleman yields back. The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Williams, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Williams of Texas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The SEC's misguided climate crusade has clearly overstepped their statutory authority by requiring excessive costly and detailed climate-related regulations. Instead of meeting the needs of all investors, the SEC has shifted towards pandering towards progressive shareholders and green activists. This is a dangerous path to go down. It will have negative consequences for all investors. In the 886-page climate rule, the compliance cost has skyrocketed for public companies which must comb through the burdensome rule to ensure they are meeting all the requirements. The SEC must return to their core mission and protect the interests of all investors and public companies, not just those who are fixated on politicizing boardrooms and our capital markets. Professor White, could you elaborate on how this climate rule will increase costs and burdensome compliance requirements for public companies? And I have a follow-up for you. Mr. White. Certainly, the direct cost of the disclosure, as the SEC has estimated, is going to increase costs by upwards of 20 percent, which is one of the biggest increases, at least that I am familiar with, in recent times. It is also going to have indirect costs or spillover costs in the sense that is going to, as Mr. Wright said, raise legal liability, and it could have a dampening effect on capital formation. So, those together are an enormous cost. Mr. Williams of Texas. I have a question for you, then. This climate rule will increase costs for public companies, we have said that, but many of these costs will also prove to be unbearable for small insurers or issuers, and another concern of mine is how this rule will affect small companies' ability to compete on a global stage. Specifically, that the increased reporting requirements and compliance costs will serve as a barrier to entry into global markets for smaller companies. The SEC's purpose is to allow American businesses to compete, not to try and tie them down with excessive compliance costs and burdensome regulations, which seems to be what we are going through with this Administration. One more time, Professor White, what impacts will these costs have on American competitiveness, especially regarding the ability of smaller companies to compete globally? Mr. White. Regulations always have a disproportionate or outsized effect on small companies, so these regulations I would expect to be more impactful to small companies. We might see fewer IPOs, we might see companies staying private longer, and we might see companies moving to other jurisdictions, which impacts us in terms of losing people, losing tax revenues. And your notion of creating an impediment, I like to view these types of regulations as being like a brick: While one rule might be a small block, eventually you have built a barrier to going public, and once that barrier is formed, we lose competitiveness on a global stage. Mr. Williams of Texas. Thank you. This climate rule will open various challenges for companies which are already public or for companies which are looking to go public. This rule is a significant barrier to entry and will surely dissuade companies from undertaking the necessary steps to go public in fear of the compliance burdens and costs to which they will be subject. And companies will face other challenges, like increased risk of litigation and the complexities and the challenges that will come with it. Because of this rule and the consequences it will bring, companies will have to shift their resources towards compliance and will have to sacrifice key services enjoyed by their shareholders or they will refuse to go public in order to protect themselves from needless attacks thrown at them by the SEC. Mr. Stebbins, can you expand on how this misguided and harmful rule will deter companies from going public? It's pretty simple. Mr. Stebbins. I think rules aren't passed in a vacuum, and I think you have to look at what has happened in the last few years in general, and this isn't the only rule that has been passed, right? It is very hard to be a public company right now, and I think all of these rules incrementally make it harder, including this one. Mr. Williams of Texas. Any time you hire these compliance officers, it takes away from the core mission bottom line, right? Mr. Stebbins. Say that again, sir. I'm sorry? Mr. Williams of Texas. I said compliance officers versus salesmen, that tells you the difference right there, right? Mr. Stebbins. There are certainly a lot of costs built in and there are a lot of costs built into this release-- attorneys, accountants, consultants, et cetera. Mr. Williams of Texas. Okay. Thank you for that, and I yield back. Mr. Rose. The gentleman yields back. The gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Casten, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Casten. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Professor Fisch, I would like to start with you. My colleagues have talked a lot about the disclosure requirements for emissions. And just to confirm, a lot of this rule is about disclosing your exposure to climate change, not just your contribution to climate change, right? Ms. Fisch. Yes, that is correct. Mr. Casten. Okay. And right now, if I understand it, I think I have seen numbers that the average public company spends $500,000 per year complying with voluntary disclosure requirements? Ms. Fisch. That is one of the reasons that estimating the cost of compliance is so difficult because, of course, the SEC doesn't have access to the costs that each company spends on voluntary disclosure. Mr. Casten. Yes. So, if I am an investor or maybe if you are an investor, would you like to know the risks your portfolio is exposed to and which companies in your portfolio are contributing to that risk? Isn't that kind of the basis of being an informed investor? Ms. Fisch. Absolutely. I would want to know the risks, and I would like to know what the management is doing to respond. Mr. Casten. I realize I am preaching to the choir here, but our chairman started this by saying that the Democrats were going to say we are science deniers because we don't want to talk about materiality. This is so deeply right within the SEC's wheelhouse to understand risk, right? But by the way, the SEC does not have an obligation to ignore science, right? Ms. Fisch. That is right, yes. Mr. Casten. The last time I checked, Elizabeth Holmes committed financial fraud by misrepresenting medical science. FTX committed financial fraud by misrepresenting math, which is a science. There have long been people who have come to Congress and said, I need to misrepresent science. Here is one. James Black, in 1977, said that doubling CO2 gases in the atmosphere would increase global temperatures by 2 or 3 degrees, and that man has a time window of 5 to 10 years before the need for hard decisions regarding changes in energy strategies might become critical. James Black was a senior scientist at ExxonMobil. He said that privately in 1977. He didn't say that publicly because that would have hurt their share price. Don't ignore science, folks. With that, I turn to you, Mr. Wright. In January 2023, you said, in a YouTube video, ``We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, or floods, despite endless fear-mongering media, politicians, and activists.'' In the same video, you said, ``There is no climate crisis. We are not in the midst of an energy transition either. Humans and complex life are simply impossible without carbon dioxide. The idea of carbon pollution is outrageous.'' Do you agree that you said all of those things? Mr. Wright. Absolutely. Mr. Casten. Okay. It is all bullshit. Mr. Wright. Which was wrong? Which one of those was wrong? Mr. Casten. Reclaiming my time, sir. The fact that you said that--I could go through countless Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that make it very clear to the contrary. I could go through countless reports from our own financial regulators that there are risks. We could talk about the number of places in the world where the wet bulb temperature now regularly exceeds 35 degrees Celsius, 95F, which is beyond the ability of humans to live for more than 6 hours at a time in India, and Bangladesh, maybe not in your air-conditioned office, but this stuff is real. And I am not going to get into an argument with you, because ultimately, you don't matter. You are an interchangeable person who comes here and finds it useful to misrepresent science in order to create short-term value for your shareholders. There are thousands of people like you. You are going to be forgotten years from now. Maybe, your grandchildren will be embarrassed. I don't know, but what I know right now is that we have to act on this stuff. We are sitting here in a moment where we know these changes are happening. And I am sympathetic with you in the narrow sense, Mr. Wright, that in the last 10 years, oil demand in the United States has not moved, coal demand is down 40 percent, and natural gas demand has decoupled from GDP growth, and that is because renewables are surging. It is because EVs are surging. The markets are demanding things that you are not providing. Capitalism is hard, right? And when capitalism is hard, the worst thing in your world is that you might actually have informed investors. There is a reason why the whole oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) sector is, on a good day, lucky to get a 10 times earnings multiple, and the clean energy sector is running at 20, 30 times multiple. They are getting cheaper access to capital. You all are building an industry to export, to sell your product to places where people don't have access to capital. Maybe, you don't care. Our job here is not to protect Liberty Energy investors. It is to protect markets. It is to protect all investors. It is to make sure that capitalism works. And I hope that someday that is not partisan, even if it is scientifically true. I yield back. Mr. Rose. The gentleman yields back. The Chair would just remind all of our Members to display proper decorum. Mr. Wright, we thank you for being with us as a witness today. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Loudermilk, for 5 minutes. Mr. Loudermilk. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Wright, I will start with you. It is amazing to me how some people here in this body are very selective with the science that they want to accept, right? We were wanting to follow the science with COVID. There is gender identity. It seems that they want to selectively follow science. You were cut off, I think rudely. I wanted to give you an opportunity to respond to Mr. Casten, but also to Mr. Vargas, who asked the question about whether or not you believe in climate change, and you responded that that wasn't a fair question. So, I want to give you a few moments to respond to both of them. Mr. Wright. Thank you, Congressman. Look, climate change and energy are just simply too important to get wrong, to make bombastic, non-fact-based statements, which is why I say it is not about belief, it has become religion. That is very unfortunate. This is a science-based technical topic. We should study climate change, understand the risks there, understand the downsides, understand the upsides, and then, look at our energy system. And ultimately, it is about what is the best set of tradeoffs to make there, and what the world has done in the last 2 decades. It has actually been a pretty poor calculus in that. We have spent somewhere between $4 trillion and $10 trillion, depending on how you want to count it, dominantly for wind and solar, which just crossed 2 percent of global energy, and everywhere they have large penetration, you have more- expensive electricity and less-stable grids. They are not threats to oil and gas. I feel zero threat whatsoever. I went to college to work on fusion energy at MIT. I worked on solar energy at UC Berkeley. I have worked on geothermal energy for 30 years. I am not some partisan defending the oil and gas industry; I am just a believer in the fact that energy matters. We still have 2 billion people cooking their daily meals, burning wood, dung, and agricultural waste, with about 3 million deaths a year from that, and we are going to stand in the way of them getting propane so they can have clean, long, healthy lives like us? That is just crazy, and everything I said in that video is true, and is actually in the IPCC reports. People talk about them or the summary from policymakers, so I am very careful about that. This book that I think I sent to every member, including Representative Casten, has all of this data. It is all referenced. This isn't made up. This isn't denying from my industry. This is just being sober and honest about energy and climate change. Mr. Loudermilk. I appreciate that, and it is political science here. The science that is accepted is based on what is good in popular politics is what you find here in this building. Mr. Wright, while I have you, quickly, I understand your company, Liberty Energy, successfully sued the SEC to stay the rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Then, after the stay was lifted, just last week, the SEC decided to voluntarily stay the rule on its own. Did the SEC's decision to change course come as a surprise to you? Mr. Wright. I am not good at predicting those things, but I guess it was a pleasant surprise. Mr. Loudermilk. What was your reaction to the news based on the SEC's tone, when just a few weeks earlier, they were in court arguing against Liberty Energy's push to stay the rule? Mr. Wright. Yes. Again, I can't handicap that. I think the stay is a good thing. This issue should be litigated. We should decide what the right answer is, and we will all live by the answer that comes down. Mr. Loudermilk. Okay. Mr. Roisman, I am concerned that the SEC is misleading the public about the impetus for their climate rule. The Commission has repeatedly asserted that the final rule's climate disclosures are a direct response to investor demand, but it is unclear who those investors even are and how useful the information required by the rule would be when making investment decisions. Is it possible the SEC is responding to some other pressure, such as pressure from activist groups to finalize the climate disclosure rule? Mr. Roisman. I think this was certainly a concern raised by the two dissenting Commissioners about this being more political in nature than substantive. Now, I think it should be noted that there are investors who want this, and there are investors who don't want this. The test has always been the SEC is trying to provide information so people can make an informed investment decision, and that usually is tied to financial returns. One of the things that the dissenting Commissioners talked about was that a lot of the proponents of the rule may have sort of a focus on nonfinancial or pecuniary returns, and that is perfectly fine, but that is not historically what the SEC does in terms of mandating disclosure. Mr. Loudermilk. Quickly, can you explain the difference between having the companies file these disclosures that they were forced to do as opposed to furnishing them, and why that difference matters? Mr. Roisman. The difference matters in terms of liability risk, in terms of plaintiff lawsuits and other litigations there. Mr. Loudermilk. Okay. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Rose. The gentleman yields back. The gentlewoman from Massachusetts, Ms. Pressley, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. Pressley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Listening to my colleagues across the aisle as they talk about the recent climate disclosure rule, the American people might be inclined to believe that the SEC had no basis for taking on this issue and that there is no climate emergency. I think that is what some people might refer to as fake news, when, in fact, at the last hearing on providing transparency for investors by requiring climate disclosure, I was encouraged to hear SEC Chair Gensler confirm on the record that investors responded favorably to the proposed rule as it was previously designed. So, the SEC understands that we must take action to protect our financial system. That is why I am disappointed that the final rule is significantly weaker. It fails to fully deliver the informational Scope 3 emissions that investors want, and this has consequences for millions of workers and families, whether it is personal retirement savings or college savings for a child. Investments are at greater risk due to this weakened rule. Ninety-seven percent of investor comments were in favor of the proposed rule. This supported the inclusion of Scope 3. Ms. Fisch, can you explain how folks would benefit from data on Scope 3 emissions from U.S. companies? Ms. Fisch. Thank you. Yes, Scope 3 emissions allow a company to assess what risks am I exposed to based on the regulation, the demands, the environmental impact on my customers, on my suppliers, on my employees, on the world in which I operate. So for example, to the extent that a company's supply chain is vulnerable, that is a material business risk, right? It doesn't matter how you feel about climate change. That is something that a company has to plan for. That is something that a company has to take into account. For example, we get our water from a particular supplier, and that water supply is limited, is threatened. This might be a good time to diversify. So, investors need to understand those kinds of questions as well as the extent to which management is informing itself and making the hard choices. And the hard choices may or may not be to take a particular climate-oriented approach, but it is knowing the information and guiding your company so it is going to be sustainable in the future. Ms. Pressley. Thank you. Ms. Fisch, there are trillions of dollars implicated by the SEC Climate Disclosure Rule, but my Republican colleagues want it to be even weaker. Do you agree that it should be a strong rule that helps our economy? Ms. Fisch. I do believe it should be a strong rule. And I have to say, I am persuaded by some of Mr. Roisman's questions that to the extent the SEC has limited some of the disclosures, that does reduce information in the market, and that does reduce comparability. So a stronger rule would have, I think, been even better tailored to the SEC's goals of protecting the markets and investors. Ms. Pressley. Very good. I am calling on the SEC to reconsider its position to include climate risk disclosure on Scope 3 emissions to protect investors and to safeguard our financial system. This is not the time to backtrack and to weaken regulations. This is the time to strengthen them. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Rose. The gentlelady yields back. I now recognize myself for 5 minutes, and I will begin by thanking Chairman McHenry and Ranking Member Waters for holding this hearing, and a particular thank you to our witnesses today. I know you volunteer your time to do this, and we appreciate you sharing your expertise, and we hope that you regard this as a productive and enjoyable enterprise. Three weeks ago, our Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee visited Tennessee's 6th District, my district, to speak with regulatory victims of this rule. After that hearing, I was further determined to speak out against this rule and expose what I believe is Chair Gensler's detrimental conduct. Mr. Wright, part of this awful rule, in my estimation, is the inclusion of Scope 2 disclosure requirements. This requirement would, of course, mean that publicly-traded companies will have to disclose how much greenhouse gas is generated through their electricity usage. The execution of this will be especially problematic for publicly-traded companies in Tennessee, and in my district, Tennessee's 6th. In Tennessee, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) generates electricity and sells it to utility companies which then distribute the electricity to these publicly-traded companies. This rule will mean that TVA must work with the distributors to ensure that companies are provided with accurate Scope 2 figures. From your company's perspective, can you talk about the level of difficulty in producing these Scope 2 disclosure reports and calculating the costs of energy generation? Mr. Wright. Yes. I wish I knew a more accurate answer to that. But we do business in 12 States, in all different rural areas, from one-off jobs out in Utah where there is no oil and gas where we are doing work for geothermal, so it is all over the place. So yes, to think everywhere we source electricity from or heat or cooling or other energy sources, that will be very tricky to do, and, of course, we will just be getting someone else's guesstimates of the numbers for our data to add to our own guesstimates. Mr. Rose. Sure. And I would just say that the scope of this rule, in my view, is clearly intended to provide information for blame-and-shame exercises beyond the materiality requirements that have historically guided disclosure. And it strikes me that if this is material, then everything is material, and if everything is material, then nothing is informative for the investing public. Mr. White, as a professor at Vanderbilt University, my alma mater, you are likely aware that the State of Tennessee manages assets for public workers and retirees across the State. The managers of these funds are focused on maximizing returns, not social or political agendas. Is there any net financial benefit that public workers and retirees could expect to see in their assets or managed funds due to this rule? Mr. White. Thank you for the question. Certainly, pension funds and retirement funds have a fiduciary duty to their investors, and that is to maximize their returns so that they can use that money in retirement. The extent that the cost of this rule outweighs the benefit, would be detrimental to them. The SEC already has its 2010 climate guidance in terms of requiring material disclosures around climate. So, if that is material to registrants, they should already be disclosing it, which means that additional disclosure burdens would have limited benefits and thus impact returns negatively. Mr. Rose. Thank you. I appreciate that and agree with your observations. Mr. White, could the funds that they will have to allocate towards compliance be better spent towards growth, fueling stronger returns for Tennesseans? Mr. White. Yes, absolutely. In fact, I have a study with Professor Craig Lewis, also at Vanderbilt, that looks at the 2012 Jobs Act, and companies used compliance savings which exempted them from costly provisions like Sarbanes-Oxley. They used that money instead of compliance by investing in their science, so every dollar that goes to compliance is a dollar that you are not investing for growth and returns. And so, yes, it would impact them negatively. Mr. Rose. Thank you. Mr. Stebbins, as a lawyer myself, and an investor myself, I want to be extremely clear, and I know this point has been made. But are public companies under the current materiality doctrine already required to report every piece of material information? Mr. Stebbins. That has been made very clear, I think, in the 2010 guidance, and subsequently in many later statements from the SEC, whomever has been running the SEC at the time, Chairman Clayton, or Bill Hinman, the Corporation Finance Division Director. So yes, it is extremely clear. Mr. Rose. Thank you. I appreciate that. I see my time is about to expire, so I yield back. And I recognize the gentleman from Nevada, Mr. Horsford, for 5 minutes. Mr. Horsford. Thank you to the chairman, to the ranking member, and to our witnesses for your time and for being before us today to discuss yet another manufactured culture war that has nearly nothing to do with the critical issues facing our country's financial systems. Unfortunately, we are here relitigating the same arguments over an unrelatable SEC rulemaking when we should be working on the issues that actually matter to our constituents. The Majority seems wholly uninterested in tackling the hard questions that we face as a nation today. Anyone who has been to my district knows that the number-one issue we face is the high cost of housing. To show just how dire this crisis has become, I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a January article from the Las Vegas Review-Journal entitled, ``Las Vegas home prices going up 5 times faster than wages, report says.'' Mr. Meuser. . Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. Horsford. This article outlines the particularly painful point that, according to recent Zillow data, from 2011 to the end of 2022, home price growth in Southern Nevada has far outpaced wage growth in the same time frame. It is such a pressing crisis for folks in my State because Nevada led the country over that time frame with an astounding six-fold increase in the ratio of home prices to wages, six-fold over an 11-year period. However, this should surprise no one, given that Nevada is already short approximately 80,000 units of housing that is affordable, and the volume of home sales has bottomed out at its lowest since 2008. These are real challenges that demand real solutions, and yet, my colleagues across the aisle have none. The housing legislation that they have posted for our most recent markup would do nothing to address these skyrocketing costs, and one bill would actually make it easier for landlords to evict their tenants. Their lack of interest in finding answers to these questions is why we are holding hearing after hearing to debate the merits of climate change instead of debating the merits of the necessary fixes to the housing market that my colleagues and I have advanced. Everyday Nevadans are in the fight of their lives, and unfortunately, they are up against some of the wealthiest and most-sophisticated investors in the country. It is time for us to stand up for the people. I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a Nevada Independent article entitled, ``It's time to take back our housing from Wall Street.'' Mr. Meuser. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. Horsford. The reality for our communities is a stark one. As this article points out, displacement is the norm in our communities. North Las Vegas residents regularly confront exorbitant rates, soaring housing costs, tenant exploitation, and eventually, eviction notices. Last year, I had the opportunity to see firsthand just how destructive these abuses can be when I was able to attend an eviction proceeding at the North Las Vegas Justice Court on behalf of my constituents. Out-of-State corporate investors are preying on the most vulnerable among us, and we need broad Federal legislation to address the issue and hold these firms accountable for their unfair abuses that they impose upon our communities. But we can only do that, Mr. Chairman, if we hold meaningful hearings to debate the merits of potential solutions, potential solutions like my Housing Oversight and Mitigating Exploitation (Home) Act, which would empower HUD to curb the very worst of the predatory behaviors that we see in the housing market today. Don't take my word for it. Come to my district and hear for yourselves stories from people like Katrina Paul. Katrina has been working with her REALTOR to finally achieve the dream of homeownership. However, she has been thwarted at every turn. Katrina has made 18 offers on homes during the recent surge in Las Vegas' housing market, and she has been outbid on every single one. She has been outbid by cash buyer after cash buyer, and through no fault of her own, she is forced to continue to rent an apartment that is too small. Her only dream, like so many across this country, is the dream of finally owning her own home. This story is far too common across Southern Nevada, where hardworking people are stuck making rent payments each month when they should be investing in the equity that helps to build wealth for themselves and their family. So people like Katrina will continue to be forced to delay that dream and that wealth, if they are ever able to have it come true at all. Mr. Chairman, I just ask you, out of respect---- Mr. Meuser. The gentleman's time has expired. Mr. Horsford. ----for my constituents, to prioritize my legislation and that of my colleagues dealing with housing affordability, and let's address the crisis that is before our constituents now in this Congress. Mr. Meuser. The gentleman needs to respect the time. Mr. Horsford. I yield back. Mr. Meuser. The gentleman from South Carolina, Mr. Timmons, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Timmons. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to our witnesses for being here today to discuss the recently- finalized climate disclosure rule. Time and time again, the Biden Administration has leveraged so-called independent regulators to achieve political goals they can't accomplish through Congress. And SEC Chair Gary Gensler may just be President Biden's most-effective tool in this strategy, promulgating rules that turn our capital markets on their heads in order to promote inflation-driving Green New Deal policies, rather than reinforcing their fiduciary duty to create wealth for investors. It is quite evident that all investors are united by their shared concern for financial return and are divided on how important they consider non-economic factors such as climate change. By requiring extensive climate-related disclosures, the SEC has opened the door for activists to lobby for the mandatory disclosure of other non-economic information. There are a multitude of concerns with the SEC's recent efforts to influence the way company boards and management operate. For example, the recently-finalized cybersecurity rule requires detailed, potentially non-material risk management and governance disclosures to dictate the way companies should handle cyber risk. The climate rule goes even further, requiring management and boards to make complex judgments about climate risks, some of which are admittedly not material. Mr. Roisman, would you explain what problems arise when regulators impose overly-prescriptive requirements relating to board governance and risk management? Mr. Roisman. Thank you for the question. I think this sort of stems from the idea of, do you continue a principles-based disclosure regime where companies are in the best position to tell investors what they think is material, and then, when regulators, say, provide line-item disclosures about each one. The problem you alluded to, which I have heard before, is sometimes called the federalization of corporate governance, where, by requiring regulations to disclose things about boards and management, are you trying to push boards and management to act in a certain way? And with the cyber rule and the climate rule, in the proposal, there was this concept that you needed to disclose the expertise on the board with respect to cyber or to climate. Both were struck out of the final rule, but some of the comments that people received, or that the SEC received were, are you essentially telling us that we need to have a climate expert or a cyber expert on the board, because there are many reasons to be on a board. So I think the concern people have is, if you require some of these disclosures, is this in effect trying to effectuate change? And the SEC is a disclosure agency. It is not an agency that is supposed to dictate how companies act. Mr. Timmons. Sure. Thank you for that. Mr. Stebbins, in a paper entitled, ``The Economics of ESG Disclosure Regulation,'' your former colleague, Dr. Kothari, suggests that climate- related financial risks are not as significant as other risks such as interest rate risks, inflation risks, recession risks, and many others, where granular prescriptive disclosures are not mandated. Does the climate rule risk misleading investors into believing climate risks are more significant than other risks? Mr. Stebbins. I think that is a concern that has been raised--Commissioner Peirce raised it in her dissent. Commissioner Roisman, next to me, just mentioned that you are trying to push certain behaviors as opposed to just regulating by requiring disclosures of certain things. You are trying to push boards and companies to act in a certain way rather than just doing what they know, what they consider to be in the best interest of the shareholders, and they certainly know better than the regulatory agency. I think that would be the main concern with that. And also, I think Commissioner Peirce mentioned that it is climate. What is next, right? What is the next social issue? Mr. Timmons. I am going to follow up on that. Does this not disadvantage U.S. businesses in the global markets, because businesses in foreign countries, other than Europe, don't have these additional requirements, and they are focused on a return on the investment, not other variables that are not core to their business function. Is this going to create a challenge for U.S. businesses to compete in the global economy? Mr. Stebbins. I think unquestionably it does, yes. Mr. Timmons. I think that is a major problem, and my district has been the victim of Federal policy that has sent tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of jobs overseas. And we need to focus on competing in the global economy, and this Administration is on the wrong track. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Thank you. Mr. Meuser. The gentleman yields back. The gentlewoman from Texas, Ms. Garcia, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. Garcia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to all of the witnesses for being here today. Well, here we are again. I think this is the 6th hearing we have had on the SEC, and the 12th on climate change. I am hearing a lot of more of the same. As we continue to debate whether climate risk is a financial risk, the climate crisis continues to get worse and consumers are paying the price because it goes on and on. Families and hardworking Americans in my district are dealing with insurance company withdrawals, insurance cancellations, and premium spikes in Texas. In fact, Mr. Chairman, I was stunned during our 2-week break, because my own homeowner's insurance, which was about $9,500, is now $13,600. That is a huge spike. So, anybody who tells me that the weather does not impact climate change needs to come to Houston where we have suffered from hurricanes, flooding, storms--one last night--freezes. So, this whole notion that it isn't real, to me, it is just dumbfounding. In fact, even the recent fires in Texas cost the Rangers at least $102 million. Millions and millions of acres were on fire. Investors are clamoring for these climate disclosures. I have heard it. I know that people in my district, even though they are not investors, are clamoring for it. These disclosures not only promote better transparency to inform consumers and investors, but also help the industry track their environmental, social, and corporate governance goals. Professor Fisch, I keep hearing the sky is falling, because this is going to happen. Companies are going to leave. They are not going to invest. They are not going to do all these things. Is there any real data to support that? Don't you see investors demanding this climate disclosure as I have? Ms. Fisch. Absolutely. And part of the reason the SEC's final release was so long is because the SEC, which is deeply immersed in the market and in deep conversations with investors with summarizing the thousands of investor comments saying we need this information and explaining why this information is important. And I should just say that the investors' perspective by and large is that this information is important to our financial assessment. Sure, investors can invest for a variety of different reasons, but the large investors, the institutional investors are saying this information is financially material. This helps us investigate, is the company going to lose its insurance coverage? Is the company going to lose physical assets to a flood or other event? And again, we don't have to debate, is it human cost, is it climate change, or is it just some random flood? The point is these are business risks. This is economic vulnerability that investors are demanding. And I should just say that the discussion earlier that the SEC should prevent companies from disclosing Scope 3 emissions, number one, if there are any First Amendment problems, the idea that the SEC would tell companies you can't disclose what the market wants, what your investors want, to me, that is just incredible. The other is that disclosure is designed to facilitate the market responding to and evaluating this information. This is not some heavy-handed merit-based regulation. We have these capital markets. Investors say they need this. Let's give them what they want. Ms. Garcia. Right. And do you have any data on the number of investors who did file comment letters and how many of them supported climate change and how many didn't? Ms. Fisch. There were thousands of comment letters--how you quantify it depends a little bit on whether you are looking at individual comment letters. In this kind of thing, there are a lot of form letters as well, but basically, 99 percent of the investors said, we support Scope 1 and 2 emissions disclosure, and 97 percent said, we support Scope 3 emissions disclosure. The numbers are just overwhelmingly high. Ms. Garcia. Okay. Now, something else caught my ear that one of my colleagues said earlier. As a layperson, I was a little offended. It almost sounded like they think that these disclosure requirements are too complicated and too high level for the average investor to understand, the noninstitutional, the retail investor. What is your reaction to that? Do you not think that the average person understands that the climate change issue is higher risk, so we should know about it? To me, it seems simple. Ms. Fisch. I think there are a whole range of retail investors out there with different levels of understanding. There are financial reporters, there are securities analysts that can help investors understand that information. There are intermediaries like asset managers that can help investors. But at the end of the day, investors are entitled to this information. They are entitled to use whatever resources are available to them to evaluate the information, and they are entitled to invest according to their preferences. Ms. Garcia. Not very complicated, isn't it? Ms. Fisch. No. Ms. Garcia. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Meuser. The gentlelady's time has expired. Mr. Steil is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Steil. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to dive back into materiality because I think we are missing what might be one of the most important topics here today, and we are speaking past that. I listened to you, Professor Fisch, and you said, I think, something along the lines of, investors want it, so give them what they want. And then you cited a study, I think, that reviewed 320 institutional investors and you came up with 97 percent. It is an incredibly small sample of people. I would say what people really want is material information, rather than allowing activist investors or the loudest voices in the room to dictate what is or what is not disclosed, because as noted through today's conversation, the disclosure process is incredibly expensive and time-consuming. There is an appropriate need for that if it is material, but if it is not material, it is simply an activity to abate those that want it--your term, right, ``those that want it.'' You would say, as I listened to you, give them what they want. Do you concern yourself with whether or not the information, ``that they want,'' is material? Yes or no, does materiality matter to you in this context? Ms. Fisch. Materiality absolutely matters to me. Mr. Steil. Okay, great. So, it matters to you. Should it be definitive as to whether or not the information is disclosed? As a core tenet of securities law, do you believe that if the information is not material, that it is, therefore, not material and does not need to be disclosed? Ms. Fisch. I guess I am not---- Mr. Steil. No, no, no. Just yes or no. Do you think if it is material, that it matters? Ms. Fisch. I guess I don't think that materiality is as clear a binary as you are suggesting, and so there is---- Mr. Steil. It is pretty darn clear, right? There is plenty of securities case law on this point and topic. There are significant boardroom discussions on this. Every securities law attorney goes through a thorough process with public companies to determine whether or not information is material. This is heavily litigated. It is very clear. There is plenty of case law on the topic. I would encourage you to read further into this, but let's go one step further. If it is or is not material, does it need to be disclosed? Ms. Fisch. The Supreme Court case law is---- Mr. Steil. But do you think---- Ms. Fisch. ----in securities fraud. Mr. Steil. Do you think---- Ms. Fisch. And securities fraud is different from the SEC's power required to do this---- Mr. Steil. No, you could sue on filings for lack of disclosure, and so what I am asking you is, do you think that the information needs to be material? Ms. Fisch. Do I think which information needs to be material? The information---- Mr. Steil. Do you think the SEC should require people to provide information that is not material to investors? Is that your position? Ms. Fisch. I think the SEC has done that and will continue to do that. Mr. Steil. And you think they should in this case? Ms. Fisch. I think the SEC has a long tradition of requiring disclosure---- Mr. Steil. I am not asking about their tradition. I am asking a very clear question, ma'am. I am asking whether or not you think the information, if it is not material, should still be disclosed. Yes or no? Ms. Fisch. I think the SEC has a long history of requiring disclosures that are---- Mr. Steil. I am not asking about the history, ma'am. So, a notice to those watching this, we are going to ask one more time because it is a very clear question: If it is not material, should it be required to be disclosed? It is a simple question. Ms. Fisch. This rule doesn't require any disclosure of non- material information. You are asking about this rule and not-- -- Mr. Steil. Okay. Let's pause there, because you are really fighting to not say that you want non-material information to be disclosed, because now you are saying it is material. If it is not material, is it correct that you are okay with it not being disclosed because it is not material? Ms. Fisch. No, I didn't say that. Mr. Steil. Right. I am trying to have a conversation. Ms. Fisch. Right. Mr. Steil. So, yes or no, non-material information needs to be disclosed, in your opinion? Ms. Fisch. I think there are any number of---- Mr. Steil. So, you can't even give me a yes-or-no opinion. Why? Because materially is the cornerstone of securities law. If you have a background in securities law, it is really tough to say on the record that you want non-material information to be required to be disclosed. And when we hear this time and again from my colleagues on the left, they want non-material information to be disclosed all the time. We have seen human resources (HR) policies put forward. We have seen policies that relate to climate put forward. Those of us on the right agree that when those policies are material, they should be disclosed. So if you are Exxon, there is probably a materiality threshold and you should probably put it forward. If you are an HR consulting company, it is probably not material, and it probably doesn't need to be disclosed. But there are those on the left who want to play to their activists, who are unconcerned about the economic burden being passed on to every consumer in the United States of America, and who have no problem with the fact that through red tape, we drive inflation higher, and we discourage U.S. companies from going public. And on the record, a simple yes-or-no question, we have seen it refused to be answered at least 4 times, which is beyond frustrating. It is why we have to continue to fight against non-material information being required to satisfy activist investors. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Meuser. The gentleman yields back. The gentlewoman from Michigan, Ms. Tlaib, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. Tlaib. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think so many people always forget how many times the American taxpayer has bailed out folks for just really hiding the truth from the public, especially in areas that we know are risks. And folks want to agree, but they don't actually want to do anything about the fact that climate risk is a financial risk. In my community, I cannot tell you how many times we have had floods. They say, this is a record flood, and I am like, I don't know. This is four in a row, but we continue to say, let's do nothing. But then, when these financial institutions making these real huge risks, putting really our economy at risk, we bail them out. We bail them out instead of telling them to do what is right, which is providing information so that we can make much more informed decisions. So if your company has gone all in on an outdated business model, then workers who have put their savings into a company deserve to know that. I just don't understand why we are so hesitant in doing it other than the fact that they don't want to consider this a risk because, for them, they will just get bailed out by the United States, that we, the American taxpayer, will just bail them out. That is exactly what we continue to do, and you all know it. You do. We always do when they don't tell us the truth or they are not disclosing what is necessary for us to make those informed decisions. Professor Fisch, can you explain what climate-related physical and transition risks are and provide some examples? Ms. Fisch. Climate-related physical and transition risks, and I have several examples in my written remarks, include things like the vulnerability of physical assets to what you just said, to floods, to extreme weather events. Last week, in Philadelphia, we had an earthquake, so everyone went around and inspected the buildings to see if they were structurally sound. That is a physical risk that a company might have to take into account. Transition risks include responding to whether you think there are climate-related risks, whether you think there are regulatory risks, whether your cost of power or the sources of power that you are entitled to use are going to go up, whether natural resources like water supply are going to be vulnerable, right? Those are all risks that face any company. Ms. Tlaib. So, we are talking about transparency? Ms. Fisch. Yes. Ms. Tlaib. Yes. Professor Fisch, does the SEC rule require companies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions or install solar panels, anything like that? They are not asking them do that, right? Ms. Fisch. Absolutely not, and in fact---- Ms. Tlaib. They are talking about just disclosing first, right? Ms. Fisch. Yes. Ms. Tlaib. Okay. I just want to make sure because folks are saying that, and that is not truthful. I would like to turn now to concerns about compliance costs. That is another one. This is interesting. We are talking about companies that just have a ton of money, and, again, we just bailed them out. The Wall Street Journal has reported that roughly 3,000 U.S. companies will have to make disclosures to comply with the European Union's corporate sustainability reporting directive. Professor Fisch, can you compare the EU's reporting standards with those in the SEC's final rule? Which reporting framework is more demanding? Ms. Fisch. The European standards are way more demanding. It is reporting not just on climate-related risks, but a broader stretch of environmental risks. It is reporting on other sustainability issues as well. The European reporting system will require disclosure of Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. It will require disclosure not limited by economic materiality to investors. Europe applies a double---- Ms. Tlaib. I am not trying to simplify it. Wouldn't they just have to copy what they are already providing to the EU? Ms. Fisch. Well, a substantial number of U.S. companies are going to be subject to that regime, yes. Ms. Tlaib. Okay. Because they are complaining about compliance costs, and I am like, don't you have to do the reporting for the EU, which is much more demanding? Ms. Fisch. Yes, that is true. Ms. Tlaib. I don't know. Maybe I am oversimplifying this for folks. California has adopted two laws requiring large companies to disclose their climate-related financial risks in greenhouse gas emissions. Professor Fisch, how do reporting requirements of SB 253 and SB 261 compare with the SEC's climate rule? Ms. Fisch. Again, those reporting requirements are more demanding than the SEC standard. Ms. Tlaib. That is all I want to know. Ms. Fisch. A lot of companies that would be subject to the SEC rule will have to comply with the California rule whether or not the SEC adopted its current rule. And I should note that California's rule extends to private companies as well, so what we heard earlier about how these compliance costs are going to drive companies into the private markets, that is not true for Europe, and that is not true for California. Ms. Tlaib. I know that Reuters reported that roughly 5,000 companies will have to comply with SB 253, while approximately 10,000 companies will be subject to SB 261. Another analyst found that 73 percent of Fortune 1000 companies will be covered by both laws. Is that correct? Ms. Fisch. I believe that is right, yes. Ms. Tlaib. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Meuser. The gentlelady yields back. The gentleman from South Carolina, Mr. Norman, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Norman. Thank you to the panelists for being here today. Ms. Fisch, let me get back to what Congressman Steil mentioned about what is material and what is not. In one of the, I guess, footnotes in this 886-page rule are the words, ``severe weather events and other natural conditions.'' Is that a material risk? Ms. Fisch. I think the qualifier of, ``severe,'' is a pretty clear indicator that the SEC intends to limit this to material risks. Mr. Norman. So, it is material? Ms. Fisch. Yes. Mr. Norman. Okay. If I, on my statement, put that these are my insurance costs for hurricane risk, for flooding risk, and let that line item go, would that satisfy the SEC? Ms. Fisch. I am not sure I follow the question. Mr. Norman. So, in trying to comply with this rule, would the SEC take the statement to answer that particular footnote, the cost to my company is the insurance that I buy that the stockholders ultimately pay? Ms. Fisch. I don't think the SEC's requirement is even that demanding. I think what the SEC is saying is if you suffer a hurricane or an earthquake and your building falls down, you have to disclose that cost, companies engaged in a high degree of planning, insurance, and so forth, and that is required by the SEC rule. Mr. Norman. I get all that, but it wouldn't take more than one sentence, ``this is my insurance cost, this covers the risk that you are talking about.'' Do we have to include forest fires? Ms. Fisch. I think the point of severe weather or other natural conditions is so that companies wouldn't have to parse that line drawing, is a forest fire a weather event or is it some other severe condition. I don't know if that is true for earthquakes. I don't know if that is true for tornadoes and so forth. I guess the SEC is just trying to simplify that decision for companies. Mr. Norman. They haven't simplified it. That is why I said, ``nebulous.'' How do you define that? How do you answer what the SEC wants? I will just answer it in my company. This is my cost, insurance costs, yes or no, and I think that would make sense. Are you tenured? Ms. Fisch. Yes. Mr. Norman. Okay. Mr. Wright, are you tenured? Mr. White. I am not. Mr. Wright. I am not. Mr. White. Oh, go ahead. Mr. Wright. Oh. Mr. Norman. No. Mr. Wright. Mr. White. I'm sorry. Mr. Wright. I am not. Mr. Norman. What is the difference in your line of work and in Dr. Fisch's? Mr. Wright. It is just a different world. I am in the commercial space, she is in the academic space, and---- Mr. Norman. In the academic space, your tenure relies on performance. For Liberty Energy, you are on a different set of scales and you look at it differently. In your opinion, if I ask you to have to answer the severity of weather events and trying to describe it, what would you put? Mr. Wright. What would I prefer? It would have been nice if they would spell out what other physical events are. Mr. Norman. It is nebulous, and I don't know how you answer that. We major in the minor up here, and it is political science up here with my good friends on the left. The diatribe that you heard about from Mr. Horsford, we actually agree. I am in the housing business. Prices are way up. Now, his answer is higher taxes and more regulations. My answer is maybe start drilling and maybe buying oil and gas from America instead of foreign countries that don't like us, maybe cut regulations, maybe cut the cost of the illegal immigration that is coming in all over this country, and the $4,000 we are giving each one of them, and a driver's license and a phone. Maybe, that would cut the cost instead of higher taxes and what is happening to this country. I admire your courage when you did not raise your hand about, do you believe in climate change? That is a totally backward question, and I will let you further respond to that. I know you were asked about that. Mr. Wright. Yes. Just the expression implies faith. Climate change isn't religion. I have written multiple books showing the data about climate change. So to me, climate change is a physical phenomenon we should seek to understand with the real data, not the sensationalized data, and when we show data, we show datasets from the start to the end. We don't cherry-pick. We don't look at it. It is a real thing. It is a global phenomenon, but a sober understanding of it is just critical. And emissions are the same thing, too. What is the best way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions? Ultimately, it is just going to be technology. The biggest driver of U.S.-reduced greenhouse gas emissions has been natural gas displacing coal. Mr. Norman. Are we able to control hurricanes and earthquakes? Mr. Wright. No. Mr. Norman. So, we can't control that, and to say otherwise, the facts don't bear that out. Thank you so much. Mr. Wright. Thank you, Congressman. Mr. Meuser. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize myself for 5 minutes. Mr. Wright, I like what you just said at the end: Technology is the answer here. I think we are all conservationists. Heck, I would characterize myself as an environmentalist at this point. That is kind of your business, clean energy, right? You don't come in with all your equipment and your technology and all your R&D investment. It is good business for you. It is good business for those with whom you are doing business. It is good business for my former company. Now, the light is shut off when you come in, and employees like it. It is a social trend maybe to my colleagues here in the House, and certainly the regulators. The private sector is minimizing carbon emissions far more without the regulatory burdens--far more than the regulators or this Congress would do. I will ask you, since that is your business, how much of your R&D expense goes into minimizing carbon emissions? Mr. Wright. I would say quite a bit. We have over 2 million horsepower of equipment. To get oil and gas from underground, it takes energy to push it down, so typically, large industrial machinery is powered by diesel. That is the dominant industrial fuel around the world, and we are moving that to a new generation of equipment that burns natural gas. Mr. Meuser. Yes. Mr. Wright. And not just natural gas, but at the highest thermal efficiency possible, to use the---- Mr. Meuser. Has the SEC, the regulators come to you and said, hey, do you have any ideas on some of the best rules that we should be implementing here? Mr. Wright. No. Mr. Meuser. And do you think the same regulators that want to attack you and attack our domestic energy industry--let's just face it, they literally choose Venezuela over my home State of Pennsylvania for natural gas. Do you think some of them use electricity, oil, or gasoline on occasion? Mr. Wright. Quite likely. Mr. Meuser. Yes, probably. Here and there, I am sure, and far less than us, of course. The rule is the rule, but we are okay to have complaints about it or issues about it, or you always want to make a plan better. But it is targeted to who I hear back from in the real world, who I talk to in industry about dealing with complying with this plethora of rules coming out of the SEC. The real problems are in the energy industry, which you are used to, because you are just under regular assault. Being a USA flagship energy industry makes you a terrible person, and the farmers are the ones being concerned here. And by the way, where is inflation hitting most? Energy and groceries. So, isn't this wonderful that we are dealing with something here that is going to inflate the inflationary situation that my constituents deal with, particularly low-income constituents who can't even afford the groceries and the gasoline? I am going to stick with you for a moment, Mr. Wright. How damaging, and is there a better way we could go about some of this compliance, and minimizing emissions, and truly trying to work together to gain as much clean energy in a best transition manner sooner rather than later other than these rules? Mr. Wright. Yes, absolutely. I think there is a passion in the country--we have seen some of that today--and around the world. I say the world needs more energy, better energy, and the U.S. has certainly been a leader in that. Our industry is a leader of that. It is mostly rural people who grew up on the land. We want to shrink our footprint on the land. We want to make the air cleaner. We want to use less energy to produce energy and produce cheaper energy. Mr. Meuser. Okay. Mr. Wright. The thing I celebrate about the shale revolution the most is it lowered the cost of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, and that makes people's lives better. Marketplaces drive improvement, lower costs, increased---- Mr. Meuser. Okay. Do you think the SEC has overstepped its authority here with this regulation? Mr. Wright. I absolutely believe so. Mr. Meuser. Okay. We will move on to former SEC Chairman Roisman. What do you think? What would you have done here? Mr. Roisman. They didn't ask me, but if you are asking me now, I think that the rules in place make sense. It is a materiality standard. If you had concerns that it wasn't enough, you can update the 2010 guidance, and that would have been a very simple thing and probably a lot less controversial. Mr. Meuser. And would have been more acceptable to industries because God forbid this Administration do anything that industry and our economy actually appreciates as opposed to adding regulation and burdens. But do you think it will be more acceptable to industry? Mr. Roisman. I do. Mr. Meuser. Okay. My time has expired. The gentleman from New York, Mr. Garbarino, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Garbarino. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to all of the witnesses for being here today. In a challenging global economy, the strength of our capital markets is vital to long-term economic growth. However, rising costs and increased regulatory burdens prevent some businesses from entering our public markets. The SEC's newly-finalized climate rule would just pile on to the rising costs associated with a company going and remaining public. The SEC estimates that the rule will increase the typical cost of being a public company by 21 percent. This doesn't include the indirect costs associated with the rules such as loss management time, board distraction, and changes in company operations. Professor White, would you explain what impact such a sudden, significant increase in compliance costs will have on public companies? Mr. White. Yes. For the companies that are already public, if they spend more time meeting compliance rather than focusing on the growth of their business, that can destroy value for their investors. For companies that are thinking about going public, I would expect it will limit those companies from doing so, which is going to trickle down and hurt investors because they have fewer opportunities to diversify their portfolio. They have fewer investments that they can make, which can damage their returns. It also harms market liquidity. So, it can actually hurt all investors. Mr. Garbarino. That actually was my next question, what was it going to do to private companies thinking about going public. It would probably keep most of them going public, yes. So, what impact will these costs both for private and public companies have on American competitiveness? Would you expect companies to begin to increase their activities in jurisdictions where similar costs are not required? Mr. White. Yes. You think about going public and where to operate both in the U.S. and globally. Now, we compete against companies all over the world, so if a jurisdiction offers you better terms in terms of being public, lower costs, but you still get access to investor capital and liquid markets, then you would migrate to those jurisdictions, which could end up having both tax revenue leave the United States as well as human capital and really high-skilled technologies. Mr. Garbarino. So at a time when we are trying to bring manufacturing, all sorts of jobs back into the country, a lot of investment has gone into that. This rule created by the SEC, not Congress, outside of the SEC's jurisdiction, could end up causing us to lose jobs and capital to other places across the world? Mr. White. Yes, that is the incentive. Mr. Garbarino. Yes. Staying on the subject of increased costs, Mr. Wright, you mentioned in your testimony how Liberty is subject to the climate rule and faces compliance costs to meet the rule's reporting timelines. You go on to mention how the rule will make energy production more expensive by driving up compliance costs and making conditions more difficult for investment. Would you summarize what new costs your company must incur to successfully comply with the rule, and specifically, how these costs will be more problematic for smaller public companies than larger public companies? Mr. Wright. Yes. And, of course, we don't know the number today, but we look at it as similar to Sarbanes-Oxley. We probably spend somewhere between a half million and a million dollars in third-party costs to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley. Mr. Garbarino. What was that number? Mr. Wright. Somewhere between a half-million and a million dollars. Mr. Garbarino. A million dollars. Mr. Wright. And our expectation was this would be similar. My fear is it would be worse because we are counting something that is ultimately not precisely countable, so where do we draw that line of a good enough guesstimate? One of my bigger problems is just the uncertainty around the ability to even deliver these numbers, where we drive greenhouse gas emissions by innovations, by equipment. We talk about this stuff all the time. Our big-picture progress in greenhouse gas emissions is pretty well-known to investors, and employees in our company. This distracts from that effort, and we have to count something that is not perfectly quantifiable. That is unsettling to me. Mr. Garbarino. I actually was at the U.N. Conference of the Parties (COP) this year, and oil and gas companies spent a lot of time there talking about what they have already done to lower greenhouse emissions. So, us doing something in that regulatory environment or putting another regulatory burden on these companies that would actually take away from that, I think is just a terrible idea and actually is counteractive to what the SEC is trying to do here but doesn't have the authority to do it. We have seen plenty of leadership from U.S. companies, especially gas and oil companies to do right by greenhouse gas emissions. I am running out of time, so I want to thank you for all for your answers, and I yield back. Mr. Fitzgerald. . I am now going to recognize myself for 5 minutes. Among the specific requirements in the rule, the required disclosures for greenhouse gas emissions data stand out as especially burdensome. These reporting requirements do not track with what is currently tracked by companies and when that information can be reliably reported. The exemption for smaller reporting companies (SRCs) is far too narrow, and this rule will impact many smaller- and medium-sized manufacturers, which make up the substantial share of businesses, certainly in my Fifth District. And as you know, even with a limited safe harbor in place, the SEC acknowledges that the climate rule will expose companies to increased litigation risk. I am concerned that the risk will prevent companies from going or remaining public. Mr. Stebbins, would you explain why the climate rule's limited safe harbor is not enough to protect companies against increased litigation risks? Mr. Stebbins. Thank you. The safe harbor only covers certain select disclosures, and it doesn't cover historical facts, and those disclosures are primarily going to be comprised of historical facts. And a leading law firm recently wrote a memo about the adopting release, and they concluded, or they advised, that you should not give too much credence to that safe harbor because of the fact that, because it is typically going to be used by historical facts that is going to be your disclosure. So they advised, don't give it too much credence, and I agree with that advice. I think that is sound. Mr. Fitzgerald. Very good. Proponents of the final rule will often argue that climate-related disclosures are necessary in response to the demands of investors. However, I am concerned that the SEC has finalized the rule not to the benefit of investors, but instead to placate activists who consider climate-related objectives important. Rather than focusing on the financial interests of the shareholders, this idea of stakeholder capitalism that some companies have embraced comes off as more of a public relations stunt to evade the actual accountability. Shareholder rights are well-defined, but if a company has an obligation to a nebulous group of stakeholders, it is ultimately not accountable to anyone. Mr. Roisman, would you explain why these activists may be better understood as stakeholders and not as investors? Mr. Roisman. When people talk about stakeholders, as you mentioned, it is not just stockholders. It can be your customers. It can be your employees. It can be the community. It can be the government. It is not just the people who own your company. And one of the concerns that some of the dissenting Commissioners had about this was that these rules may be crafted more to satisfy stakeholders than the Main Street investor than, historically, the SEC thought. Mr. Fitzgerald. Very good. Chairman Gensler often kind of hides behind this argument that many rulemakings are authorized by Congress, and has said that as he has testified in front of Congress, believe it or not. However, a study that analyzed the SEC's rulemaking agenda under his tenure found that 39 rule proposals, or approximately 80 percent, were not required by congressional statute. Many of the proposals overlap and could have unintended consequences that risk undermining our capital markets. Probably a good example is the proposals to change beneficial ownership and securities-based swaps and their disclosures and how that may impair liquidity. This could lead to harmful activities, such as front-running or diminished corporate governance checks and balances, I guess you could say. Mr. Stebbins, can you discuss the authority the SEC is relying on for the climate rule and your thoughts on whether they even have this authority in the first place? Mr. Stebbins. They are relying on their general investor protection authority. There is no specific authority for this rule. They clearly have the authority to pass laws related to the environment because they have them already based on the investor protection authorization you could regulate environmental risks. We still make that disclosure already. It is already required. So all material environmental risks are already required to be disclosed. The question is, does that authority let you do this law? I don't think it is going to be held up. I think the Supreme Court or the Eighth Circuit is likely to find it to be a violation of the major questions doctrine, but that is for the Court to decide, not for me. Mr. Fitzgerald. Very good. My time has expired. We are now going to move on to the gentlewoman from California, Mrs. Kim. Mrs. Kim. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to thank our witnesses for being with us today for long hours. I want to talk about my concern that regulations proposed by SEC Chair Gensler will increase compliance costs and disincentivize private companies from going public. According to a recent CNN article, there were 7,300 publicly-traded companies in the United States in 1996, and today, there are 4,300. That is a significant decrease. I am troubled by the SEC's own estimates that this rule we are discussing today will increase the costs of being a public company by 21 percent. Mr. Roisman, in your testimony you discussed the complexities of considering foreign and State regulatory regimes on top of the SEC's proposal. Unfortunately, my home State of California is the only State mandating disclosure of Scope 3 emissions. So, can you elaborate on the difficulties and the costs that public companies will have to bear to comply with different rules from multiple jurisdictions? Mr. Roisman. Sure. I think the SEC makes it clear that, undoubtably, costs will rise as a result of this. Even if companies are tracking this information right now, it is very different to track and collect it to be put into an SEC filing which is subject to higher litigation or, more likely, litigation. In terms of Scope 3 or Scope 2 even, there are, essentially, provisions within the rule that say you need to take into account if you are subject to material sort of regulatory risk because you are disclosing information due to a California law or European law, and you are going to have to take that into account in making a materiality assessment. I think some of the concerns people are saying, and I think Mr. Wright did a very good job of explaining this, is that some of these numbers are just not easy to come up with. I am not in the industry, I am just a lawyer, but the level of sort of compliance and outside expertise that are going to be needed in order for me to advise clients that what they are doing is sufficient for being able to put the stuff into their SEC filings is high. And even people who are doing it right now, I am not sure they are ready for that. Mrs. Kim. Thank you. Mr. Roisman, and Mr. Stebbins, I want to give you both an opportunity to respond to a few arguments that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have made throughout the hearing. Specifically, we have been hearing that the SEC's rule is somehow weak or preferred because the California and European requirements extend to Scope 3 emissions and apply to private companies. First, can you remind us if California should set Federal securities policy? And second, could you explain what the difference is from a litigation risk perspective between complying with European disclosure requirements versus including climate-related information in SEC filings? Either one of you. Mr. Roisman. I will start. I think the role of the SEC or Congress is to set both Federal laws and Federal rules. To your question about, is there a difference between complying with State and European regulators, there is absolutely a difference, and especially with Europe. What people often forget is there is not the litigation risk for companies in Europe that there is in the United States for putting things in their filings. So, I do think companies need to stand behind what they say, but there is a difference between putting something in a voluntary report than it is into your SEC filings. Mrs. Kim. Okay. Do you want to add to that, Mr. Stebbins, or should we move on? Mr. Stebbins. I think we should move on. Mrs. Kim. Okay. Thank you. I want to talk about my legislation, the REG Act. Considering that the SEC, under Chairman Gensler, is failing to assess the aggregate cost of regulations in a proper way, I introduced H.R. 7030, the REG Act, to require the SEC to consider the cumulative effects of every rulemaking. I want to ask this question to Professor White. The SEC's cost-benefit analysis notably fails to account for the ways in which rules interconnect. It also fails to assess the aggregate impacts of each new rule with other rules with which companies are required to comply. So, would you explain why it is concerning that the SEC only considers the cost of the climate rule in isolation? Mr. White. Yes. Thank you for the question. I think it is important to realize that none of these regulations or rules operate in a vacuum. Companies have to make many disclosures to their stakeholders and stockholders through their Form 10-Ks. And when you analyze a rule in isolation, you might be able to assess that through a cost-benefit analysis, which I wrote at the SEC when I was an economist. And when you put all those together, if you are looking at 2024, Chair Gensler said there were many more disclosure rules coming down the line, human capital---- Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentlewoman's time has expired. Mr. White. Yes. Mrs. Kim. Thank you very much. I yield back. Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentlewoman yields back. We will now recognize the gentleman from Nebraska, Mr. Flood, for 5 minutes. Mr. Flood. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Here we are yet again dealing with Chair Gensler's, ``fountain of bad ideas.'' That is not my term. I heard that from one of our most respected senior members on this committee. But let's take a look at the SEC's climate rule's overall purpose. Why did it even come into being in the first place? Chair Gensler argues that the rule simply measures a risk that was already in the market. In his statement following the issuance of the final rule, he said that this rule was simply an extension of the SEC's commitment to, ``complete and truthful disclosure,'' regardless of the type of risk. However, when you take a step back and you look at the lead-up to the SEC's climate rule, it is apparent that this rule is not about accurately capturing one more material risk for public companies. Proponents of the rule express as much very openly. They say that the rule will help support, ``the goal of net zeros greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 or sooner,'' or to, ``drive aggressive reductions,'' in greenhouse gas emissions.'' You can't have it both ways. You will notice that those particular goals aren't about disclosure for investors. They are not about accurately capturing risk associated with extreme weather events or responding to investor demand. Instead, they say the quiet part out loud. This rule is about pursuing climate goals, not well- tailored disclosures, period. This makes sense when viewed in the larger political context. President Biden has repeatedly vowed to use any power he has to combat climate change wherever possible, and this rulemaking is yet another step in that direction. Mr. Wright, do you believe the SEC's climate rule is fundamentally about promising material disclosure or reducing emissions? Mr. Wright. No, I don't believe it is about either. I don't think it is about material disclosure, again, because we can't count those numbers. The basic facts of our emissions, their investors can assess that many other ways, but I think the impact of it, of course, will be increased greenhouse gas emissions by moving production from here to there. So, I don't think it could be truly designed to reduce emissions either. Mr. Flood. Point well taken. Following up on that, something in your testimony that I have already found interesting today is, if you take for granted that the SEC views climate as simply a risk like any other, then why does this rule include so many detailed reporting requirements that other, clearly material risks do not? Mr. Wright. I don't know. It is hard to explain the nature of this rule, and if it was just material--look, I have to disclose anything that is a material risk to my business, that is what I do. To mention extreme weather, that is a real risk. That has been a risk forever, and it is not on an upward trend. So, I don't know the new information there. And the thing that maybe concerns me the most is there is materiality in there, but it is sort of a fake for the oil and gas industry, because if you face transition risk, which means if the government makes it harder for our customers to produce oil and gas in the United States, that is a threat to our industry. That is not a climate risk. Mr. Flood. That is material then, yes. Mr. Wright. That is a policy risk, that is material, but I don't know how to discuss or project a risk. I don't know what future rules are going to do. Mr. Flood. SEC Commissioner Peirce mentioned that no other type of risk requires, ``prescriptive forward-looking disclosure of the risks impact on a company's business strategy.'' SEC Commissioner Uyeda pointed out the specific requirements related to disclosing details around severe weather losses and beyond what a company would be required to do for any other type of risk. All that is to say that the SEC's climate rule does not merely identify an existing risk in the marketplace. It requires disclosures that elevate climate and emissions information above other requirements. If I were a public company, the number-one material risk if we are going to put everything under the sun would be the fact that this country is $34 trillion dollars in debt. That is material. That is where the SEC Chair should start. Following up, Mr. Wright, what does this newfound focus on climate from the SEC mean for your company and others in the energy business? Mr. Wright. Increased complexity, increased cost, and increased risk, and, therefore, fewer new companies, less new capital on the margin, less new activity, and less new production in the country. Mr. Flood. Well said. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize the gentleman from Iowa, Mr. Nunn, for 5 minutes. Mr. Nunn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to our witnesses for joining us here today. Under SEC Chairman Gensler's leadership, in Iowa, my home State, small and mid-sized businesses are being crushed by both ill-thought-out rules and increased compliance costs. This pro- Green New Deal and anti-job-making rule for the SEC is just the latest offense in a long line of decisions by unelected D.C. bureaucrats forcing businesses to comply with unreasonable, and unnecessary, in my opinion, bureaucratic red tape. I would like to be able to see all the witnesses there and just remind them that this 5,000 pages in front of me is just the start of what the SEC has done to hometown businesses and farmers in places like Iowa. It represents all the new financial rules forced on Iowa companies, and this is just in the last year alone, and with this new rule, we are adding 886 additional pages to the stack. This does not include the existing rules or regulations. By anyone's measure, this is unconscionable. This is far more than what anyone would expect a small town or hometown business to do, and, quite simply, it is outrageous. I am perplexed how this Administration thinks that businesses can thrive or even survive in this slosh and deluge of red tape and the environment. With that, Professor White, I would like to begin on the rulemaking and the ripple-on effects of this for capital formation. Conservative estimates suggest that an increase in compliance costs from this rule that we are discussing today alone will result in a 21-percent increase in how businesses back home attempt to function. Do you think this will impact their ability to stay open? Mr. White. Yes. Mr. Nunn. At the very least, will it prevent them from going public? Mr. White. For sure. Mr. Nunn. Could you talk to us a little bit about how you think this would impact a small or mid-sized company back in Des Moines, which is going to be treated the same as a Wall Street Titan? Mr. White. Small and mid-sized companies that are not exempt from the provisions in this rule would have an increase in compliance costs. It is much more difficult for them to amortize those costs over their assets, whereas a very large company, even though this is a real cost, has more assets and more ability to pass that on to customers. Mr. Nunn. Absolutely. More compliance officers, a bigger legal team, a bigger apparatus to do this. I am just from a little farm State in Iowa, but what we grow well, we grow agriculture and we grow wrestlers. And I can't imagine putting 160-pound high school wrestler in the same weight class as a 285-pound University of Iowa or Iowa State wrestler. The regulations in this environment need to follow the same aspect that we need to be able to treat different as different for a good reason and allow each to thrive in their own in this case, weight class or category to be successful. Mr. Wright, as we all know, the SEC's mission is to increase the ability for Main Street to have access to cash, this keeps them going. Will this rule by Chairman Gensler help with this goal to have increased access to capital? Mr. Wright. No. Mr. Nunn. In fact, I would suggest that this is actually going to put America's markets at a disadvantage. Would you agree? Mr. Wright. I agree. Mr. Nunn. Is there a solution that you would offer that could move us in the right direction? Mr. Wright. A financial risk regulator should not be getting into climate policy and the complexities of greenhouse gas emissions. I write materials every year trying to have a more open, thoughtful dialogue about climate policy and energy policy, and maybe we should have a little more of that. Mr. Nunn. I fully agree with you, and, Mr. Chairman, this is one of the reasons we will be writing a letter directly to the SEC on this. We would love your analysis on this to really shape this in the right place. Mr. Stebbins, to switch gears, I am increasingly concerned about the SEC's disregard for cost-benefit analysis and the lack of flexibility in its rulemaking. This is evident in the large number of companies that are suing the SEC now just to get clarity, because they can't get through this and get any consistency in what is coming out of the SEC. For example, the SEC's stock buyback rule was recently vacated because the SEC failed to complete a proper analysis and provide justification for the rules. Do you see the climate rule facing a similar legal challenge? Mr. Stebbins. I see the climate rule being challenged on three grounds: first, the major questions doctrine, which I just discussed; second, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), whether there is, what you talked about in the share repurchase case--in the Fifth Circuit, it was struck down under the APA by not having an adequate cost-benefit analysis and not showing that a real problem existed, so that will be a challenge. And the third challenge will be the First Amendment. Those will be the three challenges. Mr. Nunn. I think it is important today that we should not be in a situation where only the big guys get to sue and get clarity. The impact is a trickle-down all the way down to every farm and business in Iowa. And with that, Mr. Chairman, I thank the committee. And I yield back my time. Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentleman yields back. I will now recognize the gentlewoman from Texas, Ms. De La Cruz, for 5 minutes. Ms. De La Cruz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing, and thank you to the witnesses for being here to talk about rules that just go above and beyond what not only the companies have to deal with, but what the everyday investor has to deal with. In fact, my colleague, Mr. Nunn, really made an impact here when he showed us the amount of paperwork that a company, a growing company is going to have to deal with when they are looking at opportunities and growth. And let's just talk about for their own companies, but what does that mean for the everyday community member's economic impact, but let's just talk about the investor. I have my Series 6 and 63 licenses. I dealt with investments. I understand giving the common everyday person disclosures. Already, when we hand disclosures right now to investors, we hand them a packet that feels overwhelming to them, in fact, so much so that when I started in the 118th Congress, we actually passed legislation right here in this committee that would stop the paper version from coming to people's households because it was so much paperwork, and we made it into an electronic format so that it would go straight to their email. So, Mr. Roisman, are we really having a positive impact on our investors where they feel informed, or will they feel overwhelmed by not only receiving the disclosures that they receive right now but the disclosures that they will receive in addition because of this rule? Mr. Roisman. Thank you for that question. I think there will certainly be some investors who think this is important, and there are going to be investors who don't find this important. I think the concern you raised is one that, frankly, Commissioner Peirce raised as well in her dissent, which is entitled, ``green regs and spam,'' and she was concerned about spamming investors with more and more information. And I think that is sort of the line people always are concerned about is you want to provide information that is decision-useful for investors, but you don't want to overwhelm them. And I think that is a constant balance that every company is trying to meet. Ms. De La Cruz. Thank you, and I think what you said is very impactful, it is overwhelming to the average investor. So, what may be important or informative to a small group, what does the average investor feel when they receive it? And I would say quite simply, being in the business and dealing with the everyday investor, this is just simply overwhelming. But when we talk about individuals' and investors' economic impact, what about jobs? How will this ultimately affect job opportunities for the everyday American when it comes to companies having to deal with this climate rule? Would anybody like to take that on the---- Mr. Roisman. I feel like this is probably Mr. White's. Ms. De La Cruz. Mr. White? Yes. Mr. White. Sure. I can jump in here. The rule is estimated to raise costs by 20 percent, and there are many companies that aren't operating at 20-percent margins. So, some of those companies that have to take this cost and put it into their business model are going to be able to hire less on the margin. It might benefit jobs for accountants who work in this space. But as it trickles down towards smaller companies and has an impact on them going public or staying public, there is lots of academic evidence showing that IPOs create jobs, so to the extent that you disincentivize that, it would reduce employment. Ms. De La Cruz. As a small business owner myself, I understand in that planning for the future, we look at changes, whether it is growth or it is cost. And as a small business owner myself, I will look at the cost of doing business in increments of 2 to 5 percent that have a significant impact on the everyday small business owner or corporation, 3 to 5 percent. So when you tell a business owner like myself that you are estimating a public company will have a roughly 20-percent change, this is an enormous change that the company has to absorb, and will not only affect the way they do business, but will affect their investors and their employees as well. Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentlewoman's time has expired. Ms. De La Cruz. Thank you. Mr. Fitzgerald. I am sure that you can seek those answers. I am next going to recognize the gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. Ogles, for 5 minutes. Mr. Ogles. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Witnesses, thank you for being here. We are coming to the end. Mr. Chairman, if I may, I just want to point out that Professor White is from the good State of Tennessee, Vanderbilt University. I was actually on the Vanderbilt campus on Friday. So, go 'Dores, and thank you for being here. Mr. White. Thank you. Mr. Ogles. But welcome again. Last month, the committee traveled to my great State, where Representative Rose and I hosted a field hearing on this very same topic, where we heard then, just as we have heard today, about how the SEC's climate- related disclosure rules play to the tune of the Administration's obsession with their climate change religion. And I think you spoke to that, Mr. Wright, that you don't ascribe to this religion, nor do I. The rule is illegal and unconstitutional. By peppering investors with irrelevant information, as we see by this stack of paper behind me, it will make them less informed about what is important and will divert companies from their core purpose of maximizing shareholder wealth and creating products that increase everyone's standard of living. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a letter by Advancing American Freedom, which is signed by more than 60 conservative groups, encouraging Congress to end the SEC's climate disclosure rule. The SEC's job is to regulate securities, stocks and bonds, not to orchestrate a destructive climate agenda behind the backs of Americans and duly elected representatives---- Mr. Fitzgerald. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. Ogles. And I would say, Mr. Chairman, what we have seen with many of the agencies, including the SEC, is they are creating laws by way of rule, and enough is enough. We have to rein this in, and before us, we have a panel of experts who have spoken to this. Professor White, again, thank you for being here, go 'Dores. We have heard today about how the climate-related disclosure rule will affect capital formation. Can you discuss specifically both the long-term impact and the short-term impact as it relates to capital? Mr. White. Yes. In terms of the short-term impact and capital formation, if it makes it more expensive for companies to operate in terms of their compliance costs, then that is going to increase their cost of capital potentially, it is going to rely upon the tradeoff between the benefits and those costs. As you look to more of a longer-term scenario, even though the rule exempts some particular small companies, eventually those small companies grow into medium-sized and larger-sized companies that have to comply. So, I would expect a negative capital formation impact both in the near and the long term. Mr. Ogles. Yes, sir. And really briefly, Mr. White, you have a B.S. in finance, a Ph.D., and an M.B.A. in finance, and you are a professor of finance, and a former Economist for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, so I think it is fair to say you know numbers. Mr. White. Yes. Mr. Ogles. And you teach students? Mr. White. I do. Mr. Ogles. If you were teaching a course, and you assigned a project, would the cost-benefit analysis done by the SEC meet your standards? Mr. White. I think that the SEC has likely underestimated the costs. They are looking more at the direct cost of compliance, and they are also relying upon estimates of assessing some of these disclosures, some of which are uncertain, inherently. So, I know I would think that it would be below the standard for accurately assessing the impact. Mr. Ogles. Yes, sir. And Mr. Chairman, votes have been called, so I am about to yield back. But I just would like to say that perhaps Gary Gensler should take one of your courses before he does another cost-benefit analysis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentleman yields back. I would like to thank our witnesses for their testimony today. The Chair notes that some Members may have additional questions for this panel, which they may wish to submit in writing. Without objection, the hearing record will remain open for 5 legislative days for Members to submit written questions to these witnesses and to place their responses in the record. Also, without objection, Members will have 5 legislative days to submit extraneous materials to the Chair for inclusion in the record. This hearing is adjourned.  A P P E N D I X April 10, 2024
