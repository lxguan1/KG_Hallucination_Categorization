THE FUTURE OF ARMS CONTROL
AND DETERRENCE
----------
WEDNESDAY, MAY 15, 2024
U.S. Senate,
Committee on Foreign Relations,
Washington, DC.
The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:06 a.m., in
room SD-419, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Benjamin L.
Cardin, chairman of the committee, presiding.
Present: Senators Cardin , Shaheen, Murphy,
Kaine, Van Hollen, Risch, Romney, Young, and Barrasso.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BENJAMIN L. CARDIN,
U.S. SENATOR FROM MARYLAND
The Chairman. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will
come to order.
The Cuban Missile Crisis was, as one Kennedy aide said, the
most dangerous moment in human history. At the height of the
cold war arms race, one mistake or miscalculation could lead to
nuclear annihilation. But in the decades that followed,
carefully negotiated arms control agreements enable us to live
in a much safer world.
In recent years, however, there has been a serious reason
for concern. Russia has backed away from arms control
agreements. There are no more inspections. Our only remaining
nuclear weapon treaty, New START, expires in 2026, and Russia
is reportedly developing a nuclear capable anti-satellite
weapon which would violate the 1967 Outer Space Treaty.
Meanwhile, China has been rapidly building up its nuclear
arsenal, something we should be talking about with them at the
highest level.
So, this hearing comes at a critical time.
Secretary Jenkins, I want to thank you for appearing before
us today. I believe we must do everything in our power to avoid
getting into another nuclear arms race. I am pleased with how
the Biden administration has been balancing our needs. They
have kept the door open to negotiations with our adversaries,
while bolstering deterrence by working with our allies. They
are building up an international consensus to maintain a
peaceful outer space, and they are modernizing our forces.
On land, at sea, and through the air. We need to replace
and update our nuclear systems given the limits on nuclear
material. That means retrofitting our warheads. That is why the
Department of Energy's project to restore the production of
plutonium pits for the warheads is so important. While these
modernization efforts are the key to maintaining our
deterrence, we must not give up on arms control.
It is true that Russia has backed away from our agreements,
but they have not gone over the limits set by our treaties. I
have seen the projections saying China could have as many as
1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030, but we should not be basing our
decisions on assumptions about 2030 that may never happen.
These projections are what might happen if the United States
sits around and does not do anything about it.
But we should not be passive. That is why our diplomatic
efforts are so important. We must communicate to the leadership
of Beijing the dangers of the world where the United States and
China are locked in an arms race. Because while we have the
capability to counter their nuclear build up, we want to avoid
an Indo-Pacific with nuclear weapons posture that looks like
the cold war in Europe.
One of the most promising developments I have seen is the
Biden administration's cooperation with our allies in the
Europe and Indo-Pacific. More closely linked alliances like
AUKUS and the Washington Declaration with South Korea are
crucial in our efforts to counter our adversaries.
At the same time, I think we need to, to clearly
communicate that we are ready to sit down and talk. We are
ready to talk with Beijing. We are ready to talk with Moscow.
We did it at the height of the cold war. We are able to
compartmentalize. Despite the brutal invasion of Ukraine, we
should be able to do it now, too.
We need to open up the idea that while we might not get
legally binding agreements, we need to get political
understandings. Agreements can be verified with satellites,
agreements that will avoid another arms race, agreements that
will continue to keep us safe.
So, Madam Ambassador, we have a lot to talk about.
And let me first yield to our distinguished Ranking Member,
Senator Risch, for his opening comments.
STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES E. RISCH,
U.S. SENATOR FROM IDAHO
Senator Risch. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And
I agree of with some of the things that you have said. I have
been asking for this hearing for over a year, and this is a
really, really important hearing. Global events right now make
this a troubling hearing at a troubling time.
And why is this so important? Well, our Foreign Relations
Committee prides itself as being the soft power committee, and
that we look after national security by using soft power. But
soft power only works when it is backed up by hard power. Not
only hard power, but the best in the world. And also, with the
situation where our enemies and our friends believe that we
will actually use it when it is appropriate to do so. For
deterrence to be credible, it must be backed up by capability
and political will to follow through on the threat.
While we retain the world's strongest military, its
effectiveness has declined significantly. First under Obama,
now under the Biden administration. Our enemies need to believe
that when we tell them do not, and they do, that indeed, they
are going to get fire and brimstone raining down on their head.
They do not believe that anymore.
First, nuclear weapons are the ultimate foundation of
deterrence and have kept regional conflicts from becoming
global wars. Despite this, the Biden administration has doubled
down on the Obama era talking point of ``reducing the role for
nuclear weapons in our national security strategy.'' You do not
reduce the role of your ultimate foundation for deterrence. And
that is what the thought processes here by these two
Administrations.
In fact, the Administration demonstrated its commitment to
disarmament by extending the New START Treaty with Russia
within the first hours of taking office. There was no rigorous
policy process to support this decision, just blind faith in
arms control when everybody knew that Russia was cheating every
day. It was a gift to Russia.
In truth, the nuclear landscape of the cold war no longer
exists. Our adversaries have changed their strategies. Russia
and China, have and every day, are developing new nuclear
weapons and increasing their reliance on them. And they are
willing to cheat on treaties and gain an upper hand as the
Chairman noted.
The only way we know about this many times is through the
use of overhead observance. They do not tell the truth. They
lie to us. Despite this fact, the Administration continues
Obama's policy of begging China to engage in talks about
strategic stability. Meanwhile, China ignores our solicitations
and is racing to nuclear parity. These misguided policies
communicate to our adversaries that we so desperately want arms
control that we will surrender our own security.
Currently, the U.S. nuclear arsenal is required to maintain
parity with Russia under the New START Treaty, which Russia
violates, and a 2010 security environment when China had fewer
than 200 nuclear weapons. U.S. allies are understandably
anxious about the explosive growth of Chinese nuclear weapons,
and their delivery systems, and the likelihood that Russia will
rely more, not less, on these weapons.
Meanwhile, rogue nations like North Korea and Iran pursue
nuclear weapons, and the instability spreading around the world
only encourages more proliferation as other countries seek to
replace the lost American deterrence, and their growing
dissatisfaction with their reliance on America's commitments.
In Asia, extended deterrence is particularly weak. Unlike
in Europe, we withdrew all of our nuclear weapons from the
region. East Asian allies not only worry about China and
Russia, but a North Korea that is on track to field a diverse
nuclear arsenal in the hundreds.
The U.S. should modify our nuclear forces to reassert
deterrence and reassure our allies. Importantly, we should
explore options for returning nuclear weapons to the theater
for the purpose of assuring our allies. Discussing this should
not be a taboo. Our enemies are watching.
On the conventional weapons side, we experienced the same
problems. The Administration was right to pursue the idea of
AUKUS, but it has proven long on rhetoric and short on results.
Three years after AUKUS was announced, we are still operating
under the same defense trade rules that are important for AUKUS
from the cold war.
The Administration needs to certify our allies, take
advantage of the ITAR exemption in the 2024 NDAA, and provide a
clear path for expedited cooperation on capabilities not
covered by the exemption, like hypersonics and unmanned
systems. This is necessary if AUKUS is going to help deter
China.
In Israel and Gaza, the Biden administration is abandoning
Israel as it battles to ensure the lasting defeat of Hamas. The
lasting defeat of Hamas is the only way forward. Make no
mistake, America's allies and adversaries are watching. They
are drawing the conclusions that the U.S. is becoming an
unreliable friend.
And the Democrats' vendetta against Prime Minister
Netanyahu, coupled with this Administration's disastrous arms
sales policies and executions is politicizing weapon sales and
threatening America's ability to recruit and retain partners
and friends.
U.S. credibility has been severely eroded by the Biden
administration's vacillating support for Israel. This follows
similar behavior in supporting Ukraine. The Biden
administration's fear of escalation from the beginning led to
costly delays in providing critical weapons to Ukraine at
crucial moments. This constant dithering showed Russia that the
Biden administration was self-deterred, and exploiting this
fear of escalation would ensure U.S. inaction.
Who knows what lesson Kim Jong Un has learned from our
resolve? Even more consequentially, one has to ask what China
has learned. It is time to understand the world is different
and requires a dramatic shift in thinking about global
security. If we do not reestablish deterrence through strength
and resolve, instability will only increase.
Chairman McCaul and I have written a letter to the
Administration raising a number of these issues and asking for
some answers. I would like to include that in the record,
please.
The Chairman. Without objection, it will be included in the
record.
[Editor's note.--The information referred to above can be
found in the ``Additional Material Submitted for the Record''
section at the end of this document.]
The Chairman. The distinguished ranking member, your points
in regards to arms control and deterrence, there was much that
I thought we were in agreement. Some of the other points, I
think, we may differ a little bit on, but we will have an
opportunity to talk about that at the appropriate time.
We welcome Ambassador Bonnie Jenkins, who has served as
Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International
Security since July 22, 2021. As Under Secretary, Ambassador
Jenkins leads the Bureau of Arms Control, Deterrence and
Stability, the International Security and Nonproliferation
Bureau, and the Political Military Affairs Bureau. And as of
May 2023, Ambassador Jenkins has led the department's efforts
in AUKUS implementation.
Ambassador Jenkins previously served in the Obama
administration as special envoy and coordinator for the threat
reduction programs in the Bureau of International Security and
Nonproliferation from July 2009 until January 2017.
And during that time, she served as the State Department's
lead for all four nuclear security summits, as well as the U.S.
Representative to the G7 Global Partnership Against the Spread
of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction.
Well qualified, and we thank you for your public service.
Your statement will be made part of our record. You may
proceed as you wish. We ask that you try to summarize in about
5 minutes so that we have time for the committee to engage in
the conversation.
STATEMENT OF HON. BONNIE D. JENKINS, UNDER SECRETARY, ARMS
CONTROL AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE,
WASHINGTON, DC
Ms. Jenkins. Thank you very much.
Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Risch, distinguished
members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to
testify about the future of arms control and deterrence.
We at the State Department, together with our interagency
colleagues, work to mitigate international security risks. It
advances U.S. and ally interests. As the Under Secretary of
State for Arms Control International Security, I want to
emphasize that the global security architecture is under
strain. In response to these pressures, the three bureaus that
I oversee are applying a mix of tools in clear sighted and
innovative ways to uphold strategic stability.
One tool is deterrence. The 2022 Nuclear Policy Review
reaffirms our continuing commitment to a safe, secure, and
effective nuclear deterrence for the United States, as well as
our allies and partners. But reliance on deterrence alone will
not solve the security challenges. We as the NPR lays out, arms
control compliments deterrence, and both are essential to
strategic stability.
My opening testimony will address how the Department of
State, particularly the bureaus under my responsibility, is
using tools like arms control and risk reduction to preserve
strategic stability and secure U.S. and allied interests. I
want to begin by providing context. We are witnessing a Russia
that continues its work in Ukraine, routinely employs
irresponsible nuclear rhetoric, and has violated many of its
treaty obligations.
At the same time, it is been noted the People's Republic of
China has undertaken a rapid and opaque nuclear weapons build
up, and is pursuing a larger and more diverse nuclear arsenal
that calls into question its stated intentions and strategy.
Meanwhile, the emergence of new technologies, such as
artificial intelligence, simultaneously offers benefits while
introducing potential threats.
While challenging, the security environment also brings
opportunities to demonstrate U.S. leadership in promoting
stability. For decades, through hard work with allies,
partners, and adversaries alike, we have developed tools to
limit these dangers.
First, as it relates to Russia, the United States is
working to preserve strategic stability while holding Russia
accountable for its irresponsible behavior. This includes its
legally invalid purported suspension of the New STAR Treaty.
In an annual treaty implementation report that we provided
to this committee in January, the United States found Russia in
non-compliance with several of its treaty obligations. In 2023,
we adopted proportionate and reversible countermeasures, which
are fully consistent with international law. They aim to induce
Russia's return to full compliance with the treaty.
In 2026, New START, our last remaining bilateral nuclear
arms control agreement with Russia, will expire. We have
expressed our readiness to work with Moscow on managing nuclear
risk and developing a mutually acceptable future arms control
framework that advances U.S. and Allied interests. After all,
no one, including Russia benefits from an unconstrained
security environment.
Russia, however, has shown no interest in good faith
engagement on these issues. We are under no illusion that the
road ahead will be straightforward. After all, managing nuclear
competition with Russia has never been an easy task, and today
may be the most challenging as it has ever been.
Let me turn to the issue with the PRC. In 2023, as noted,
China military power reports estimate that the PRC possesses
more than 500 operational nuclear warheads. It will probably
have more than 1,000 by 2030. Beijing's development of a
larger, more diverse nuclear arsenal is deeply concerning and
raises questions about the trajectory of the PRC's nuclear
weapons program.
The PRC's expansion also raises the specter that the United
States may soon face two expansionary and significantly nuclear
armed peers. As this dynamic evolves, the United States must
continue to ensure a safe, secure, and effective nuclear
deterrent, as well as a strong and credible extended deterrent
while identifying opportunities to reduce risk and promote
transparency and predictability.
Last November, a State Department led interagency
delegation met with the PRC on issues related to arms control
and proliferation. The meeting enabled a preliminary discussion
on potential measures for managing and reducing risks.
Unfortunately, as noted, the PRC has declined a follow on
meeting, and has not provided a substantive response to risk
reduction suggestions we put forward.
In the outer space domain, the United States is upholding
existing obligations and ensuring responsible international
behavior. For almost 60 years, the Outer Space Treaty and its
prohibition on the placement of nuclear weapons in outer space
have been an important element of the international legal
framework.
Today, that regime is under threat. The Administration
assesses that Russia is developing a new satellite carrying a
nuclear device. Placement by a state party to the Outer Space
Treaty of a nuclear weapon in orbit would not only violate the
treaty, but also threaten the vital commercial and national
security services that any and all satellites provide to
society around the globe.
In response to this threat, President Biden has directed a
series of actions to respond, including direct engagement with
Russia and with countries around the world who have interests
at stake. We are applying a similar approach to promoting norms
of responsible behavior by working with countries around the
world for the use of artificial intelligence and military
applications.
In February, in close coordination with the Department of
Defense, we successfully launched a political declaration,
Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and
Autonomy, a major step forward furthering international norms
around responsible, stabilizing, and beneficial use of these
technologies.
In conclusion, diplomacy lies at the core of all these
efforts. Deterring our adversaries, curbing the risk of
miscalculation and misunderstanding, assuring allies that U.S.
extended deterrence is strong and credible, and deepening
international norms around the responsible use of immersion
technologies.
The State Department remains staunchly committed to
upholding strategic stability and using the mutually
reinforcing tools of arms control and deterrence to safeguard
U.S. and Allied security. We recognize this is a challenging
international security environment, which is precisely why we
need these tools and your bipartisan support. I look forward to
continuing to work closely with this committee, with your
colleagues across Capitol Hill to advance these objectives.
Thank you very much.

Prepared Statement of Ms. Bonnie D. Jenkins
Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Risch, distinguished Members of the
Committee: thank you for the opportunity to testify about the future of
arms control and deterrence.
We at the State Department, together with our interagency
colleagues, work to mitigate international security risks and advance
U.S. and allied interests. As the Under Secretary of State for Arms
Control and International Security, I want to emphasize that the global
security architecture is under strain. In response to these pressures,
the three bureaus that I oversee are applying a mix of tools in clear-
sighted and innovative ways to uphold strategic stability.
One tool is deterrence, including building U.S. capabilities and
that of our allies and partners. In Europe, we are working to get
Ukraine the support it needs today with an eye toward its future in the
Euro-Atlantic Region, as well as working to reinforce NATO's Eastern
Flank and welcoming our new Allies in Finland and Sweden. In the Indo-
Pacific, we are building on long-standing alliances, redoubling our
support for Taiwan's defense in the face of an increasingly aggressive
People's Republic of China (PRC), and developing new partnerships, like
Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS), to strengthen regional
security. In the Middle East, we are working aggressively to achieve a
ceasefire in Gaza that secures the release of Israeli hostages and
allows for a surge in humanitarian aid to the Palestinians. We are also
deepening robust partnerships in the Gulf region to counter threats
from Iran. In Africa as well as in the Americas, we face new security
challenges from Russia and the PRC but benefit from decades-long
security cooperation partnerships that for many countries still makes
the United States their partner of choice. The tools of the bureaus
that I lead help to support this Administration's deterrence policies
in this changing security environment, and I am proud of the innovative
approaches my bureaus have taken to meeting this moment.
A key component of deterrence is our nuclear posture. The 2022
Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) reaffirms our continuing commitment to a
safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent for the United States, as
well as our NATO Allies and Indo-Pacific allies and partners.
But reliance on deterrence alone will not solve the various
security challenges we face. As the NPR lays out, arms control
complements deterrence, and both are essential to strategic stability.
Arms control and risk reduction can avoid wasteful arms races,
establish guardrails for strategic competition, mitigate crisis
instability, and--should deterrence fail--help control escalation and
mutually limit the destructive potential of conflict.
Thank you for the invitation to address these topics here today. My
opening testimony will address how the State Department, particularly
the bureaus under my responsibility, is using tools like arms control
and risk reduction to preserve strategic stability and secure U.S. and
allied interests. These bureaus do far more than this, with
responsibilities ranging from promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear
energy to peace operations capacity building. I will focus on arms
control and deterrence in my opening remarks, and am happy to discuss
other issues in response to your questions.
I want to begin by providing some context. We are witnessing a
Russia that continues its war against Ukraine, routinely employs
irresponsible nuclear rhetoric, and has violated many of its treaty
obligations. At the same time, the PRC is undertaking a rapid and
opaque nuclear weapons build up and is pursuing a larger and more
diverse nuclear arsenal that calls into question its stated intentions
and strategy. Meanwhile, the emergence of new technologies such as
artificial intelligence simultaneously offers benefits while
introducing potential threats. All these developments increase risks of
arms racing and conflict stemming from miscalculation or misperception.
While challenging, this dynamic security environment also presents
opportunities to demonstrate U.S. leadership in promoting stability.
For decades, through hard work with allies, partners, and adversaries
alike, we have developed tools to limit these dangers. We have used
arms control measures and agreements to impose constraints on states,
prevent dangerous arms races, and reduce the risk of nuclear conflict.
We have developed a range of multilateral agreements enshrining legally
binding restrictions pertaining to many types of weapons of mass
destruction--not just nuclear arms, but also chemical, biological, and
soon, we hope, radiological weapons. Arms control instruments and
institutions have provided transparency, accountability, and
predictability within the international security environment and the
vast majority of countries abide by their obligations.
The State Department also recognizes that arms control is more than
just legally binding agreements. It also includes risk reduction tools,
such as facilitating crisis communications, providing missile launch
notifications, and building norms of responsible behavior. All these
tools make the international community more stable and more secure.
They give us a foundation for our criticism of the PRC's refusal to
engage on substantive nuclear risk reduction measures amid its rapid
and opaque nuclear weapons build up and strengthen our case to the
international community that Beijing is not acting as a responsible
nuclear power. Their existence and widespread support also strengthen
our ability to rally the international community when countries like
Russia violate obligations or disregard commitments.
In the face of this increasingly complex security environment, we
are pragmatic about what we can achieve--and remain confident that arms
control is a critical means to reduce risk and enhance stability.
russia
First, as it relates to Russia, the United States is working to
preserve strategic stability while holding Russia accountable for its
irresponsible behavior and malign influence. This includes Russia's
violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, where we assess Russia
has used the choking agent chloropicrin and riot control agents as a
method of warfare against Ukrainian forces. The United States is
working to strengthen the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons, build national response capacity, and pursue accountability
for such violations. On the conventional weapons side, the United
States and our NATO Allies condemned Russia's withdrawal from the
Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) and the United
States and NATO Allied CFE States Parties (22 in total) suspended all
of our CFE Treaty obligations, consistent with our rights under
international law.
We are also holding Moscow responsible for its legally invalid
purported suspension of the New START Treaty. In the annual treaty
implementation report that we provided to this committee in January,
the United States found Russia in non-compliance with several of its
Treaty obligations, some for a second year in a row. In 2023, in
response to Russian violations, we adopted proportionate and reversible
countermeasures which are fully consistent with international law,
aimed to induce Russia's return to full compliance with the treaty, and
ensured that Russia derives no advantages from its violations.
In less than 2 years, New START, our last remaining bilateral
nuclear arms control agreement with Russia, will expire under its
terms. We have expressed our readiness to work with Moscow on managing
nuclear risk and developing a mutually acceptable future arms control
framework that advances U.S. and allied interests. After all, no one--
including Russia--benefits from an unconstrained security environment.
Russia, however, has shown no interest in good faith engagement on
these issues. This irresponsible approach risks jeopardizing a key
pillar of global nuclear stability. We are calling on all states to
join us in urging Russia to return to full implementation of its
existing obligations and engage in discussions on managing nuclear risk
and a treaty to follow New START.
Russia continues to condition engagement on arms control on the
United States ending its support for Ukraine against Russia's invasion.
Let me be clear: Russia's reckless attempts to hold bilateral nuclear
arms control hostage will not diminish our steadfast support for
Ukraine and European security. We will continue to work with our Allies
and partners to support Ukraine's self-defense against Russian
aggression. In close partnership with DoD, we have provided more than
$50 billion in support for Ukraine's defense since February 2022, and
thanks to strong bipartisan support in the passage of the National
Security Supplemental, we will continue to stand with more than 50
countries, united with Ukraine.
We are under no illusion that the road ahead will be
straightforward. After all, managing our nuclear competition with
Russia has never been an easy task, and today may be the most
challenging it has ever been. But rest assured, we will continue our
close coordination with allies and partners to ensure Russia gains no
advantage from its irresponsible actions. While we remain committed to
pursuing responsible nuclear arms control measures, we must prepare for
all eventualities, including ways to address a potential world without
strategic nuclear arms control.
the prc
Let me now to turn to the issue of the PRC. The 2023 China Military
Power report estimates that the PRC possesses more than 500 operational
nuclear warheads and will probably have more than 1,000 operational
nuclear warheads by 2030. Beijing's development of a larger, more
diverse nuclear arsenal is deeply concerning, and raises questions
about the trajectory of the PRC's nuclear weapons program, its evolving
nuclear posture, and its strategic goals. This opacity reduces
predictability, increasing the risk of unintended escalation as well as
undesirable, costly arms races.
In addition to these risks, the PRC's nuclear weapons expansion
raises the specter that the United States may soon face two
expansionary and significantly nuclear-armed peers. As this dynamic
evolves, the United States must continue to ensure a safe, secure, and
effective nuclear deterrent, as well as a strong and credible extended
deterrence, to safeguard U.S. and allied interests. At the same time,
we must manage those deterrence relationships responsibly by pursuing
risk reduction and arms control measures. This helps our security, our
allies' security, and can help make the world a safer place.
Last November, a Department of State-led interagency delegation met
with the PRC on issues related to arms control and nonproliferation,
including risk reduction. The meeting enabled a preliminary discussion
on potential measures for managing and reducing risks with the PRC
across multiple domains, including nuclear and outer space.
Unfortunately, the PRC has declined a follow-on meeting and has not
provided a substantive response to the risk reduction suggestions we
put forward. We will continue to increase diplomatic pressure on the
PRC to increase transparency of its nuclear arsenal and to
constructively work with the United States to advance concrete measures
that reduce the risk of unintended escalation or conflict and help
manage competition responsibly, as the world expects us to do. We are
focused on achieving results, but we should all understand, that
progress will not come easily or immediately.
In the face of the PRC's nuclear weapons build up, as well as the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) expanding nuclear and
missile forces, the State Department is working to strengthen the
United States' extended deterrence relationships with key allies in the
Indo-Pacific. The U.S. commitment to strengthening extended deterrence
with the Republic of Korea, Japan, and Australia is steadfast and
enduring. Together with the DoD, the State Department leads frequent
consultations with these allies, through which we sharpen and
coordinate our full suite of tools--diplomatic, informational,
military, and economic--to promote stability in the Indo-Pacific. In
addition to these extended deterrence dialogues, we support our allies
and partners in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond by bolstering their
conventional capabilities via our long-standing security assistance
programs. Be it the Republic of Korea, Japan, Taiwan, or the
Philippines, we continue to ensure stability in the region by investing
in our allies and partners' capabilities to defend themselves.
multilateral nuclear issues
The United States is promoting strategic stability in multilateral
fora, as well. The United States continues to advocate for concrete
risk reduction measures to enhance transparency and stability among the
P5 countries, the five recognized nuclear-weapon states under the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). These measures include
establishing crisis communications channels; sharing ballistic missile
launch notifications; and committing to maintain a ``human in the
loop'' for command, control, and employment of nuclear weapons. The P3
already support maintaining human control and involvement for all
actions critical to informing and executing sovereign decisions
concerning nuclear weapons employment and we strongly believe that
Russia and the PRC should join us in this commitment. We are also
working with partners in the NPT review process to reinforce the NPT as
the foundation of efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation and nuclear
war, as well as to explain our responsible nuclear posture and increase
pressure on Russia and the PRC to be more transparent and to engage in
strategic dialogue, risk reduction, and arms control. The United States
has also long supported nuclear-weapon-free zone (NWFZ) treaties as a
complement to the global Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and a
means for extending certain legally binding assurances against the use
or threat of use of nuclear weapons. We would urge the Senate to ratify
those protocols previously signed and submitted for advice and consent.
Meanwhile, the United States continues to demonstrate leadership in
the multilateral international security arena. We urge states to join
us in building off the momentum generated last year in the U.N. General
Assembly, which overwhelmingly adopted a U.S.-sponsored resolution
calling for negotiation of a ban on state use of radiological weapons.
We will pursue those negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament. We
will continue to pursue the negotiation of a Fissile Material Cut-off
Treaty (FMCT) on the basis of the Shannon Mandate (CD/1299), which is
more important than ever with the PRC's build up of nuclear weapon and
fissile material production capabilities. Until an FMCT enters into
force, we will coordinate with international partners to continue to
press for the PRC, as the only Nuclear Weapon State that has not yet
done so, to declare a moratorium on the production of fissile material
for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.
outer space
In the outer space domain, the United States is upholding existing
obligations and developing and advancing proposals for responsible
international behavior, in contrast to hypocritical proposals and
dangerous behavior from Russia and the PRC. For almost 60 years, the
Outer Space Treaty and its prohibition on the placement of nuclear
weapons in outer space have been the foundational element of the
international legal framework. Today, that regime is under threat. As
we have noted previously, the Administration assesses that Russia is
developing a new satellite carrying a nuclear device. Placement by a
State Party to the Outer Space Treaty of a nuclear weapon in orbit
would not only violate the treaty, but also threaten the satellites
operated by countries and companies around the globe, as well as to the
vital communications, scientific, meteorological, agricultural,
commercial, and national security services we all depend upon.
In response to this threat, President Biden has directed a series
of actions, including direct engagement with Russia and with several
other key countries around the world. Additionally, the United States
and Japan, with more than 60 co-sponsors, proposed a U.N. Security
Council resolution that would have reaffirmed the fundamental
obligation of states Parties to the Outer Space Treaty not to place
nuclear weapons or other kinds of weapons of mass destruction in orbit
around the Earth. Unfortunately, Russia vetoed this resolution, which
should have been uncontroversial. We have heard President Putin say
publicly that Russia has no intention of deploying nuclear weapons in
space. If that were the case, Russia would not have vetoed this
resolution. Doing so raises serious questions as to its commitment to
complying with its legally binding obligations under the Outer Space
Treaty.
Because this issue is critical to U.S. national security, and the
security of all states, we will continue using our diplomatic tools to
raise this issue bilaterally, in the United Nations, and in other
appropriate multilateral fora until Russia provides credible assurances
that they have ceased these efforts. The United States has already
begun considering approaches to help ensure that countries cannot
deploy nuclear weapons in orbit undetected, and we intend to engage
with other states parties as our ideas evolve.
We also intend to continue our important work on norms of
responsible behavior in outer space, which the United States has been a
leader in developing. We have proposed concrete measures in this arena,
including our commitment not to conduct destructive, direct-ascent
anti-satellite missile tests, as first stated by Vice President Harris
in 2022, and to which 37 other countries have now made national
commitments. We have also worked within the U.N. to successfully adopt
a resolution calling on states to make the same pledge, with the
overwhelming support of 155 countries for this resolution, and will
continue to support such efforts that enhance space stability and
security.
emerging technology
We are applying a similar approach to promoting norms of
responsible behavior for the use of artificial intelligence in military
applications. In February, in close coordination with the Defense
Department, we successfully launched the Political Declaration on
Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy--a
major step toward furthering international norms around the
responsible, stabilizing, and beneficial use of these technologies.
Fifty-five states have already endorsed the Declaration, which
articulates ten foundational responsible practices for military
development and deployment of AI and autonomy. Building a consensus
around these norms and practices to manage the potential risks of AI
while harnessing the technology's benefits will improve predictability
and stability in the international security environment.
Meanwhile, the United States continues to advance efforts to
enhance collaboration with partners and allies around the world while
upholding high security standards, including through efforts to
increase efficiencies in our systems. Thanks to action by the U.S.
Congress, we are implementing authorities related to export control
exemptions with Australia and the UK as part of AUKUS.
conclusion
In conclusion, diplomacy lies at the core of all these efforts--
deterring our adversaries, ensuring they understand our resolve to
defend our country and our allies, curbing the risk of miscalculation
and misunderstanding, contributing to shared goals of nonproliferation,
assuring allies that U.S. extended deterrence is strong and credible,
and deepening international norms around the responsible use of
emerging technologies.
The State Department remains staunchly committed to upholding
strategic stability and using the mutually reinforcing tools of arms
control and deterrence to safeguard U.S. and allied security. We
recognize this is a challenging international security environment--
which is precisely why we need these tools. Few objectives are as
critical as reducing the risk of nuclear war and preventing costly arms
races, and few objectives demand more bipartisan action. I look forward
to continuing to work closely with this Committee and with your
colleagues across Capitol Hill to advance these objectives.
Thank you.
The Chairman. Well, Madam Ambassador, thank you for your
comments. Thank you for being here.
I want to start with the comment you made about Russia's
language on the potential use of nuclear weapons in regards to
its invasion of Ukraine. I want to know how the Administration
is balancing our concern about that type of language and
potential of having a nuclear confrontation versus making it
clear that it will not deter our support for Ukraine's right to
defend itself and our partnership with Ukraine.
So how do you balance those two concerns, their challenge
in regards to the use of nuclear weapons versus our commitment
to help the people of Ukraine?
Ms. Jenkins. Thank you very much for your question,
Senator.
First, I want to make it very clear that our commitment to
Ukraine is--we are very committed to it. It is ironclad, as you
have seen from all of the efforts that we have gone through in
terms of providing them with the equipment that they need, and
our continuing efforts to do that until they have achieved
other goals and success.
So that is, actually, an important question that you asked
because very often, and what we have seen in forums, is that
Russia has used our commitment to Ukraine to be at a way in
which they have not been as cooperative as they need to be.
We continue to inform them about the importance of the New
START Treaty, the irresponsible rhetoric that they use, how
that does not promote international security. In fact, it is
quite the opposite, and why they need to come back to the table
to continue to implement the New START Treaty completely, and
to also come back to the table so we can start discussing what
happens after the treaty ends in 2026.
So that is how we balance it. Our commitment to Ukraine
will continue, but we also want to engage and make sure that
Russia stops this nuclear rhetoric, but also comes back to the
table.
The Chairman. There are other nuclear powers that are out
there that are just as concerned as the United States should be
as to the language used by Mr. Putin. Have we engaged PRC, or
India, or other countries that would have a strong interest to
make sure that nuclear weapons are not used in Ukraine?
Ms. Jenkins. Yes, we have. This is a topic that I often
bring up in my bilateral discussions, which are many, whether
it is at NATO, whether it is in my conversations that I have
with the PRC.
I would also want to highlight that in fact, quite a few
countries are very supportive of our engagement with Russia to
get back to the table to discuss what will happen after 2026,
and to make sure that we fully implement the New START Treaty
because they are very concerned about Russian nuclear rhetoric.
They are very concerned about the possibility of us not having
an arms control treaty because they see it very much in the
global security interest despite what is happening in Ukraine.
So, we have quite a bit of support for what we are doing
from the international community, despite our anger at Russia,
which is valid, but we continue to have these conversations
because all countries are concerned about it.
The Chairman. So, Russia has suspended its participation in
New START, but as we understand it, they are living up to the
limits that were established by the treaty. Is there room here
for a political agreement between the United States and Russia
in regards to moving forward with some understanding on nuclear
proliferation?
Ms. Jenkins. Yes, thank you for the question.
Yes, Russia is committed to--at least, they have said that
they are going to be committed to the treaty limits, which they
are, which we assess that they continue to be. And we do also,
going to staying within the limits as well. So that is
something that we are committed to as long as this treaty--as
long as they are.
But we are also having interagency discussions. One of my
bureaus is actually leading an interagency discussion to think
about what is going to happen if in fact we are not able to get
back to the table by 2026 and what that will look like. So, we
are considering that. We are thinking about that, but at the
same time, between now and then, February 2026, we want to
continue our efforts to try to bring them back to the table.
The Chairman. So, I know there has been some conversations
between the United States and PRC in regards to nuclear
nonproliferation. Can you just give us the status, quickly, as
to how those discussions are taking place, and whether you
expect other continued high level conversations with PRC in
regards to nuclear proliferation?
Ms. Jenkins. Thank you for the question.
Yes. As I mentioned, we did have our dialogue with them in
November of last year, and it was an opportunity to highlight
some of our concerns, some of the things that we feel a
responsible nuclear weapons state should do, which is to have
these kind of conversations, bilateral discussions, to try to
get rid of any misperceptions and reduce the chance of
misperceptions about why they are building up their nuclear
weapons.
We provided them a paper that we think highlights some of
the areas that we can do in terms of crisis management and risk
reduction, the ways we can continue to work together. To date,
we have not received a response from the PRC on that, but our
goal is to continue to try to see if we can bring them to the
table.
The Chairman. Are there any future meetings set at this
stage?
Ms. Jenkins. There is no meeting set right now for the PRC.
The Chairman. Are you anticipating that there will be that
opportunity for more meetings?
Ms. Jenkins. As I said, we are always hoping that we will
have those meetings. We make it very clear. When I have
bilateral opportunities to discuss issues with them, or we let
them know our goal is to have a sustained discussion on the
issues of their developing of nuclear weapons, the things we
are concerned about that are in our national security
interests, and why it is in their interest to also have these
discussions to bring some more transparency and openness to
what they are doing in terms of building up their nuclear
weapons.
The Chairman. But if I understand you, we are waiting for
China to respond?
Ms. Jenkins. At this point, yes. We have made it very
clear. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, also in his
speech last year, made it very clear we are ready to talk.
The Chairman. Senator Risch.
Senator Risch. I am sitting here in shock, actually.
Ma'am, let me give you a message from our allies that you
apparently are not listening to. You actually sit here and are
willing to tell this committee you think the Russians are going
to return to the table to negotiate on the New START Treaty? Is
that what you are telling this committee?
Ms. Jenkins. Thank you for your question.
Senator Risch. And you do not have to thank me for the
question, just to answer it.
Ms. Jenkins. Put it this way, we want them to come back to
the table, and we make----
Senator Risch. I hear that. Do you think they are going to
come back to the table? Ma'am, you are living in la-la land.
They are not coming back to the table. They invaded Ukraine.
They hate us. They fed us at every turn. They are not coming
back to the table.
The only way they would come back to the table is if they
think they can snooker us again, enter into such a treaty, and
then violate it and cheat on it like they did throughout the
history of START and New START. You actually think you are
going to get them back to the table to get a bonafide agreement
with Russia? Is that what you are telling this committee?
Ms. Jenkins. Once again, I am saying that that is our goal.
Is to try to get them back to the table.
Senator Risch. That was not the question. Not what your
goal is. The question is, do you sitting here as the expert and
as the person in charge of this for the United States of
America, Moscow is listening to you right now, do you think
they are going to come back to the table?
Ms. Jenkins. Well, all I can go by is what we have done in
the past. And in the past, they have come to the table, and
some of the times it was very challenging. Even during the cold
war, we had conversations. We were able to talk.
Senator Risch. So, as the expert, how long do you think it
is going to take for them to sit around and say, ``I guess we
will go back to the table and talk to our friends in the United
States''? How long till that happens, do you think?
Ms. Jenkins. I honestly cannot give you an estimate exactly
how long it is going to take them, because I do not know. All I
can say is we really want to----
Senator Risch. I can. It is going to be never. You guys are
dreaming over there if this is what you are waiting for. The
next thing you answered the question to the Chairman on is you
are waiting for a response from the Chinese to talk some more
about nuclear weapons control. Is that your response?
Ms. Jenkins. We provided them with some papers, and we have
had some conversations. And yes, the ball is in their court
right now.
Senator Risch. Yes. How long you been waiting?
Ms. Jenkins. We provided them the paper in November.
Senator Risch. You have heard anything since November?
Ms. Jenkins. No, we have not heard anything.
Senator Risch. OK. Not surprising. When do you think you
are going to hear from them?
Ms. Jenkins. Once again, sir, I cannot predict when we will
hear from them. I can only say that as a responsible nuclear
weapon state, we need to keep making this effort. And in fact,
the international community wants to see us have these
conversations because they are very concerned about the
situation, and I can tell you that in conversations that I have
had with our partners and allies.
Senator Risch. We are all full of hope. But unfortunately,
the history that we have had with these two countries is very,
very discouraging.
Let me ask you. As far as the Chinese are concerned, I
assume--let us not get into classified stuff. You see the same
classified stuff I do, but just open source reporting. Are you
encouraged by what China is doing and the developments of not
only its nuclear weapons, but just as importantly, if not more
importantly, the nuclear delivery systems for those weapons
such as underwater, such as supersonic?
You have seen these things in the media, have you not?
Ms. Jenkins. Yes, I have.
Senator Risch. Is this encouraging to you?
Ms. Jenkins. I would not say we are--encouraging. I would
say concerned.
Senator Risch. I think we are concerned.
Ms. Jenkins. Yes.
Senator Risch. Is that an indication to you that they are
planning on coming to the table and talking to you about these
kinds of things?
Ms. Jenkins. As I said, when we go to the table with the
Chinese and the PRC, one of our efforts is to try to get us to
the table so we can talk about some of these issues.
Senator Risch. Well, thank you very much.
Mr. Chairman, let me just conclude by saying I am really
disappointed in what I have heard today. These people are
sitting around waiting for these things to happen, and it is a
dream world to live in. It is la-la land. It is ludicrous.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The Chairman. Before I call on Senator Murphy, let me say I
share your frustration about Russia and PRC. But we are all
citizens of the world, and we all have to do everything we can
to encourage communication among nuclear power states so that
we have reasonable guardrails in place, including treaties, I
hope, and we should never stop an opportunity for conversations
to make the world a little bit safer.
Senator Murphy.
Senator Murphy. Yes. Thank you very much Mr. Chairman.
I appreciate those comments. Listen, we do not have any
choice, but to have a policy in which we hope to be able to
create the foundation for positive engagement with countries
with nuclear programs. That may not be realistic in the short
term, but it would be foolhardy in a nuclear age to abandon
that prospect.
So, I understand it is a difficult dialogue because this is
a very dire moment, but it is incredibly important for us to
understand that whether it be in the medium term or long term,
that dialogue is still very, very important even with our
adversaries.
Now, Madam Secretary, I wanted to talk to you about the
future of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East. In
particular, I want to talk to you about the demands reported in
the press that Saudi Arabia has made of the United States. What
they have told us is that if there is to be a normalization
deal with Israel, that we all root for, they would want, as a
key tenant of that deal, the ability to develop a civilian
nuclear program inside Saudi Arabia.
A number of us have written to the Administration to make
clear that we believe any agreement would impose and involve
what we call the gold standard 123 agreement and the additional
protocol. Nonetheless, Saudi officials have insisted that a
deal must include the U.S. construction of a uranium enrichment
facility inside its territory.
So let me ask you this. Would the construction of an
enrichment facility inside Saudi Arabia as currently stipulated
and requested by Saudi officials as an element of a potential
normalization deal with Israel, be detrimental to our
nonproliferation objectives in the region?
Ms. Jenkins. Yes, thank you for the question.
And just very briefly on the previous one, just want to--
one thing, I also want to make clear that while we are also
doing our job to make sure that there is diplomatic engagement,
we also have a whole of government approach, which is also the
deterrent side, which I am not going to necessarily go into.
But we keep track of all these things of both diplomacy and
deterrence. Two sides of the same coin.
Thank you very much for your question, Senator Murphy. We
have had discussions with Saudi Arabia for many years, actually
for several years, in terms of a 123 agreement, something that,
you know, we have been engaged with them off and on.
And of course, you know, finding ways that we can promote
stability in the Middle East relationship with Israel and other
countries in the Middle East is very paramount to us. So, we
continue to have conversations with Saudi Arabia on this issue.
Unfortunately, I cannot get into all the details about the
discussions of what is happening on that issue, but I can say
that we continue to have these conversations with them on a
potential 123 agreement.
Senator Murphy. Well, let me ask you the question this way,
then. If Saudi Arabia were to have the ability to do domestic
enrichment, what would be the impact of that decision in the
context of a normalization agreement on other allies in the
region?
I mean, it stands to reason that if Saudi Arabia does not
have the gold standard applied, and they are able to do
domestic enrichment, then the UAE will want that ability. Qatar
will want that ability, and it will impact Iran's
decisionmaking as well.
Is there not clearly a ripple effect in the region if we do
not require the application of the gold standard in an
agreement with Saudi Arabia?
Ms. Jenkins. Yes. What I can say, and there is not much I
can go into in detail, but what I can say is when we are in
these conversations that we have, we do look at the regional
context, and we do look at, as we do in all these situations,
look at decisions that we make and how it can be affected
within the regions, and how other countries will interpret it.
I cannot really go into any more detail than that,
unfortunately.
Senator Murphy. Well, but I mean, is it not just common
sense? I mean, you cannot say on the record that if Saudi
Arabia has the ability to domestically enrich that would impact
the desire of other countries in the region to be able to
domestically enrich? They are not just going to stand down and
allow for Saudi Arabia to have a deal with the United States
that they do not have.
Ms. Jenkins. Yes, I mean, what I can say is, as you are
saying, is that is certainly something that we are considering
and we are thinking about in terms of what we are working on
with Saudi Arabia, and how any decisions that we make with them
will impact other countries in the region, and how they are
looking at the situation.
Senator Murphy. Have you seen any evidence that Saudi
Arabia is taking steps toward developing enrichment
capabilities outside of an agreement with the United States?
Ms. Jenkins. I will have to get back to you on that because
I am not aware of any, but I cannot say that that is not the
case.
Senator Murphy. OK. I think it would be more constructive
for us to have a bit more of an open conversation about this
incredibly vital issue. I mean, I think you are punting the
discussion around the details, but everybody knows this
discussion is happening between the United States and Saudi
Arabia about a potential major new enrichment capability for
the Saudis.
I do not think it is helpful to not be able to have an open
non-classified debate about that inside of this committee, and
I hope this committee will continue to pursue that dialogue
with the Administration. I do not think it is helpful to
withhold any level of detail about those conversations, which
are very real and active.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Ms. Jenkins. Yes, I understand, and I will certainly take
that back.
The Chairman. And if we need to be in a SCIF----
Ms. Jenkins. Yes.
The Chairman . We will have those conversations
in a SCIF.
Senator Barrasso.
Senator Barrasso. Well, thanks, Mr. Chairman.
Let me just say, I agree with Senator Murphy and the
comments that he just made. I think we ought to get answers to
these questions. These are legitimate questions to be answered,
and the Administration ought to answer the question. So, thank
you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to Senator Murphy as well.
I wanted to talk about cutting off arms to Israel. Israel
is one of our nation's closest allies. On October 7, Hamas
brutally murdered men, women, and children in Israel. I have
seen the videos. American citizens were among the individuals
killed, injured, kidnapped, and held hostage. The death and
destruction of these terrorists is shocking. Hamas continues to
hide in populated areas. Hamas continues to use civilians as
human shields. With the serious threats in the region, I think
it is more important than ever for Israel to quickly receive
everything it needs to defend itself, to eliminate Hamas. Yet
the Biden administration is doing the complete opposite at this
point.
Last week, President Biden announced he was cutting off
shipments of ammunition and weapons to Israel. I want to be
clear: This is happening while one of our strongest allies in
the Middle East is at war with terrorists, murderers. The
people of Israel deserve a partner and a friend that it can
trust, not one that leaves in the face of terrorism and
terrorists alone. The Administration should be ashamed, I
believe, of its actions. These are the weapons Israel needs to
defeat Hamas, to defend its people against additional attacks
from Iran, and from its proxies.
Last week, 48 U.S. Senators introduced a resolution
condemning the decision by the Biden administration. We must be
taking every step possible to expedite the delivery of these
important weapons.

The Chairman. The Senator will suspend.
Senator Barrasso.
Senator Barrasso. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
As I was saying, the people of Israel deserve a partner and
a friend that it can trust, not one that leaves it to face
terrorists alone. I think that the Administration should be
ashamed of its actions, and they are weapons Israel needs to
defeat Hamas, and defend its people against additional attacks
from Iran and its proxies.
So last week, 48 U.S. Senators introduced a resolution
condemning the decision by the Biden administration. I think we
must be taking every step possible to expedite the delivery of
these important weapons, not putting up new barriers and
obstacles in the way.
So, do you support the U.S. blocking weapons from going to
Israel?
Ms. Jenkins. Thank you, Senator, for your question.
Just want to say from the very beginning that our support
to Israel is ironclad. And this Administration has shown its
strong support in very many ways, including President Biden
being the first President to be in Israel during a wartime
situation. All the support that we have provided to Israel at
the U.N.
Thanks for the bipartisan support for the appropriations
that you were able to provide for us to continue to give
weapons to Israel. And of course, we are very concerned about
the loss of life by Hamas and what they have done in Israel,
but also by the loss of life by the Palestinians who are also
caught up in this war. And as you may know, there have been
conversations that President Biden has had with Israel about
the situation in Rafah.
And the concern that we have with just about the particular
bombs that were going to go there, the 2,000 pound bombs that
we had already notified and we had informed Israel that, you
know, going into Rafah could result in us not providing some
weapons to them.
Today, as you probably know, we have put in review $1
billion worth of equipment to go to Israel. That was a pause.
We are still considering the situation there, and we continue
to work with Israel and have conversations with them on these
issues on a regular basis.
But I just want to highlight that we will continue to
provide Israel with all of the funding that you have provided
us in the supplemental. And as I noted, we have provided them
today with the $1 billion.
Senator Barrasso. And my concerns are that there are other
countries looking in on this as well. And if they say, well,
how can we expect us to be good partners with them if at this
time we are withholding weapons?
So, the question is, given recent reports of the
Administration asking for approval from Congress for a new arms
shipment, you know, why is the Administration holding up
weapons now? This is something that was just approved.
Ms. Jenkins. Thank you, again.
As I said that these are, these are specific weapons that
we have concerns about, the loss of civilians that could be if
these bombs are used. But as I said, we are continuing to
provide Israel with arms. We will make sure they get all the
arms that you have been appropriating to us, and we will
continue to.
Senator Barrasso. One more question. But my follow up to
that would be that, I mean, some of these bombs are to get to
the fact that these tunnels are so far underground, and that is
used as a hiding place by the Hamas. And we have seen that, and
I think there is been a surprise to many the extent of the
tunnels and the depth of the tunnels, and that the attention of
some of these armaments are to get specifically to that.
But I just want to ask a quick question on China. So,
during your confirmation process, you committed to me in
writing that you would work with U.S. allies and partners to
urge Beijing to engage meaningfully with the United States on
arms control.
The 2022 Nuclear Posture Review said China has embarked on
an ambitious expansion, modernization, diversification of its
nuclear forces, of which you are well aware. It went on to say
that by China expanding its nuclear options, it could allow for
them to include nuclear coercion, limited nuclear first use in
their employment strategy.
Can you share with the committee how many engagements you
actually have had with the Chinese officials, specifically, on
their nuclear weapons ambitions and expansion?
Ms. Jenkins. Thanks for your question.
I can go back and think about the exact times. I mean, we
had the official engagement in November. I have met with
individuals several times on the margins of other meetings that
I have been to. Same with other colleagues in my bureaus. So,
we have had conversations. What we are looking for is a
sustained dialogue that we can count on, on a regular basis.
That is what we are really looking for.
Senator Barrasso. It sounds like we are not having that at
this point.
Ms. Jenkins. Excuse me?
Senator Barrasso. It sounds like that is not going well at
this point, based on their decisions. Probably not your
decision.
Ms. Jenkins. Right. It is not happening at this point, but
we need to keep trying to make it happen.
Senator Barrasso. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The Chairman. Senator Van Hollen.
Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Welcome, Madam Under Secretary Jenkins.
And I had not planned to ask you about the situation in
Israel and Gaza, but just a few points since it was just
raised. As you indicated, President Biden has from the very
beginning made clear that the United States stands with Israel
in its own defense, and has been there throughout this period
of time.
The President has also raised concerns about the
humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Over 2 million people there who
have nothing to do with Hamas, under enormous stress and
humanitarian challenges, including starvation. And the
President has also made clear that he believes an invasion of
Rafah would be counterproductive. That it would not advance the
priority of returning hostages safely. That it would worsen an
already terrible humanitarian crisis, and that it would cause
very high levels of civilian casualties.
So, I was pleased to see the President's decision to say
that we are not going to provide 2,000 pound bombs and other
munitions that could lead to those bad outcomes. And you would
hope that the Netanyahu government recognizing the strong
support the President has showed for Israel would be more
willing to listen to a partner.
And the reality is this committee establishes requirements
for U.S. military assistance in many cases with our partners.
And that makes sense, because American support should not take
the form of a blank check.
Let me now turn to the issues that I plan to focus on with
respect to nuclear arms control. As you know, the 2022 Nuclear
Posture Review opposes a No First Use policy. In fact, it says
that no first use, ``would result in unacceptable risk.''
I disagree with that statement. The President, when he was
a candidate for office, supported a No First Use policy. And as
you know we have been trying to engage China in discussions
with respect to nuclear weapons. And in November 2023--excuse
me, in February of this year, China indicated that it may be
open to negotiating a No First Use treaty with nuclear weapon
states.
Could you just speak to the pros and cons of pursuing that
kind of opening from China?
Ms. Jenkins. Yes, thank you for the question.
Yes, we were made aware of this proposal by the PRC, and
this was really the first time we had heard that from them. And
I can say, again, this is why it is important to have these
kinds of discussions with them because then we can talk about
what they mean by this no first use.
Our questions are, quite frankly, how does an idea for no
first use really fit within their ongoing process of building
up nuclear weapons? And how sincere are they to this policy
that they are saying, as you noted, we do not have a No First
Use policy at this point. And of course, you know, we have our
policy of not using weapons first on countries who abide by the
nuclear nonproliferation treaty.
But the proposal was one that, you know, we had not had a
conversation with them about, we did not know about. And so, we
just have questions. We have questions about it when we are
looking at what they are actually doing in terms of building up
their nuclear arsenal and building up their military
capabilities.
Senator Van Hollen. So, Madam Under Secretary, just to be
clear, so you have not ruled out the idea of discussing with
China the possibility of a mutual No First Use policy as part
of an overall negotiation with respect to nuclear weapons?
Ms. Jenkins. What I will say is we stand by what we put
into the NPR. So, we are not changing that right now. So just
want to make that very clear. And what I am saying is that we
had not heard anything about this, so we would have to take it
back, and think about it within the interagency. But we are
not, at this point, entertaining the idea, and we are not
changing our policy right now.
Senator Van Hollen. Well, I hope you will at least enter
into more of a dialogue with China. I mean, as you have said,
as others have said, it is been disappointing that they have
refused to engage when it comes to nuclear arms control
discussions. This seems to be at least an opening for greater
discussion if the United States were willing to pursue it.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Ms. Jenkins. Thank you.
The Chairman. Thank you.
Senator Risch.
Senator Risch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
A couple times here, you used the term that, ``our
commitment to Israel was ironclad.'' And is that the words you
are told to use by the Administration? Because everybody uses
it. Our commitment is ironclad. That is what they are telling
you.
Ms. Jenkins. I think it is a term. Yes, it is a term, I
believe----
Senator Risch. It is very good. I want to ask you about
that.
Ms. Jenkins. It is easily understood.
Senator Risch. Well, not so much as I understand it. It is
ironclad as long as they do what we tell them to do. Is that a
fair statement?
Ms. Jenkins. It is ironclad in the fact that we are
committed to providing them with what they need to achieve
their goals and achieve our goals.
Senator Risch. And as long as they do what we tell them to
do, right? Because we have told them not to do this and not to
do that. They disagreed with us. And so we have said, you
cannot have this, and you cannot have that. That sounds more
like it is wrapped in tinfoil than iron, to me.
Ms. Jenkins. It is part of the conversations. I mean, we
are talking with them on a regular basis. They were well aware
of our concern.
Senator Risch. I am not talking about the talking. I am
talking about our commitment. What is our commitment to them?
Ms. Jenkins. Our commitment is billions of dollars that we
have been giving to them for their defense. Our commitment is
supporting them at the U.N. Our commitment is working with you
in a bipartisan basis to get the funding.
Senator Risch. Do we support in their ambition to eliminate
Hamas?
Ms. Jenkins. Yes.
Senator Risch. We do?
Ms. Jenkins. Yes.
Senator Risch. And they can use the weapons that we give
them to do that.
Ms. Jenkins. Yes, they can.
Senator Risch. But we have cut off weapons.
Ms. Jenkins. We have delayed very big bombs, 2,000 pound
bombs that----
Senator Risch. Is that all we have delayed?
Ms. Jenkins. That is what we have delayed.
Senator Risch. OK. Now, you understand on that sale that
you are talking about, I signed off on that, Senator Cardin
signed off on that. Our allies across the way, both the
chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee,
signed off on that.
Is it your position that the Administration can overrule
what we did and not give them the weapons that we have signed
off to give them?
Ms. Jenkins. We are very appreciative of your signing off
on the weapons, but I think where there is conflict----
Senator Risch. Well, if you are so appreciative, why did
not you just give it to them then?
Ms. Jenkins. Because there is other considerations that we
talked about with them that we have to also think about, which
is 1.4 million people----
Senator Risch. And so, your considerations overrule our
considerations?
Ms. Jenkins. That is not what I am saying. That is not what
I am saying.
Senator Risch. Well, then what is going on here? How come
you do not do what we signed off that----
Ms. Jenkins. We appreciate that you provided us and signed
off on the weapons, but----
Senator Risch. You do not have to appreciate.
Ms. Jenkins . But we also have----
Senator Risch. We want you to do what we told you to do.
Ms. Jenkins. But we also have conversations with Israel on
a regular basis about what is happening and how we can all make
sure that they are achieving what they need to achieve, but not
in a way that in this case----
Senator Risch. Do you think you are in a better position to
determine what they need to achieve than they are in a position
to determine what to achieve?
Ms. Jenkins. That is not what I am saying, Senator.
Senator Risch. Yes, I am not getting anywhere with you.
Maybe Senator Shaheen would be able to.
The Chairman. Before recognizing Senator Shaheen. Let me
try just to explain the relationship we have between the
executive and legislative branch in regards to arm sales, but
we do not have enough time for me to go through the whole
explanation here.
It is a consultation process. There is also, of course, an
appropriation process of funds that Senator Shaheen is very
familiar with as a member of the Appropriations Committee. It
is an informal process, and then there is a formal process. So,
I appreciate the frustration of the ranking member, but I can
assure you that it is more conversational than just yes or no.
And there are nuances always in these arms sales. I have
worked with many Administrations. I have never agreed with
every decision made by any Administration since I have been in
the U.S. Senate on every issue. But I must tell you, the Biden
administration has been very open in its communications with
us, and I think respects greatly the legislative branch of
government.
And I just really want that on the record because it is
been a cooperative effort in regards to these issues, and they
have certainly shared a lot of information with us.
Senator Risch. Mr. Chairman.
The Chairman. Certainly.
Senator Risch. So, I can put on the record, also.
Apparently, you were consulted on this. I was not consulted
that they were going to withhold arms. I thought you said this
was a consultant process, and you were consulted.
The Chairman. I am saying the informal process and the
formal process as a consultation. The Administration makes
decisions. They reserve the right as to how they make their
decisions and how to notify us. But it has certainly been a
very open process, I would say more open process with this
Administration than I have had with previous Administrations,
whether it be Democrat or Republican administrations. It is
been a more open process.
Senator Risch. Well, back to this particular sale. We all
consulted, as you said, and we all agreed we would give them X
amount. And now, apparently, they are going a different
direction. But nobody, nobody came back to me and said, ``Well,
you know, we had those consultations, we have changed our
mind.''
Nobody has said anything to me. I turned on TV set. And
there it is that somebody has made a decision that countermands
the agreement that we made. That is the thing that really
troubles me on this aside from the fact that they are actually
doing it.
The Chairman. I am not so sure we have made that definitive
a decision on the delivery dates of military equipment that is
clear as you are stating it. There is, I said, actions taken by
the Biden administration that I have disagreed with. But I
think as far as working with the Congress, they have been very
open.
Senator Shaheen.
Senator Shaheen. Good morning, Ambassador Jenkins. Thank
you for being here.
I am concerned about how China views Russia's nuclear
posturing, and whether they are looking with favor on Russia
suggesting that they are going to use nuclear weapons in
Ukraine and their movement of nuclear weapons to Belarus.
Can you speak to your understanding of how they view what
Russia is doing, and then whether there are ways that we can
capitalize on any disagreements that might exist between China
and Russia on this issue?
Ms. Jenkins. Thank you, Senator, for the question.
It is hard to know exactly what China, specifically what
they view about the nuclear rhetoric that Russia has been
throwing around. Mainly, because a lack of constant
conversations that we have with them, maybe I can share. Maybe
the intel community may have more specifics on that.
But one of the things that we do make clear whenever we
have conversations with the PRC is that, you know, we make it
very clear that we all want to be responsible nuclear weapon
states. And what Russia is doing is not being a responsible
nuclear weapon state. It is not adhering to the tenets of the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
It is problematic. It is going against the norm. We make
this very clear to the Chinese as well in all the conversations
we have with them so that they--we have to make it very clear
that there are certain things that states with nuclear weapons
need to do. And what Russia is doing is not one of them.
And we want to be, at least the U.S., wants to continue to
be a responsible nuclear weapon state, which is why we make all
the efforts that we do to have these conversations with them,
to show the international community that we are doing the right
thing for ourselves, for our partners and allies, and quite
frankly, for the whole global community of nuclear weapons
concerns.
Senator Shaheen. So last month, I traveled to Seoul, and we
had a chance to meet with President Yoon. And one of the things
he talked about was the extended deterrence that the U.S. has
provided to our allies in the Indo-Pacific. And I am also
encouraged by U.S. and NATO partners' cooperation on nuclear
technology with our Indo-Pacific allies, the AUKUS Agreement,
for example.
So, can you talk about what the Administration plans are to
bring together our allies, both those in NATO and those in the
Indo-Pacific, so that we can closely coordinate and work
together on these issues?
Ms. Jenkins. Yes. You mentioned, of course, the Republic of
Korea, and we had our Washington Summits last year, and we
solidified with the South Koreans our commitment to them under
extended deterrence. We set up to do a consultative group. I
and we also have another group that I lead called the EDSEG
where we meet with the Koreans on a regular basis.
So, we wanted to strengthen extended deterrence. We wanted
to remind the South Korean public of our commitment to South
Korea. We know that they have the DPRK in the background that
is shooting off ballistic missiles. So, we want to make sure
that they understand that our commitment is certainly there.
We have also had a number of things like having a
ballistic--we had a B-52 landing there, we had a nuclear sub as
well. So, we are doing these things to make sure that they
understand our commitment to them, as well as with Japan and
Australia. AUKUS, of course, is a great collaboration between
U.S., the UK and Australia, as you mentioned.
And then at NATO, there are a number of conversations that
I am engaged in, that some of our colleagues from the
Department of Defense are engaged in on a regular basis with
them on these issues of nuclear weapons and deterrence, and
making sure that everyone we are working with, whether in
Northeast Asia, or Australia, or in NATO, sees our commitment
to all of this.
So this is a regular--I just want to highlight, these are
regular conversations we have. We have, you know, doing TTX
exercise, all kinds of things that we are doing with them.
Senator Shaheen. So, to go back to Russia, one of the
things that I think people were very concerned about was
hearing that Russia has ambitions to put a nuclear weapon in
space. Can you talk about what diplomatic efforts are underway
to try and counter that, and how we have responded to Russia?
Ms. Jenkins. Yes. Thank you for the question.
Yes, the possibility of satellite that has a nuclear device
in orbit by Russia is a great concern. It is a violation of the
Outer Space Treaty. It is, you know, putting up in space, so
that could be catastrophic to other satellites there. We saw
what happened a few years ago when Russia had a satellite
missile test, and how all the debris is still up there. We had
to move our International Space Station a couple times because
of it.
So, outer space is an area that we do not want to have
these types of nuclear devices or anything up there. So we, as
you know, probably, got together with Japan and proposed a U.N.
Security Council resolution that had 65 co-sponsors. Thirteen
of the 15 countries voted in favor of it. Russia did not, of
course, and China abstained.
Right after that, we had a meeting at the General Assembly
at the U.N. because of Russia's veto where countries had an
opportunity to talk to Russia about this and express their
concerns about this. We also had conversations with Russia
itself, and with China, and India, individually, on this issue.
And our main goal now as we continue to think,
diplomatically, how we deal with this, is to work with
countries to encourage Russia not to do this. And we will
continue to work with international forum, multilateral forums,
and working with other countries. We are also continuing our
work on norms developments, responsible behavior in space
activities that we have started already.
Senator Shaheen. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The Chairman. Senator Young, first of all, thank you for
your leadership on AI. I read your document. It gives us a
challenge moving forward and a lot of work for our committees.
You did good work.
Senator Young. Well, thank you, Chairman. I am looking
forward to the international dimension of that work here on
this committee. And in light of your very appropriate lead in,
I will be asking a question of our witness about AI. So, I
appreciate that.
Under Secretary Jenkins, the ADS Bureau at the State
Department recently hosted 60 countries for a plenary session
on the political declaration on responsible military use of
artificial intelligence and autonomy. What are the biggest
challenges to implementing this declaration?
Ms. Jenkins. Thank you for the question, and thank you for
highlighting the good work that is being done on that. One of
the things about some of the positives that is been really good
is that we, as you said, we are able to get over 160 countries
who were actually at the event. It is the first time we have
had a chance to really think about how we implement this. And
the goal, of course, is to get as many countries as possible to
join us in this way of trying to develop responsible norms and
responsible behavior in terms of AI in the military.
One of the biggest challenges, I guess, in most of these
things that we are dealing with today is making sure that we
can get as many countries as possible on it and joining it.
One thing I can say is that the event last year that was
hosted by the Netherlands and the ROK called the REAIM
Conference in February, where I announced it, the PRC did make
the statement that we need to be concerned and make sure that
there is not any misperceptions as a result of AI in the
military. So hopefully, we can continue, maybe have the PRC
join that, but of course, we want to get as many countries as
possible to join it.
Senator Young. And in the event there are any uninitiated
folks who are following these proceedings, if we could get the
PRC to join this declaration, then that would embed what we
believe are the appropriate standards into AI technologies that
they develop, and presumably would like to sell into the
markets of the United States, many of our allies and partners,
and other signatories.
So, embedding those values, you know, like privacy,
openness, transparency, consumer protection into systems is a
quite powerful thing for us to do, geopolitically speaking. You
indicate the challenge, however, moving forward is to get more
to sign on, including the PRC. It is been signed by over 50
countries, which is notable and important.
But notably absent are our strategic competitors and
potential adversaries, certainly China, among those. Do you
believe this puts us and our allies at any sort of disadvantage
relative to non-signatories either in the short or long term?
Ms. Jenkins. As we are in the early stages, I just want to
highlight that we continue to have conversations with countries
around the world to join us. At this point, not necessarily a
disadvantage. We think right now many countries are thinking
about how they will integrate AI into the military.
We think it is being responsible leadership that the U.S.
has on this and continues to need to have in these issues of
international security that we should be leading this work, and
trying to bring as many countries as possible onto this from
around the world to make sure it is seen as something that all
countries in different regions want to join.
So, we feel that that is the real focus for us right now,
is to get more countries on, as many as possible.
Senator Young. Well, it sounds like you do not see a
substantial disadvantage to our country compared to those who
choose not to sign on, because it could give them more
flexibility. Maybe you see it the way I do, which is overall
this effort brings great advantage to our country because it
aligns other countries with our own value system, and that
makes us stronger even though there is obviously more
flexibility for countries like the CCP who do not sign on to
develop standards in any way they like.
Ms. Jenkins. Particularly in these new areas of emerging
technology, it is important to bring as many countries as
possible on these responsible behavior norms. It is really, we
think, in everyone's national security to be a part of these
things,
Senator Young. OK. Well, I will look forward to this
continued dialogue. Perhaps not enough time for me to dive into
Israel security assistance. So, I will submit a question for
the record that you can respond to. Thank you.
[Editor's note.--The question and answer were not received
at print time.]
The Chairman. Senator Kaine.
Senator Kaine. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you,
Secretary Jenkins.
I think Senator Shaheen may have raised AUKUS, but I really
want to focus on that. I am the Chairman of the Seapower
Subcommittee on Armed Services and the Americas Subcommittee
here. But because of the kind of overlapping defense diplomacy
aspect of AUKUS framework, I have been very involved in it.
And I want to ask you about a recent action. On May 1, the
State Department published a set of proposed rules creating
ITAR exemptions for the defense trade and cooperation necessary
to fulfill the AUKUS partnership. Talk us through kind of the
high points of this State Department proposal and how you
believe they will foster a closer alignment of the industrial
bases of the three nations.
Ms. Jenkins. Thank you, Senator. There is so much to say on
that. I am not sure where to start. So as a result of AUKUS,
one of the things that is going to be very important for us to
do because of the interoperability nature of what we are trying
to do with Australia, and the UK, with the U.S., is to be able
in what we call Pillar 2, which is what we are focusing on and
extended on our emerging technology side of AUKUS, is to be
able to work very closely with our two partners and to be able
to have more license free exchange of data, equipment,
technology, and intellectual property.
So the way that we needed to do this was, and I thank
everyone here for passing the NDAA, but also working very
closely with the UK and Australia in the type of legislation
that they also had to pass within their governments so that we
can have the type of exchange and open license to equipment
that we need.
And as a result of the work that all three countries have
put in, in the past few months, in a much more accelerated rate
than normal; it normally takes, you know, 6 to 12 months to do
something like this, if not longer, because we are talking
about new legislation, we have been able to get to the point
that we have these exemptions from ITAR that we want to come
into force.
But before we could do that, we needed to have an
opportunity for industry to weigh in because that is very
important since they are going to be implementing it. So, May
1, as you said, we put that in the Federal Register. Right now,
industry is commenting on that. The U.S., the UK, and Australia
have a team that is going to speak with industry in all three
countries to answer any questions that they may have about it.
And because it is going to open up so much more license
free capability amongst the three countries, it is going to be
a very important part of our working together on all the
emerging technology aspects of AUKUS.
Senator Kaine. And this sounds like kind of a geeky
discussion maybe to people watching, but I think America's
greatest strength is our alliances. And I think it is the one
thing that we have that our adversaries generally have not
invested time in. They are starting to realize they are at a
deficit. And so, Russia, Iran, China, North Korea are trying to
draw closer together because they see that the alliances that
the U.S. and other democratic nations have is a powerful force
multiplier.
And so, ITAR, where you are throwing that around, but
again, just for folks watching who may not know what it is,
ITAR is a set of rules that is trying to protect U.S.
intellectual property, especially in important defense areas.
So that by sharing it too casually, we do not give away
strategic advantages that we have, and yet if we are going to
be interoperable with our allies, there needs to be some
sharing.
And so, part of the challenge, but it was a challenge I
think we at least met in the first steps in the AUKUS
legislation, was figuring out ways to build this framework,
Australia, UK, U.S., where we can begin to share, gaining
exemptions from some of the ITAR prohibitions that in the past
might have stopped us. And I think that is very important.
And I am assuming that in coming up with these rules with
respect to AUKUS, the State Department is also thinking down
the road. Well, like in Pillar 2, we have other nations like
Japan that have expressed interest in being part of Pillar 2. I
was with the Canadian Defense Minister yesterday, what a great
partner Canada is, especially in the Arctic and in North
America, but they are Pacific nation as well.
And so, these template changes to open up exemptions from
ITAR are not just about AUKUS, but I am assuming that the State
Department is doing them thinking down the road for the
possibilities of other democratic allies working with us on
important defense priorities. Am I right in making that
assumption?
Ms. Jenkins. Yes. Actually, in April, all three countries,
we are working very closely together, all three countries on
all of the discussions about new partners have come up with
some modalities, some ways forward, some considerations for new
partners in Pillar 2.
And so, we are starting to consider consultations. And as
you know Japan has been--it is one of the countries we are
going to have consultations with in terms of bringing them in.
We have not yet gotten to a decision yet about the how, how we
are going to work through that part in terms of ITAR. But
certainly, as we do these consultations, and work with
countries, and consider finances, what kind of technology they
have, you know, in terms of what kind of protections they have
already, these will be the things that we are going to be
considering and taking very seriously.
Senator Kaine. Good. And I will just say and conclude, you
know, it is important to get the AUKUS piece right before we
like prematurely add others in. And yet, at the same time, I do
think it is a good template for how we can become more
interoperable with our allies.
And if we craft the rules about AUKUS in such a way that we
are mindful of the opportunities that others may want to join,
then AUKUS will not only be good, in and of itself, but I think
it will help us innovate down the road to keep the world safer.
So, thank you for that.
Ms. Jenkins. Thank you.
Senator Kaine. I yield back.
The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Kaine.
Senator Risch.
Senator Risch. First of all, I want to follow up on Senator
Kaine's remarks. Let me say that up here, there are a number of
us that think--I will be very frank about it. You are being too
tough on ITAR. ITAR is really, really important when you are
trying to withhold secrets from Russia, and China, and others.
But AUKUS is an outstanding enterprise. It is the NATO of
the 21st century right now for the Indo-Pacific. And it is
really important not only that we get this right, but that we
craft it as rapidly as we can, and craft it right.
ITAR was put in place for a very good reason. But you know
as well as I do that both of our allies, strong allies, Great
Britain, and Australia, are complaining about the fact that we
are being too tough on the ITAR rules. They are partners, they
are friends. If we are going to work together with them, they
need to have access and flex.
I think Senator Kaine is right about expanding. If you want
to talk about expanding, that is all well and good, but we have
got to get this thing up and running before we talk about
expanding. And we also, as was pointed out, need to look
forward to what we do with ITAR as we expand. But just because
we flex or waive ITAR in certain circumstances with the two
current allies does not mean we have to carry that forward with
when we admit somebody else.
So, I would urge you with all speed and haste to get
through these ITAR issues, which seem to me to be stumbling
blocks which do not need to be there.
So, thank you.
Thank you, Senator Kaine, for your remarks on that.
The Chairman. And Senator Risch, I agree with you. We have
to get through the ITAR challenges. I must tell you there are
two sides to that, and I have talked to both the Brits and the
Australians about it, and they are making progress on their
side as well. I think we have got to have a meeting of the
minds as quickly as possible on this, which requires some
legislative change. And I think our allies understand that.
And I hope that can be resolved quickly for the reasons
that Senator Kaine and Senator Risch said. It is important that
we move forward with the ability to advance the technologies in
this area, and that requires a stronger information sharing and
technology sharing among the three countries.
The record of the committee will remain open until close of
business tomorrow for questions that may be asked by members of
the committee. Some have already indicated they plan to take
advantage of that. We ask you to please respond to those
questions as soon as possible.
And there be no further business, the hearing will be
adjourned. Thank you.
[Whereupon, at 11:19 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.

Additional Material Submitted for the Record
Responses of Ms. Bonnie D. Jenkins to Questions
Submitted by Senator Robert Menendez
Question. In the wake of Russia's suspension of New START, how will
the United States re-engage with Russia to bring them back into high-
impact level talks, without showing dependency on U.S. allies and
partner conventional forces; a vulnerability identified in U.S.
strategy by both nuclear-armed adversaries, Russia and the People's
Republic of China (PRC)?
Answer. The United States remains open to constructive dialogue and
continues to press Russia to fully implement its obligations under the
New START Treaty and to engage with us on a post-February 2026 nuclear
arms control arrangement. We will continue our close coordination with
allies and partners to ensure Russia gains no advantage from its
irresponsible actions.
Question. How will you change, if necessary and appropriate, U.S.
deterrence strategy, practice, and force structure to decisively
influence the unique decision calculus of Russia?
Answer. The 2022 Nuclear Posture Review recognizes that as the
security environment evolves, changes in U.S. strategy and posture may
be required to sustain the ability to achieve deterrence, assurance,
and employment objectives for both Russia and the PRC. The United
States continuously assesses the sufficiency of our strategic posture
to ensure we can fulfill the roles of nuclear weapons to deter
strategic attacks, assure U.S. allies and partners, and achieve
Presidential objectives if deterrence fails. The United States will do
what is necessary to protect the security of this Nation, as well as
our allies and partners.
Question. How do you view and envision the next 2 years of
engagement with Russia before the expiration of New Start?
Answer. The United States remains open to constructive dialogue and
continues to press Russia to fully implement its obligations under the
New START Treaty and to engage with us on a post-February 2026 nuclear
arms control arrangement. We will continue our close coordination with
allies and partners to ensure Russia gains no advantage from its
irresponsible actions. The United States also will continue to adhere
to the New START central limits while the treaty remains in force so
long as Russia does.
Question. How will you  work with the Congress
to increase information transparency and improve knowledge-sharing
regarding U.S. engagement with Russia and other countries, such as the
PRC and Saudi Arabia, on nuclear enrichment and arms control, among
other relevant issue areas?
Answer. We are committed to keeping Congress fully informed of our
diplomatic efforts on arms control and nonproliferation issues. With
respect to arms control engagement with Russia and the PRC, in addition
to myself, the Assistant Secretary for Arms Control, Deterrence, and
Stability is available for briefings and updates at your convenience.
The United States remains committed to limiting the spread of uranium
enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing globally. My team in the Bureau
of International Security and Nonproliferation provides regular updates
to the relevant congressional committees regarding negotiations for
bilateral civil nuclear cooperation agreements with a number of
countries. We are committed to continued, regular engagement with our
congressional partners on these important issues.
Question. Do you have plans to work with the Congress to modernize
the U.S. nuclear security enterprise infrastructure and organization as
well as our space architecture?
Answer. Responsibilities for the U.S. nuclear production
enterprise, U.S. nuclear deterrence capabilities, and U.S. NC3
architecture are largely the province of the Department of Defense and
the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration. I
defer to them regarding the specifics of those responsibilities. We
will continue to support these efforts and will continue to update
Congress on related matters relevant to the Department of State's
delineated responsibilities.
Question. Given the diverse views among the agencies, such as that
of DIA and the Department of Defense (DOD), on China's nuclear use
policy, how do you view the PRC's policy of nuclear force as well as
its concept of nuclear deterrence, based on your engagements with China
at the secretarial level?
Answer. I concur with DoD's assessment in the 2023 China Military
Power Report that, despite the PRC's declared No First Use nuclear
policy, PRC strategy probably includes consideration of a nuclear
strike in response to certain nonnuclear attacks, as well as if a
conventional military defeat in Taiwan threatened CCP regime survival.
In my engagements with the PRC, the PRC has yet to acknowledge its
rapid and opaque nuclear weapons build up, nor has it contended with
the fact that this activity appears to depart from its longstanding
approach to nuclear deterrence.
Question. According to recent intelligence reports, how do you view
the PRC's push for talks between the United States and Russia, in
context of the larger Chinese nuclear threat? What does this concern
mean for U.S. nuclear strategy?
Answer. The United States accepts its responsibility as a nuclear
weapons state to engage in good faith in nuclear risk reduction and
arms control. As we have said many times, we remain ready to engage
with both Russia and the PRC on these critical matters. We welcome
calls from the PRC for Russia to exhibit that same readiness;
unfortunately, Russia has refused to engage on nuclear risk reduction
and strategic arms control to this point. At the same time, we also
continue to press the PRC to also substantively engage on these issues,
including on risk reduction. As we stated in the 2022 NPR, we will need
to account for the PRC's nuclear weapons expansion in any future U.S.-
Russia arms control arrangements.
Question. Do you plan on renewing dialogues with China soon and in
a consistent manner, given their lack of communication and or interest
in collaboration with the United States on nuclear arms control since
the 2023 U.S.-China Summit?
Answer. The United States will continue to maintain open channels
of communication with the PRC and responsibly manage competition in the
relationship to prevent miscalculation and unintended conflict.
However, the PRC has declined a follow-on arms control and
nonproliferation consultation and has not provided a substantive
response to the potential risk reduction measures we put forward. Given
the importance of reducing strategic risks, the United States will
continue to press the PRC on the need for substantive engagement on
these issues and to increase transparency regarding its rapidly
expanding nuclear arsenal. At the same time the United States will
continue taking prudent steps to ensure our own security and that of
our allies and partners.
Question. In your view, how do you judge the role of AI
technologies, particularly nuclear weapons systems with AI-based
targeting, in nuclear diplomacy?
Answer. Nowhere is it more crucial to set strong and transparent
norms than in the potential application of AI and other emerging
technologies to nuclear operations. AI, in and of itself, isn't
necessarily destabilizing, it is just an enabling technology. While AI
could be applied to enhance the security of nuclear weapons, and to
improve the resilience of command, control, and communications, we are
also acutely aware of the risks of using AI in relation to nuclear
weapons, including potential cybersecurity concerns and
vulnerabilities. And the possible use of AI by irresponsible states to
inform or support their nuclear operations raises serious concerns
about how AI systems might affect nuclear risks.
Norms development can make positive contributions to enhancing
predictability and stability. For these reasons the United States has
made, together with the United Kingdom and France, the commitment to
``maintain human control and involvement for all actions critical to
informing and executing sovereign decisions concerning nuclear weapons
employment.'' We continue to encourage the Russian Federation and the
PRC to join us in this commitment.
Question. Can AI technologies have the potential to become
bargaining chips in multilateral arms talks between the United States,
Russia, and China?
Answer. AI offers significant opportunities to enhance U.S.
security through the transformation it can bring to our military and
intelligence collection capabilities. The use of AI in military
applications is governed by existing law, in particular international
humanitarian law. Further, we see an opportunity to build international
support around U.S.-led norms of responsible behavior for the military
use of AI. A significant step in creating that normative framework is
the Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and Autonomy. In the 14 months since the U.S.
unveiled the Political Declaration, 55 countries have endorsed this
global initiative that emphasizes the responsible use of AI. The
Declaration includes ten responsible practices for the development and
deployment of AI in the military domain including advocating for
rigorous testing, auditable systems, and senior-level oversight of
high-impact applications. This groundbreaking initiative seeks to
promote transparency, accountability, and responsible behavior among
states developing and deploying military AI technologies.
Question. How and where can the United States, whether at the
congressional and or executive level, improve our understanding of AI
systems given the current nascent phase of AI research and development
in nuclear arms?
Answer. The Department would welcome the opportunity to provide
briefings to Members and Staff about our work related to artificial
intelligence, including the Political Declaration.
Through our work on the Political Declaration on Responsible
Military Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomy we seek to
take steps to implement the Declaration's ten responsible practices. At
the inaugural plenary in March, we brought together 160 participants
from 60 states, including observers from 14 non-endorsing states. The
event was a major step toward implementing the Political Declaration
and the endorsing states formed three working groups focused on
accountability, oversight, and assurance. Through workshops, expert
level exchanges, and the production of deliverables such as reports,
endorsing states will strive to attain a better understanding of how to
implement legal and oversight policies and best practices for military
use of AI; best practices on issues like training and staffing to
enable and promote responsibility and accountability; and policies and
practices to reduce risks and establish justified confidence in the
reliability of military AI capabilities.

Responses of Ms. Bonnie D. Jenkins to Questions
Submitted by Senator James E. Risch
Question. How is the administration planning for what will happen
post New START Treaty?
Answer. Looking toward 2026, we remain clear-eyed about the
challenges of engaging with Russia on nuclear arms control and risk
reduction. The United States stands ready to hold discussions without
preconditions, which does not mean without accountability, with Russia
on both its return to full compliance with the New START Treaty and a
post-February 2026 nuclear arms control framework. The United States
must also prepare for the possibility that Russia does not engage
constructively and there is no post-February 2026 nuclear arms control
framework. In either scenario, the United States will assess the
sufficiency of our strategic posture to ensure we can fulfill the key
roles identified in the 2022 Nuclear Posture Review in a dynamic
security environment: deter strategic attacks, assure U.S. allies and
partners, and achieve Presidential objectives if deterrence fails.
Question. The Biden Administration continues to advocate for the
entry into force of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) even
though China is not a signatory and Russia has revoked its
ratification. Why is the administration still pushing the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty?
Answer. Since 1992, the United States has had a self-imposed
moratorium on nuclear explosive testing. Once in force, a global,
legally binding ban on nuclear explosive testing in all environments
would be in the national security interest of the United States. Entry
into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) would
enhance our efforts to prevent the further proliferation of nuclear
weapons.
Question. Is Russia testing nuclear weapons now that it has revoked
its ratification to the CTBT?
Answer. There has been thus far no indication that Russia's
withdrawal of its ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban
Treaty (CTBT) in November 2023 is paired with a change in its nuclear
testing-related actions.
Question. Is China conducting nuclear tests?
Answer. Given the lack of transparency with regard to its nuclear
arsenal build up and nuclear testing activities and previously
identified adherence issues, the United States remains concerned about
the PRC's adherence to its moratoria. The United States continues to
emphasize the need for the PRC to increase its nuclear weapons-related
transparency, including during a bilateral consultation with the PRC in
November 2023. We would be happy to brief you on the specific concerns
in the appropriate forum.
Question. What is the administration's strategy for taking
advantage of our withdrawal from the INF treaty?
Answer. The Department of Defense (DoD) continues to develop and
deploy conventional capabilities that would previously have been
prohibited under the INF Treaty.
Question. Per your exchange with Congressman Connolly during the
House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing earlier this year, do you
believe that we are less safe now that we have withdrawn from the INF
Treaty?
Answer. As I referenced to Congressman Connolly, the world is more
secure with valid arms control treaties. For many years, the INF Treaty
had eliminated the threat posed by Russian intermediate-range missiles.
But Russia's material breach of the INF Treaty and refusal to return to
compliance despite 6 years of high-level U.S. and Allied engagement
made the United States, its allies and partners, and the world less
safe. Russia bears sole responsibility for the demise of the INF
Treaty.
Question. The New START Treaty will expire in 2026 and cannot be
renewed. Does the Biden Administration believe that our current nuclear
posture will be sufficient for a world without arms control?
Answer. The United States continuously assesses the sufficiency of
our strategic posture to ensure we can fulfill the key roles identified
in the 2022 Nuclear Posture Review in a dynamic security environment:
deter strategic attacks, assure U.S. allies and partners, and achieve
Presidential objectives if deterrence fails. If potential adversaries
are unbound by arms control, that will certainly factor into our
assessments of what is sufficient. We remain confident in our current
nuclear forces and posture today, but if nuclear force adjustments are
required to maintain deterrence, we must be prepared to execute them in
sufficient time to avoid a deterrence shortfall.
Question. Does the U.S. need to field a Sea-Launched Nuclear Cruise
Missile to strengthen deterrence, extended deterrence or allied
assurance? If no, why?
Answer. The Fiscal Year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA) directed the establishment of a SLCM-N program. DoD is complying
with the law and looking to execute the NDAA requirement in a manner
that provides the most deterrence value for the least risk to the
modernization program, the production enterprise, and the Joint Force.
I defer to DoD on the status of that effort and the envisioned role for
the SLCM-N in our assurance and deterrence strategies going forward.
Question. Does the U.S. need to upload additional warheads to its
ICBM force in response to China's nuclear breakout?
Answer. The United States remains confident in its current nuclear
forces and posture today. The United States continuously assesses the
sufficiency of our strategic posture to ensure we can fulfill the key
roles identified in the 2022 Nuclear Posture Review in a dynamic
security environment: deter strategic attacks, assure U.S. allies and
partners, and achieve Presidential objectives if deterrence fails.
Potential adjustments will be assessed through careful consideration of
the implications for strategic stability; the capacity of the defense
industrial base and the nuclear weapons production enterprise; cost;
competing priorities; the need to deliver modernized nuclear forces;
and potential adversary countervailing responses. As National Security
Advisor Jake Sullivan said, effective deterrence means that we have a
``better'' approach--not a ``more'' approach.
Question. China has undertaken a nuclear breakout, Russia has
suspended New START and the treaty expires in 2026. Why does a nuclear
modernization program that is based on maintaining strategic parity
with Russia under the New START treaty still make sense?
Answer. The United States continuously assesses the sufficiency of
our strategic posture to ensure we can fulfill the key roles identified
in the 2022 Nuclear Posture Review in a dynamic security environment:
deter strategic attacks, assure U.S. allies and partners, and achieve
Presidential objectives if deterrence fails. As National Security
Advisor Jake Sullivan said in June 2023, the United States will
``ensure that we have the capacity and capabilities necessary to deter
and, if necessary, defeat major aggression against our country, our
allies, and our partners.''
Question. Do you believe that conventional weapons can substitute
for nuclear weapons in terms of deterrence and employment?
Answer. Nuclear weapons continue to provide unique deterrence
effects that no other element of U.S. military power can replace.
As part of the 2022 Nuclear Posture Review, the Department of
Defense (DoD) committed to seek to identify and assess the ability of
non-nuclear capabilities to contribute to deterrence, and will
integrate these capabilities into operational plans, as appropriate. I
defer to DoD on the status of those efforts.
Question. Are we going to adapt our theater posture to account for
China's rapid nuclear modernization efforts?
Answer. As the security environment evolves, it may be necessary to
consider strategy and force posture adjustments to ensure our ability
to achieve deterrence and other objectives with respect to the People's
Republic of China. The PRC's build up features heavily as a topic in
our deterrence dialogues with Indo-Pacific allies. We remain confident
in our current nuclear forces and posture today, but if nuclear force
adjustments are required to maintain deterrence, we must be prepared to
execute them in sufficient time to avoid a deterrence shortfall.
Question. What steps is the Administration taking to strengthen
deterrence and extended deterrence in the Indo-Pacific?
Answer. We continuously evaluate the security environment in the
region to ensure that our nuclear strategy and force posture meet our
requirements. We are enhancing and deepening our alliances with the
Republic of Korea, Japan, and Australia to ensure an effective mix of
capabilities, concepts, deployments, exercises and tailored options to
deter and, if necessary, respond to coercion and aggression. We are
also working with each ally to improve crisis management consultation
and identify opportunities to increase the visibility of U.S. strategic
assets in the region.
Question. Is China in compliance with its Article VI obligations
under the NPT?
Answer. The PRC's rapid nuclear weapons build up and lack of
transparency is alarming and risks undermining decades of international
progress toward nuclear disarmament. Although the available evidence
does not support a conclusion that the PRC is in violation of its NPT
Article VI obligations, we will continue to closely monitor its nuclear
activities.
Question. Does the U.S. accept mutual vulnerability with China?
Answer. Based on conclusions set out in the 2022 Nuclear Posture
Review and Missile Defense Review, the United States will continue to
rely on strategic deterrence to deter large intercontinental-range
nuclear missile threats to the homeland. We remain focused on how the
PRC is increasing its capability to threaten the United States, our
allies, and our partners, including through its nuclear weapons
capabilities. For the first time in our history, by the 2030's the
United States will face two major nuclear powers as strategic
competitors and potential adversaries. We are determined to maintain
and, where necessary, strengthen a tailored deterrence strategy and
flexible nuclear capabilities to convey clearly to the PRC and other
nuclear armed competitors that they can never achieve strategic
advantage through nuclear employment, and that the United States will
not be coerced into abandoning our allies and partners.
Question. What are the implications of novel and advanced nuclear
weapons, to include, reports that Russia has deployed nuclear weapons
in outer space?
Answer. Russia's new types and new kinds of advanced nuclear weapon
delivery systems, such as Poseidon, have direct effects on strategic
stability and must be addressed in any future arms control arrangement.
Russia's pursuit of a nuclear-armed anti-satellite capability would
threaten the vital communications, scientific, meteorological,
agricultural, commercial, and national security services that any and
all satellites provide to societies around the globe. It is also
irresponsible and, if deployed, would violate the Outer Space Treaty
that has been in place nearly six decades. Following Russia's veto of
that resolution, we will continue to urge the international community
to take steps to address this challenge.
Question. What is the role of nuclear weapons in the defense of
NATO?
Answer. As the 2022 NATO Strategic Concept states, NATO's
deterrence and defense posture is based on an appropriate mix of
nuclear, conventional, and missile defense capabilities. Complemented
by space and cyber capabilities. The fundamental purpose of NATO's
nuclear capability is to preserve peace, prevent coercion, and deter
aggression.
The strategic nuclear forces of the Alliance, particularly those of
the United States, are the supreme guarantee of the security of the
Alliance.
Question. Would a Russian deployment of nuclear weapons in Belarus
constitute a violation of its NPT commitments?
Answer. The transfer by Russia or receipt of Belarus of a nuclear
weapon or control over a nuclear weapon, for example, could raise
compliance concerns with respect to NPT Articles I and II. As a policy
issue we have emphasized repeatedly that Russia's announcements are
part of a broader body of dangerous and irresponsible nuclear rhetoric.
Question. Is Russia in compliance with its NPT Article VI
commitments?
Answer. Russia's irresponsible and reckless nuclear saber-rattling
highlights the importance of reducing nuclear and strategic risks and
avoiding nuclear war. Although the available evidence does not support
a conclusion that Russia is in violation of its NPT Article VI
obligations, we will continue to closely monitor its nuclear
activities.
Question. On May 1, the State Department determined that Russia has
used the chemical weapon chloropicrin against Ukrainian forces in
violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). What is the
administration's strategy for addressing Russia's continuous non-
compliance in this space?
Answer. The United States continues to work with allies and
partners in several multilateral fora, including the Organization for
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), to hold Russia accountable
for its non-compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). At
the OPCW, the United States led an effort that added Novichok nerve
agents to the CWC's Annex on Chemicals, lobbied multilateral support
that denied the Russians a seat on the OPCW's Executive Council, and
helped establish a Trust Fund to support OPCW assistance to Ukraine.
The United States is also working closely with the Ukrainian government
as it seeks assistance from the OPCW to investigate Russian use of riot
control agents and chloropicrin against Ukraine's armed forces. In May
2024, the United States determined that Russia has used the chemical
weapon chloropicrin in Ukraine and imposed sanctions on Russia under
the Chemical and Biological Weapons Act and took additional measures
against Russia's chemical and biological weapons programs in
coordination with the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
Question. The DPRK is significantly increasing the size and quality
of its nuclear weapons. What are the implications of the improvements
that North Korea is making in diversification and sophistication of its
delivery systems?
Answer. The DPRK's weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic
missile programs constitute serious threats to international peace and
security and the global nonproliferation regime, and are in direct
violation of multiple U.N. Security Council Resolutions. The DPRK's
continued diversification of its delivery systems and advancement of
its nuclear capabilities are increasing the threat that the DPRK poses
to U.S., allied, and global security and stability. The U.S. extended
deterrence commitments to the Republic of Korea and Japan are ironclad,
and the United States will continue to strengthen our alliances in the
face of increasing regional threats, including from the DPRK.
Question. Does the U.S. need to return nuclear weapons to the
Korean Peninsula to deter the DPRK? To assure the ROK and Japan? If no,
why?
Answer. It is U.S. policy to neither confirm nor deny the presence
or absence of nuclear weapons at any general or specific location.
While we retain the capability to forward deploy nuclear forces
worldwide, the United States has no plans to change our regional
deterrence posture at this time. That said, the Administration is
committed to modernizing our central deterrence triad forces while
strengthening extended deterrence, including enhancing the visibility
of strategic assets in the region, to respond to growing threats,
continue to deter the DPRK, and reassure our ROK Ally. We also support
an integrated deterrence approach that leverages non-nuclear
capabilities. Our goal remains the denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula.
Question. What are the implications of the missile cooperation
between North Korea and Russia?
Answer. This expanding relationship between the DPRK and Russia,
including arms and missile transfers in direct violation of multiple
United Nations Security Council resolutions, undermines regional
stability and threatens the global nonproliferation regime, peace and
stability on the Korean Peninsula, and freedom and independence of the
Ukrainian people. The United States will continue to strengthen our
alliances and extended deterrence in the face of increasing regional
threats.
Question. Will the Administration agree to discuss enhanced nuclear
planning and the establishment of new crisis consultations mechanism
with Japan and South Korea?
Answer. The Administration discusses joint U.S.-ROK nuclear and
strategic planning through the U.S.-ROK Nuclear Consultative Group. The
Administration regularly engages with Japan on sustaining and
strengthening extended deterrence through the Extended Deterrence
Dialogue (EDD). An important U.S. goal is to identify opportunities for
trilateral (United States, Japan, ROK) or quadrilateral (plus
Australia) information sharing and dialogue.
Question. Can you explain why the administration won't return
nuclear weapons to Asia?
Answer. It is U.S. policy to neither confirm nor deny the presence
or absence of nuclear weapons at any general or specific location.
While we retain the capability to forward deploy nuclear forces
worldwide, the United States has no plans to change our regional
deterrence posture at this time. As the security environment evolves,
it may be necessary to consider nuclear strategy and force posture
adjustments to sustain effective deterrence of potential adversaries
and assurance of allies and partners. Any decision to adapt our theater
defense posture would be made only after interagency deliberation and
consultation with allies and Congress.
Question. What is the U.S.-ROK Nuclear Consultative Group? What
does it do and what are its novel and strategic benefits?
Answer. The NCG is a bilateral consultative body tailored to
facilitate joint U.S.-ROK nuclear and strategic planning with a focus
on ensuring the continued safety and security of the people of the ROK,
including the significant number of Americans who reside in that
country, as well as the U.S. servicemembers forward deployed to the
Korean Peninsula.
The NCG has improved the frequency and depth of communication
between the United States and the ROK on issues related to nuclear
deterrence; increased the frequency of tabletop exercises and
simulations that enhance understanding of threats on the Peninsula and
stimulate shared preparedness to strengthen deterrence; created
additional opportunities for site visits that showcase U.S. and ROK
deterrence capabilities; established a nuclear deterrence immersion
course for ROK officials; and enhanced information-sharing, including
through joint threat assessments.
Question. The war in Ukraine and Russia's nuclear sabre rattling
has created a renewed focus on NATO's nuclear mission. Is there
interest from new NATO allies in supporting NATO nuclear operations?
Answer. Allies remain committed to the imperative to ensure the
broadest possible participation by Allies concerned in NATO's nuclear
burden-sharing arrangements to demonstrate Alliance unity and resolve.
Allies understand the importance of nuclear deterrence and across
the Alliance, Allies have expressed increased interest in participating
in various ways including hosting nuclear-related NATO meetings in the
Capitals, participating in nuclear military exercises, contributing and
procuring conventional support for nuclear operations, sharing
intelligence, among other means of participation.
Question. Will the Biden Administration undertake enhanced forms of
planning for nuclear weapons related contingencies with Japan?
Answer. Yes. Since publication of the 2022 Nuclear Posture Review,
using the U.S.-Japan Extended Deterrence Dialogue venue, the United
States has prioritized strengthening extended deterrence consultations,
emphasizing a cooperative approach between the United States and Japan,
in planning and decisionmaking related to nuclear deterrence policy.
Question. Will the Biden Administration undertake enhanced forms of
planning for nuclear weapons related contingencies with South Korea?
Answer. Yes. Through the Nuclear Consultative Group, the United
States is seeking to strengthen extended deterrence, discuss nuclear
and strategic planning, and manage the threat to the nonproliferation
regime posed by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
Question. Will the Biden Administration agree to create new nuclear
crisis consultation mechanisms with Japan?
Answer. As explained in the 2022 NPR, we are identifying pragmatic
steps to enhance consultations, including examining options to improve
crisis management consultations, with Indo-Pacific allies. Any efforts
undertaken will be tailored to each alliance. With Japan, the Extended
Deterrence Dialogue (EDD), which has existed since 2010, already
provides a robust venue for discussion of these efforts, including ways
to coordinate Alliance deterrence efforts and crisis management.
Question. Will the Biden Administration agree to create new nuclear
crisis consultation mechanisms with South Korea?
Answer. In 2023, President Biden and President Yoon Suk Yeol of the
ROK announced, through the Washington Declaration, the establishment of
the Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG) to strengthen extended deterrence,
discuss nuclear and strategic planning, and manage the threat to the
nonproliferation regime posed by the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea.
Question. Does the Biden Administration believe it needs more
theater based nuclear capability in Asia in order to strengthen
extended deterrence?
Answer. As the security environment evolves, it may be necessary to
consider nuclear strategy and force posture adjustments to sustain
effective deterrence of potential adversaries and assurance of allies
and partners.
Question. Does the Biden Administration believe it needs more
theater based nuclear capability in Asia in order to strengthen allied
assurance?
Answer. We remain confident in our current nuclear forces and
posture today, but if nuclear force adjustments are required to
maintain deterrence, we must be prepared to execute them in sufficient
time to avoid a deterrence shortfall. The United States will assess
potential adjustments through careful consideration of relevant
factors. Additionally, we are enhancing and deepening our alliances
with the Republic of Korea, Japan, and Australia to ensure an effective
mix of capabilities, concepts, deployments, exercises and tailored
options to deter and, if necessary, respond to coercion and aggression.
We are also working with each ally to improve crisis management
consultation and identify opportunities to increase the visibility of
U.S. strategic assets in the region.
Question. How will the administration expedite cooperation on
hypersonic missiles and unmanned systems--both explicitly identified as
key focus areas for Pillar Two?
Answer. AUKUS partners are committed to accelerating the
development of hypersonic and related technologies. To facilitate that
effort, the United States is prioritizing review and adjudication of
Australia and UK requests, including defense export licenses, for
advanced missile technology. We are committed to seamless cooperation
with both partners and focused on driving further innovation and
cooperation in this critical area while maintaining our shared
international nonproliferation commitments.
Question. According to Sec. 1342 of the fiscal year NDAA, the
administration is required to provide our committee a report detailing
a list of advanced military platforms. The report was expected 90 days
after enactment of the NDAA, but has yet to be delivered to the
committee. Why is this report delayed and when can we expect the
report?
Answer. The Administration is compiling the report per the
requirements set forth in Section 1342. We intend to provide this
report to the Committee soon.
Question. Also under Pillar Two legislation, as required by the
NDAA, the Secretary of State jointly with the Secretary of Defense is
required to review and update interagency policies and implementation
guidance as they relate to the Foreign Military Sales and Direct
Commercial Sales to include those anticipatory and pre-clearance
releases as mentioned in the previous question. What is the status of
this review and when can the committee expect a briefing on this?
Answer. The Administration is compiling the report. We intend to
provide this information to the Committee soon.
Question. Last week, your administration announced it was pausing
delivery of some weapons to Israel. It is unclear how these munitions
were funded or where they actually are. Who initiated this policy
review of Israel arms transfers, and on what date?
Answer. We consult with the interagency on all proposed transfers.
In April, as Israeli leaders were reaching a decision point on a major
operation in Rafah, the interagency focused on particular weapons that
might be used in Rafah. The Administration continues to engage the
Government of Israel on this issue through the U.S.-Israel Strategic
Consultative Group.
Question. What agencies, bureaus, offices, and officials are
responsible for this review? What is the process, timeline, and
criteria of the review?
Answer. Multiple agencies are involved in the review of arms
transfers to Israel. The Administration paused one shipment of weapons.
We are especially focused on the end-use of the 2,000-pound bombs and
the impact they could have in dense urban settings as we have seen in
other parts of Gaza. We believe that the use of 2,000 pound bombs would
be counterproductive to defeating Hamas, which is a goal we share with
Israel. We have conveyed these concerns to the Israeli government. We
have not made a final decision on proceeding with this shipment.
Question. Exactly what weapons are being delayed?
Answer. We paused one shipment of munitions to Israel. It consists
of 1,818 2,000-pound bombs and 1,704 500-pound bombs.
Question. Were these weapons purchased before or after October 7,
2023?
Answer. The sales were approved this fiscal year consistent with
notifications to Congress ranging from 2004 to 2020.
Question. Were these weapons financed via Foreign Military
Financing, FMS, DCS, or a blended case?
Answer. The cases are FMF-funded, and the transfers are being
executed through the FMS system.
Question. Were supplemental funds or previously appropriated funds
used to purchase the paused weapons deliveries?
Answer. The cases are FMF funded. Given Israel's use of Cash Flow
Financing, it is not possible to definitively confirm the fiscal year
of the funds at this time.
Question. If previously appropriated funds were used to finance
this sale, then what fiscal year were they drawn from?
Answer. The cases are FMF funded. Given Israel's use of Cash Flow
Financing, it is not possible to definitively confirm the fiscal year
of the funds at this time.
Question. Was cash-flow financing used to procure these weapons?
Answer. Cash flow financing impacts the payment schedule for
invoices but is not a tool for payment of invoices. FMF funds support
the procurement of these munitions.
Question. What are the statutory means by which you are pausing
weapons made with already appropriated funding?
Answer. All our activities for FMS cases, including in this matter,
are consistent with the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). The AECA
provides broad authorities that allow us to react to situations where
we have foreign policy concerns.
Question. Are these weapons already in Israel?
Answer. No, the weapons are currently in the United States.
Question. If so, are these weapons in the WRSA-I stockpile?
Answer. The weapons are not in the WRSA-I stockpile.
Question. If the weapons are not already in Israel, where are they?
Answer. The paused shipment is in the United States under DoD
custody.
Question. What is the impact of this decision on related U.S.
defense industry?
Answer. This is one shipment of 3,522 bombs that have already been
produced and paid for. There is no impact on production or the defense
industry in general.
Question. Are the U.S. Government or U.S. contractors accruing
additional costs due to delayed shipments?
Answer. Potential costs due to the delayed shipment are still being
assessed.
Question. What other arms transfers are the administration
reviewing with respect to Israel, and under what conditions would those
arms transfers be held?
Answer. As of now, we have paused one single shipment of weapons
consisting of 1,818 2,000-pound bombs and 1,704 500-pound bombs. All
proposed U.S. arms transfers to any country, including Israel, are
reviewed and adjudicated on a case-by-case basis consistent with the
U.S. Conventional Arms Transfer Policy, which includes assessments of
the diplomatic, security, economic, human rights, and civilian
protection considerations associated with any potential transfer.
Question. Has your administration delayed or revoked the license of
any Israel-related DCS cases? If so, which ones?
Answer. The Department of State carefully reviews all Direct
Commercial Sales (DCS) licenses, for all parties around the world.
Cases must be reviewed rigorously by experts throughout the building to
ensure full compliance with the President's Conventional Arms Transfer
(CAT) Policy. The duration of this review will vary significantly on a
case-by-case basis.
Question. How many Israel-related DCS cases that fall beneath
congressional Notification thresholds are currently under review at the
State Department?
Answer. The number of Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) cases involving
Israel that are pending review with the Directorate of Defense Trade
Controls (DDTC) varies as new licenses are submitted daily. Consistent
with the President's Conventional Arms Transfer policy, all arms
transfer decisions are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The President
has been clear: we will always ensure Israel has what it needs to
defend itself. We are continuing to approve cases related to Israel.
Question. How, when, and at what level did you communicate to
Israel the pause in weapons shipments?
Answer. We are in constant dialogue with Israel on meeting its
security assistance requests as well as our expectations on use of
munitions provided by the United States, including Israel's adherence
to international law.
Question. What are the conditions under which the shipment of these
weapons will be resumed? Have these been communicated with Israel?
Answer. We are in close consultations with the Israelis at the
highest levels via the U.S.-Israel Strategic Consultative Group, which
is led by National Security Advisor Sullivan. This is an ongoing
dialogue where we are discussing military operations in Rafah,
humanitarian assistance, civilian harm mitigation, and security
assistance, among other critical topics. It is a process that we stood
up to have the tough conversations. The process is meant to be
consultative, and it is through this process that we will jointly
develop next steps regarding the paused shipment.
Question. What agencies are involved in the delayed shipment and
under what legal authority are these agencies operating?
Answer. Situations like this require a collaborative approach and
are addressed through regular interagency coordination. All our
activities for FMS cases, including in this matter, are consistent with
the Arms Export Control Act.
Question. With which Members of Congress did your administration
consult with regarding this pause and when?
Answer. The President assessed the circumstances surrounding the
war and decided to pause one shipment of munitions. The action was in
the national security interest of the United States and involved
sensitive diplomatic engagements.
Question. Why wasn't your decision conveyed to Congress the day it
was made, given Congress' longstanding role in security assistance and
arms transfers to Israel, including through the supplemental assistance
package the administration strenuously advocated for 7 months?
Answer. The President assessed the circumstances surrounding the
war and decided to pause one shipment of munitions. The action was in
the national security interest of the United States and involved
sensitive diplomatic engagements.
Question. Have you determined Israel has been involved in an AECA
Section 3(c)(2) violation?
Answer. We have not submitted any reports under section 3 of the
AECA. If a substantial violation is identified, the matter will be
reported to Congress consistent with the requirements of section 3 of
the AECA.
Question. What message does the arms freeze send to our partners
around the world? What conclusions are our adversaries making?
Answer. Since Hamas' horrific attack on October 7, the United
States has surged billions of dollars in security assistance to Israel;
provided essential defense articles to Israel directly from U.S.
stocks; requested the enactment of a significant supplemental
appropriation for emergency assistance for Israel; and led an
unprecedented coalition to defend Israel against direct Iranian
attacks. We will continue to do whatever is necessary to ensure Israel
can defend itself from the threats it faces. This was a single paused
shipment. We continue to send military assistance, approve cases, offer
contracts, and send shipments of military items. The U.S. relationship
with Israel is steadfast.
Question. How were the weapons you are withholding from Israel paid
for? Were they financed in the supplemental or previous appropriations?
Are these weapons already in Israel or are they in the U.S.?
Answer. The cases are FMF funded. Given Israel's access to Cash
Flow Financing, it is not possible to definitively confirm from which
fiscal year the funds are drawn at this time. These weapons remain in
the United States.
Question. Like most arms control, the MTCR has continued to
constrain the West. What is the administration's strategy for
addressing the fact that Chinese drones are being flown by both
Russians and Ukrainians?
Answer. The MTCR is a critical tool to address the proliferation of
missiles used as delivery systems for nuclear weapons, a core national
security interest. U.S. commitments to the MTCR do not prevent us from
providing our most advanced missile technology to close partners.
The PRC remains the world's leading proliferator of equipment and
technology capable of supporting the development of weapons of mass
destruction, their delivery systems, or advanced conventional weapons.
As a transshipment state, the PRC allows Iranian and Russian
procurement networks to operate within its jurisdiction, supplying
electrical components, antennas, engines, and other components, most of
which fall below MTCR control thresholds and those of other
multilateral export control regimes, but are still critical to the
development of UAVs for both Iran and Russia.
State has continued to raise the issue of PRC dual-use exports and
transshipments to Russia at the highest levels. In collaboration with
the Departments of the Treasury and Commerce, State has worked to
identify and sanction or add to the Commerce Department's Entity List,
hundreds of Russian, Iranian, and PRC entities involved in the UAV
trade. State continues to work with partners, transshipment states, and
private industry to counter the proliferation of Chinese components and
drones to Russia.
Question. You recently re-named the Arms Control, Verification and
Compliance Bureau to the Arms Control, Deterrence and Stability Bureau.
How many personnel in the Arms Control Bureau spend the preponderance
of their time working on deterrence?
Answer. In November 2023, the Department of State announced the
Bureau of Arms Control, Deterrence, and Stability (ADS), the new name
of the Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance. This name
change offers an opportunity for the Bureau to better reflect the work
it has done for a long time.
Deterrence is a cross-cutting function which forms a significant
component within several of our offices' portfolios and these efforts
are closely coordinated with the interagency, particularly with the
Department of Defense (DoD). To that end, the Bureau is currently
staffed at approximately 170 foreign policy professionals, including
civil servants, Foreign Service officers, contractors, fellows,
military advisors, and interagency detailees. The Office of Strategic
Stability and Deterrence Affairs partners with DoD to conduct extended
deterrence dialogues and leads State Department input into the Nuclear
Posture Review and the President's Nuclear Employment Guidance. The
Office of Multilateral and Nuclear Affairs deters nuclear weapons
testing and increases the costs of adversaries' testing programs by
supporting the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty's International
Monitoring System. The Office of Chemical and Biological Weapons
Affairs deters the development and use of chemical and biological
weapons by working through multilateral organizations to hold
accountable those who use them, as well as strengthen the
implementation of and institutions around the Chemical Weapons
Convention and the Biological Weapons Convention. The Office of
Emerging Security Challenges contributes to interagency efforts to
deter undesirable activities in contested domains such as space,
underseas, the polar regions, and assesses the potential impact of
emerging technologies on arms control. The work we do to advance the
science and technology of verification deters weapons testing,
deployment, use, and noncompliance with agreements. All ADS offices
play parts in ensuring that arms control and deterrence are
complementary, mutually reinforcing and that we clearly communicate
U.S. policies and interests to foreign governments to help deter them
from acting contrary to U.S. interests.
Question. How many personnel in the Bureau spend the preponderance
of their time working on the implementation of arms control agreements?
Answer. All ADS offices play parts in ensuring that arms control
and deterrence are mutually reinforcing and that we clearly communicate
U.S. policies and interests to foreign governments to help deter them
from acting contrary to U.S. interests. Arms control, like deterrence,
is a cross-cutting function which forms a significant portion within
several of our offices' portfolios. To that end, the Bureau is
currently staffed at approximately 170 foreign policy professionals,
including civil servants, Foreign Service officers, contractors,
fellows, military advisors, and interagency detailees.
Reliance on deterrence alone will not solve the various security
challenges we face. Arms control and risk reduction complement
deterrence and are essential pieces to the puzzle of strategic
stability. Moreover, arms control is a more expansive concept than
treaties--it enhances our security by establishing norms and measures
of responsible behavior on issues such as destructive direct-ascent
anti-satellite testing, the military uses of AI, and radiological
weapons.
Question. What role does the Department of State play in setting
U.S. policy as it relates to deterrence?
Answer. The Department of State plays active roles in informing,
developing, implementing, and communicating U.S. deterrence policy both
to adversaries and to our allies and partners. State participates in
the Nuclear Posture Review process and contributes to deliberations on
the President's nuclear employment guidance. With the Department of
Defense, State co-chairs extended deterrence dialogues with Australia,
Japan, and the Republic of Korea. State also participates in NATO's
deterrence bodies. State helps further ensure that arms control, risk
reduction, nonproliferation, and deterrence mutually reinforce each
other to protect and advance U.S. security interests.
Question. What are the specific deterrence tools available to the
State Department?
Answer. Deterrence is about influencing adversary calculations,
particularly that the risks and/or costs of a possible action outweigh
its benefit. Engaging and influencing foreign governments is what the
Department of State does every day. Through diplomacy, State gains
insights into foreign government capabilities, thinking, and values to
help inform effective deterrence and to communicate it persuasively.
This includes refuting adversary disinformation about U.S. deterrence
policies. It further includes shaping norms with other governments to
stigmatize unwanted actions and aggression. State also helps craft the
tools that enable attribution and accountability that can provide a
further deterrent to those contemplating transgressing their norms or
obligations. The Department is also at the forefront of strengthening
alliances--the United States' greatest strategic asset--and enhancing
interoperability with allies to make potential aggression more
daunting. State also partners with the Department of Defense in
strategic messaging to deter foreign governments and assure allies and
partners.
Question. Why doesn't the Deterrence Bureau co-chair the U.S.-ROK
Nuclear Consultative Group?
Answer. The Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG) is a forum more
focused on Department of Defense capabilities and responsibilities in
nuclear contingencies. The broader U.S.-ROK Extended Deterrence
Strategy and Consultation Group (EDSCG), which State co-chairs, looks
at how to use all available levers of power--diplomatic, informational,
military, and economic--to strengthen and reinforce U.S. security
commitments to the ROK. While not an NCG co-chair, State participates
in the NCG and leads some of its work streams.
