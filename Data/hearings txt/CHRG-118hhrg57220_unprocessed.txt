The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:38 a.m., in Room 310, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. Mark Green  presiding. Present: Representatives Green, McCaul, Higgins, Guest, Bishop, Gimenez, Pfluger, Garbarino, Greene, Gonzales, Ezell, D'Esposito, Lee, Luttrell, Strong, Brecheen, Crane, Thompson, Jackson Lee, Swalwell, Carter, Correa, Thanedar, Magaziner, Ivey, Goldman, Garcia, Ramirez, Menendez, Clarke, and Titus. Chairman Green. The Committee on Homeland Security will come to order. Without objection, the Chair may declare the committee in recess at any point. The purpose of this hearing is to receive testimony on President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas' open border policies and how these failed policies have had a profound and devastating impact throughout our country. This is the second hearing in this committee's impeachment proceedings regarding Secretary Mayorkas. I now recognize myself for an opening statement. Last week, this committee opened impeachment proceedings against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. This is not a policy difference. The truth is Secretary Mayorkas has disregarded court orders, laws passed by the U.S. Congress, and has lied to the American people. Who wants a Secretary that can just disregard the fundamental pillars of the Constitution? We can't tolerate that, whether they are a Republican or a Democrat. That is what we got out of our hearing last week. Today we are here to examine the impact of those actions on the American people and launch into the substance and human cost of Secretary Mayorkas' open border policies. As a result of the reckless actions by Secretary Mayorkas, no American is safe. There is a fentanyl epidemic sweeping this Nation. Roughly 150,000 Americans died from fentanyl poisoning in 2021 and 2022. That is more than the number of U.S. combat deaths in World War I and the Vietnam War combined. Fentanyl is ripping apart our families and destroying our communities. Over 50 percent of this poison is being smuggled from Mexico into Arizona before it is dispersed throughout the United States. The Grand Canyon State is on the front lines of this crisis, which is why we have had testimony by people who have related the impacts on that State. Now, you will hear many of my colleagues on the left claim that fentanyl is a ports of entry problem. But in reality, just last year, the Border Patrol intercepted enough fentanyl between the ports of entry to kill every single American. That is just what we have caught. We have no idea how much more fentanyl was brought in by the nearly 1.8 million known gotaways, not to mention the unknown gotaways. Border officials have told this committee in testimony that only 5 to 10 percent of the fentanyl coming across the border is actually seized. By redirecting so many Border Patrol agents from patrolling the border to assist with the processing and release of illegal aliens, Secretary Mayorkas has made it far easier to smuggle fentanyl across the Southwest Border. Because of Secretary Mayorkas' border crisis, American cities and neighborhoods are less safe. Secretary Mayorkas' refusal to enforce the law, which requires him to detain and remove illegal aliens, has tragically increased crime and endangered public safety across the country. Since fiscal year 2021, the Border Patrol arrested more than 41,000 aliens with criminal convictions, including more than 15,000 in fiscal year 2023. That is up from just a little over 4,200 in fiscal year 2019. Total convictions for assault, battery, and domestic violence among illegal aliens apprehended in fiscal year 2023 exceeded 1,200, compared to 299 in fiscal year 2019. These statistics do not reflect the illegal aliens with criminal records who have slipped through the system because agents just don't have enough time or information to vet them. Additionally, DHS has no way to determine if an alien has a criminal history in his home country unless that country reports the information to the U.S. Government or the alien self-reports. Therefore, DHS is mainly only screening aliens at the border to determine if they have previously committed a crime in the United States. Because many of these aliens are coming to the United States for the first time, DHS has no idea whether they have a criminal history or not. On top of rushing the vetting process, Secretary Mayorkas is hamstringing ICE, making it easier for illegal aliens who commit crimes in the United States to stay here. Despite his supposed pledge to focus on removing threats to public safety, ICE is arresting fewer criminal illegal aliens than previous administrations. In fiscal year 2019, out of more than 143 administrative arrests, 86 percent were of criminal aliens. In fiscal year 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it was 90 percent. Last fiscal year, a mere 43 percent. The consequences of this influx of criminal aliens is simply devastating. Again, as a result, no American is safe. Illegal aliens arriving in major cities like New York and Chicago are committing assault, theft, and even more heinous crimes. In one case, Daniel Hernandez Martinez, who arrived in New York in June 2023, has since committed at least 14 crimes, leading to 6 arrests, including the day after he arrived in New York City. In one instance, he ``grabbed a stranger by the hair, dragged her across the floor, and kicked her.'' Crimes stemming from illegal migrants are also happening in small towns across America. In May 2023, a Honduran national was charged with raping a teenage girl in a restaurant bathroom in Prattville, Alabama. He had a prior criminal record in Honduras when apprehended, crossing into Texas illegally in November 2021, but he was released into the interior anyway. As we learned in last week's hearing, as many as 85 percent of illegal aliens are currently being released on Secretary Mayorkas' watch. The Secretary himself admitted this during a trip to Eagle Pass just last week. How could we forget the story of the Tambunga family, Elisa Tambunga and her father and sister, who sat across from us in this very hearing room. Elisa lost her little 7-year-old Emilia and her grandmother Maria in a car crash caused by a human smuggler. We will sadly hear similar stories today. These crimes were wholly preventable. Yet Secretary Mayorkas' policies enabled these criminals to enter our country and destroy these families' lives. It is despicable. While many of my Democrat colleagues likely feel the same sympathy for you and your family that I do, I would like to ask them to please turn that sympathy into action. It is hypocritical to come up here, offer your thoughts and prayers, and then leave, continuing to double down on the policies that allow criminals and fentanyl into our country. The people suffering from this border crisis don't need platitudes. They need an end to these illegal policies and to see the man responsible for implementing them held to account. That's what Republicans are doing here today. Migrants are also suffering as a result of Secretary Mayorkas' actions. On Secretary Mayorkas' watch, a record number of migrants have been found dead on U.S. soil. Since the start of fiscal year 2022, CBP no longer even publicly reports the number, but Dr. Corinne Stern, the medical examiner in Webb County, Texas, said in August 2022, and I quote, ``I'm seeing an extreme increase in the number of border crossing deaths compared to other years. This is my busiest year in my career ever.'' Many of those who survive the journey have horror stories as well. Sadly, numerous migrants suffer sexual abuse and assault along the way. Then San Diego Sector Chief Patrol Agent Aaron Heitke told our committee in May, and I quote, ``It's very common that female migrants are raped during the process. Most of them believe it's just part of the payment as they go up.'' This hearing is about the human cost of Secretary Mayorkas' egregious misconduct and failure to fulfill his oath of office. The Framers of our Constitution were clear that the Executive branch officials were expected to follow their duty and enforce the laws of this country, and if they willfully failed to do so, they should no longer hold office. That is why we are here today. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses and letting them tell their stories about how this crisis has impacted them. Unfortunately, one of our witnesses, Sheriff Dannels, was not able to make it at the last minute, but we look forward to hearing from him at a future hearing or on a future border trip. With his permission, I would ask unanimous consent to submit his testimony for the record. Without objection, so ordered.  Prepared Statement of Mark Dannels January 18, 2024 Good afternoon Chairman (Mark) Green, Ranking Member (Bennie) Thompson and the Honorable Members of both subcommittees. On behalf the citizens of Cochise County and the State of Arizona, and my fellow sheriffs, thank you for having me. I have served our border communities for 40 years and prior to that, as a member of our military serving in the U.S. Army stationed at Fort Huachuca located within Cochise County. I have always been a genuine believer in my oath of office to protect my country, and now my county as the duly-elected sheriff for the past 12 years. I am the past-president of the Arizona Sheriffs Association, chair of the National Sheriffs Association Border Security, the Executive Board for Western States Sheriffs and past leadership positions with the Southwest Border Sheriffs. All these associations share 3 objectives: Public Safety, National Security, and Humanitarian. In my submitted brief,* I have shared with you all an overview of Cochise County and the history of our border. I have personally experienced the good, the bad, and the ugly of being a border county. My office has always addressed border-related crimes, smuggling of both illicit drugs, humans, weapons, and cash by our transnational organizations i.e. criminal cartels. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- * Attachments have been retained in committee files. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- I am proud of our relationships with all our law enforcement partners that serve our communities. To begin, I want to ``thank'' our Customs & Border Patrol officers and agents who have worked tirelessly and diligently to protect this great Nation. I want to ``thank'' our Governors; Ducey and Hobbs, and our State congressional members for all their support. The men and women of the Cochise County Sheriffs Office for their dedication and commitment in keeping our communities safe. To all my fellow sheriffs that stand united for the Rule of Law in the protection of their communities. And, finally, I want to ``thank'' my citizens for their patience and support in a time of crisis and disarray. To best understand my presentation is to understand where we were over 3 years ago. My county was one on the safest border counties based on our collective governmental efforts, prioritization, messaging and yes, enforcement efforts supported by the Rule of Law. the direct impact to my county/office My citizens and law enforcement address mostly got-aways ``Fight & Flight'' in my county versus those giving up. 100 percent camouflaged migrants being illegally smuggled by the cartels, price tag per UDA begins at $7,000 and up. These smugglers include juveniles being recruited via social media by the criminal cartels. Border-related booking (detention) costs over the last 24 months is $9.4 million, absorbed by my local and State taxpayers. border-related crime at an all-time high Death/murder investigations, illicit drug poisonings, aggravated acts against my citizens, failure to yields, search and rescue/ recovery, and yes, assaults against law enforcement officials. My deputies/law enforcement continue to be placed in life- threatening scenarios as the cartels shows no regard for my citizens and/or those that wear a badge. Agents, troopers, deputies, and officers are addressing dangerous scenarios/criminals as a direct result of an ``open border'' exploited by these criminal cartels for violence, fear, and greed. cochise county sheriff's office detention bookings related to border In calendar years 2022/2023: 2,884 suspects booked into my jail for border-related crimes, 566 smugglers (State law violation), 414 failure to yields, 154 non-citizens, $9.4 million cost to local/State. Fentanyl continues to poison/kill Americans at an alarming rate leaving families and communities devasted. Arizona efforts by law enforcement are remarkable, but the war on drugs must be a priority topic and not deserted by political rhetoric. Arizona fentanyl seizures accounts for 51 percent of all the fentanyl seized in the country. In Federal fiscal year 2022 Arizona seized over 60 million Fentanyl pills. The 4 Arizona border counties seized 35 million Fentanyl pills with an anticipated increase for 2023 Federal fiscal year. In closing, my fellow sheriffs and I have tried to partner with this administration to include the President of the United States with high hopes to share a collective message, collective action plan, support the rule of law, prioritize our Southern Border, and provide updates reference community impacts and concerns with little to no success. By allowing our border security mission and immigration laws to be discretionary, these criminal cartels continue to be the true winners, their exploitation of mankind is simply ``modern day slavery''; allowing thousands of pounds of illicit drugs into our country that continue to erode the core values of families, schools, and subsequently killing Americans on an average of 290 every day is completely unacceptable at any level. Experiencing migrant deaths without a reasonable process while Members of our U.S. Congress and this administration intentionally avoids reality is gross negligence. Our voice of reason has been buried during what I call an ``intellectual avoidance'' by this administration and yes, Members of U.S. Congress. Communities have been neglected and abandoned relying on our own local and State resources to address a border that is in crisis mode. Our Southern Border, against all public well-designed statements out of Washington, DC is in the worst shape I have ever seen it. When one looks at public safety, national security, and humanitarian, our Southern Border is the largest crime scene in the country. The morale of agents is extremely low, and the collective frustration is very high amongst law enforcement at all levels and most important, our citizens. I am a true believer that Customs and Border Patrol are the experts of border security while sheriffs and police chiefs are the experts of community: together, this is a recipe of success for all communities! I will leave you with this final statement: we all serve the priorities of Americans based on our shared oaths of office to keep them safe, enhance their quality of life, and support the rule of law absent political affiliation or the concern of reelection; I ask each one of you to reflect on this statement as you make your next decision to vote. Once again, I thank this committee for the invite and opportunity and now, stand ready to answer any questions by Members. Chairman Green. Last, I would like to point out that I have invited Secretary Mayorkas on multiple occasions to testify on the border crisis, including this hearing today. I am disappointed that he has chosen not to testify. Instead, he plays games and cat-and-mouse, telling the media he wants to cooperate with the committee on finding a time to testify, but then refuses to work with the committee staff or offer any dates or times to which he can testify. Despite this behavior, and in lieu of his in-person testimony, I have invited him to submit testimony for the record, and I sincerely hope that he takes advantage of that offer. I would like to ask unanimous consent for my letters inviting Secretary Mayorkas for testimony dated August 16, September 14, January 5, and January 7 to be entered into the record. Without objection, so ordered.  Letters Submitted by Chairman Mark E. Green August 16, 2023 The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas. Secretary, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Washington, DC 20528. Dear Secretary Mayorkas: Throughout the 118th Congress, the Committee on Homeland Security (Committee), as the House of Representatives' primary committee of jurisdiction for the Department of Homeland Security (Department), prioritized and will continue oversight of the Department and the enforcement policies responsible for an unprecedented border security crisis. As the Department's Secretary, your testimony will significantly benefit the Committee's oversight and provide the American public improved transparency and accountability. Therefore, the Committee invites you to testify at an agreeable date and time during the week of October 23, 2023. The scope of the hearing will primarily focus on border security with an emphasis on examining the actions and policies implemented since January 2021 and their impacts on the border and throughout the interior of the country. Please contact the Committee on Homeland Security Majority Staff at (202) 226-8417 with any questions or to confirm your attendance. The Committee sincerely hopes that you accept this invitation to testify. Sincerely, Mark E. Green, M.D., Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security. ______ September 18, 2023. The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas, Secretary, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Washington, DC, 20528. Dear Secretary Mayorkas: I am in receipt of your response to my August 16th letter that requested you to appear before the Committee on Homeland Security to testify on the unprecedented border security crisis. As you know, I requested your testimony at a mutually agreeable time during the week of October 23, 2023, as part of our on-going oversight work. The Committee on Homeland Security is the House of Representatives' primary committee of jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security. Your response seems to request a deferral of your testimony to the Committee's annual Worldwide Threats hearing. As is the tradition of this Committee, I intend to schedule the Worldwide Threats hearing this fall, separate from the hearing I describe in my August 16th letter. Just last week, the Department released its Annual Homeland Threat Assessment stating that the Department `` . . . continues to identify a high risk of foreign and domestic terrorism in 2024'' The assessment describes a `` . . . diverse and dynamic threat environment.'' The dynamic and diverse nature of the threats we face is why I intend for the Worldwide Threats hearing to cover the wide range of threats, including threats to our infrastructure, cybersecurity, economic security, aviation security, faith-based communities, as well as our very way of life. Testimony from DHS, the FBI, and NCTC always give the Committee a wide breadth of topics to explore and to question witnesses about. I also anticipate that border security will be an inevitable point of discussion in that hearing. Your letter states that ``order security is an essential aspect of DHS's core mission . . . ''. I could not agree more. However, because of the unprecedented crisis at the border, your testimony on border security, at a hearing focused solely on border security, is essential for the Committee to fulfill its oversight obligations to the crisis by receiving answers to the many questions we have that are specific to the Department. The Committee takes its oversight responsibilities very seriously and would appreciate your participation and insight in order to understand the entirety of the dynamic threat environment you mention in your report. I therefore request that you make yourself available for testimony at both hearings. I look forward to and request your response by September 25, 2023. Sincerely, Mark E. Green, M.D. Chairman. ______ January 5, 2024. The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas, Secretary, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Washington, DC 20528. Dear Secretary Mayorkas: I am in receipt of your responses to my August 16, 2023 and September 18, 2023 letters, declining to appear before the Committee on Homeland Security (Committee) to testify exclusively on the unprecedented border security crisis. I am writing again to reiterate my request. The Committee recently completed its nearly year-long investigation into the border crisis. As the Department's Secretary, your testimony is vital to the Committee's oversight and to providing the American public with complete transparency and accountability. Also, as you are aware, articles for your impeachment were filed in the House of Representatives and were referred to the Committee in November. Accordingly, we have initiated impeachment proceedings, of which your testimony will be a part. As the House of Representatives' primary committee of jurisdiction for the Department, the Committee takes its responsibilities very seriously. I request your participation in an afternoon hearing on January 18, 2024. I request and look forward to your response by January 10, 2024. Sincerely, Mark E. Green, M.D., Chairman. ______ January 17, 2024. The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas, Secretary, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Washington, DC, 20528. Dear Secretary Mayorkas: I am in receipt of your response to my letter requesting your appearance before the Committee on Homeland Security to testify at our January 18th hearing. I was looking forward to your in-person testimony and am disappointed that you declined to appear. As stated in earlier letters to you, your perspective on the crisis at the border and actions you have taken as secretary are valuable for the Members of the Committee and the American public to hear. Regretfully, every invitation for almost half a year we extended to you to testify focused specifically on the border crisis has been rejected or subject to endless delay tactics. Since you continue to decline to come in person, I invite you to submit written testimony for the January 18th hearing record, so that our Committee Members may hear from you directly. If you accept my invitation, please submit your testimony to the Committee's chief clerk, Sean Corcoran, at sean.corcoran@mail.house.gov. The official hearing record will be held open for 10 days following the conclusion of the hearing. The Committee sincerely hopes that you will accept this invitation. Sincerely, Mark E. Green, M.D., Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security.

Chairman Green. I now recognize the Ranking Member, the gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Thompson, for his opening statement. Mr. Thompson. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Good morning. Before we begin today's hearing, I want to address misinformation my Republican colleagues are spreading, falsely alleging that Secretary Mayorkas is refusing to testify before this committee. Let me set the record straight. Secretary Mayorkas has testified before Congress more than any other Cabinet Secretary. He has appeared before this committee twice in the last year, including just 2 months ago when he testified for several hours about border security. His willingness to work with the committee has been a welcome change from the Trump administration, whose officials consistently refused to comply with Congressional oversight. They ignored virtually every oversight letter and even defied a subpoena for their so-called Acting Secretary to appear before the committee. Secretary Mayorkas, however, has been forthright in dealing with Congress. In response to the Chairman's request to testify at today's hearing on January 11, 2024, the Secretary sent a letter agreeing to make himself available to testify at a future mutually agreed-upon date. However, the Chairman has refused to accept. Instead, Republicans sent angry letters and tweets accusing the Secretary of refusing to testify, knowing full well he said he would appear. Republicans are acting in bad faith. Unfortunately, that is nothing new. Months ago, Chairman Green promised donors at a campaign event that he would bring an impeachment case against Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas. He told his contributors to, ``Get the popcorn,'' and promised, ``it's going to be fun.'' Before the committee had even begun its inquiry, Republicans had predetermined the outcome. But why did Republicans invite the Secretary to testify, only to refuse his offer to appear? The answer to that question appeared in The Hill newspaper last night. Mr. Chair, I asked unanimous consent to include in the record this article from The Hill, describing how Republicans had set the date for the markup of Articles of Impeachment before holding the first hearing on this subject. Chairman Green. Without objection, so ordered.  Article Submitted by Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson gop memo shows plans for mayorkas impeachment markup on jan. 31 By Rebecca Beitsch--01/17/24 6:47 PM ET, The Hill An internal Republican memo shows the House Homeland Security Committee decided last week it would mark up an impeachment resolution for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas at the end of the month. The memo, obtained by The Hill, came the same day that the committee kicked off its series of impeachment hearings--and amid complaints from Democrats the proceedings have been rushed to back a predetermined conclusion. It appears to show Republicans have committed to a timeline with little flexibility to accommodate additional promised hearings or testimony from Mayorkas himself. The plans outlined in the memo--which Republicans shared inadvertently--track with a pledge by Chair Mark Green (R-Tenn.) to swiftly consider a resolution to boot Mayorkas from his job. But asked about its contents, Green said he was not putting any timeline out and that he would not ``corroborate a memo.'' ``I'm not confirming or denying any dates or times,'' Green told The Hill. His colleague on the panel, however, backed the timeline of the memo. Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) told reporters he expected the articles of impeachment to drop Jan. 31. The memo appears to be a document to prepare Green for a Jan. 11 meeting, prompting him to remind other GOP committee members about a Jan. 18 meeting to ``strategize for the impeachment articles.'' ``We have scheduled the markup for impeachment articles at 10 o'clock AM ET on Wednesday, January 31, 2024,'' the memo says under a section labeled as ``announcements.'' The memo comes amid a broader battle over whether Mayorkas--who has said he is willing to appear before the panel--will get chance to testify in the hearings. While in late December, Green told Fox News they would hold ``three or four hearings . . . and then we will do a proceeding in January,'' the second hearing in the series slated for Thursday could be their last. The House is still set to take a weeklong recess next week, returning in the final days of January and leaving just 1 day for any other committee activity ahead of a mark up. Green had asked Mayorkas 2 weeks in advance to appear at Thursday's hearing, but the secretary had a scheduling conflict while hosting a delegation from Mexico to discuss border issues, asking to instead find another date. The memo was drafted the day before the panel heard from Mayorkas that he would be unable to meet on Jan. 18. Green earlier Wednesday fired off a letter saying that if Mayorkas could not make tomorrow's hearing, he could submit written testimony instead. Rep. Bennie Thompson (Miss.), the top Democrat on the panel, said the little lead time in scheduling the hearing with Mayorkas was a contrast with usual efforts to schedule cabinet officials months in advance. ``You notified the guy last week, who, you know, has the third- largest agency in government that `We want you to testify next week. Oh, and by the way, we want you to be on the second panel,' '' Thompson said. The committee still plans to hear from a sheriff and parents who lost children to gang violence and fentanyl. Green has pointed to previous invitations in August and September for Mayorkas to testify that were not accepted, though the secretary has appeared before the panel twice in the last year. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the disagreement over setting a date amounted to a ``rush to impeach'' on Green's part. ``This is just the latest example of Committee Republicans' sham process. It's abundantly clear that they are not interested in hearing from Secretary Mayorkas since it doesn't fit into their bad-faith, predetermined and unconstitutional rush to impeach him. Last week, the Secretary offered to testify publicly before the Committee; in the time since, the Committee failed to respond to DHS to find a mutually agreeable date,'' DHS spokesperson Mia Ehrenberg said in a statement. ``Instead, they provided this offer of written testimony to the media before any outreach to the Department.  Republicans have yet again demonstrated their preference for playing politics rather than work together to address the serious issues at the border.'' Green wouldn't tell The Hill Wednesday whether he would shift the schedule to accommodate Mayorkas. ``I said this all along, but I would change my timeline if a reason to do so came up,'' he said. ``Mayorkas's passive aggressiveness about trying to schedule us is a smokescreen. That's all it is. And we're just not going to play that game. We've been after him to come since August. And he keeps saying no,'' Green said. ``So we're not playing the game anymore.'' Mr. Thompson. According to an internal Republican memo dated January 10, 2024, Republicans had already scheduled a committee vote to impeach the Secretary prior to holding a single impeachment hearing. Just as we have said all along, the outcome of Republicans' so-called impeachment investigation has been predetermined from the start. The Chairman promised to follow the facts, but Republicans never really intended to do so. They are hurrying to adhere to an artificial time line, agreed in a backroom deal between Republican leadership, who are holding on by a thread and its most extreme MAGA members. This isn't a real impeachment. It is a MAGA spectacle paid for by American tax dollars for Republican political gain. But through it all, Secretary Mayorkas remained committed to doing his job, the Department of Homeland Security's mission, and the men and women who serve with him at DHS. The Secretary is also committed to work diligently on a bipartisan basis to secure necessary funding for border security and to prepare the Department for a possible shutdown. I wish my Republican colleagues would engage the Secretary to provide the Department the funding it needs, but they have refused. I look forward to continuing to work with Secretary Mayorkas on critical homeland security issues facing the country and commend him for his unwavering commitment to duty even in the face of this sham impeachment. I also note for the record when I asked at last week's hearing about providing the Secretary due process during the committee's impeachment proceedings, the Chairman gave no substantive answers to my repeated inquiries. In fact, he seemed to have even considered providing the Secretary due process and appeared unprepared to respond. This is unfortunate, but not surprising. Again, this isn't a real impeachment. It is a predetermined, preplanned, partisan political stunt. Yesterday, the Chairman threatened to hold Secretary Mayorkas in contempt for failing to appear before the committee, even though the Secretary has already agreed to appear. That is not how contempt works. I can't help but wonder if Republicans are getting a bit desperate, especially after their hearing last week was a flop. It fell flat after their witnesses, three Republican politicians, rehashed old partisan talking points without so much as a shred of evidence to support their politically- motivated claims for impeachment. The Democratic witness, respected impeachment expert and Constitutional scholar, Professor Frank Bowman testified, ``Policy differences, no matter how severe, no matter how heated, are simply not grounds for impeachment.'' You cannot impeach a Cabinet Secretary because you don't like a President's policies. That is not what impeachment is for. That is not what the Constitution says. Unfortunately, Republicans are willing to damage the Constitution they claim to hold dear because they think it will benefit them politically. Which brings us to today's hearing. I want to begin by expressing my deepest sympathies to Mrs. Noble and Mrs. Dunn on the tragic loss of your children. I cannot fathom your pain. As a father and a grandfather my heart truly goes out to you. Indeed, our hearts go out to all those who have lost loved ones to drugs and violence. We are committed to helping prevent future tragedies. Democrats want to strengthen border security. We want to keep fentanyl off our streets. We want to keep communities safe. We want to help those struggling with addiction. But impeachment will not do any of that. The fact is, impeachment is a waste of precious time that could be used to legislate on the urgent issues, if only Republicans were willing to do it. The Democratic witness today, Professor Deborah Pearlstein, is a Constitutional law scholar. But in addition to her knowledge of impeachment, she has great expertise on the awesome power vested in Congress by the Constitution to affect change for the American people. That power is not through impeachment. As Professor Pearlstein stated in her testimony, and I quote, ``Impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas can have no impact on the administration's exercise of immigration enforcement discretion, a power the Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized is vested by the Constitution and Executive branch.'' Instead, Congress power comes from its ability to legislate. As Professor Pearlstein goes on to say, ``No branch of government has more power under our Constitution to address matters of border security than Congress.'' In other words, it is up to Congress to provide funding to interdict fentanyl, fix our broken immigration system, and provide help for those suffering from opioid addiction. That is our role in this, to use the power provided under the Constitution to legislate on important issues, to help people who need it most and not some baseless, senseless impeachment. I look forward to hearing from Professor Pearlstein about Congress' power to make meaningful progress on these and other issues. Mr. Chairman, I made this plea to you last week. It fell on deaf ears, but I will try again. Let's drop this baseless impeachment and get back to doing the real work of securing the homeland and helping people across this great country. Before I yield back, Mr. Chairman, I have a parliamentary inquiry. I would like to give you another chance at this one. Chairman Green. You are recognized. Mr. Thompson. Mr. Chairman, during our hearing last week, you said, ``The committee will follow the rules of the House,'' with regard to Secretary Mayorkas' due process. What provisions of House rule XI grants the Secretary representation before this committee? Chairman Green. Just a question of clarification on the parliamentary proceeding. What rule are you citing? Mr. Thompson. Rule XI. Chairman Green. Rule XI? The Secretary is not appearing before the committee today, so his counsel is not necessary. Mr. Thompson. Mr. Chairman, we all know that Secretary Mayorkas has been willing to appear before this committee. He is not running from anything. He has been to the Capitol Hill 27 times since he was sworn in. My question is about due process. There is nothing in the standing House rules that protects the Secretary's rights. So, Mr. Chairman, pursuant to clause 2(j)(1) of rule XI, I am furnishing you with a demand for a Minority day hearing on this subject signed by all the Democratic Members of this committee. Chairman Green. So the demand is not proper. You have a witness present, so. This one before, right? Mr. Thompson. Yeah. This is the unanimous consent that included in the record the article. But also, I have this request for the---- Chairman Green. You want this included in the record? Is that what you are asking? Mr. Thompson. Well, that is a request for a Minority date for the committee. Chairman Green. OK. So as I understand the rules, the request is only in order when you don't have a witness present. Today you have a witness present, so this is not in order. Mr. Goldstein. Mr. Chairman, may I make a parliamentary inquiry on that? Chairman Green. Yeah. Mr. Goldstein. Is this an impeachment inquiry? Chairman Green. You want to read the request? Yeah. This is actually a hearing, not an inquiry. Mr. Goldstein. Is this part of an impeachment investigation? Chairman Green. This is an impeachment hearing. Mr. Goldstein. OK. Under impeachment precedent, separate and apart from this particular hearing, the Minority is allowed to have a hearing of its own choice and its own witnesses. That has happened in every single impeachment in history. If this is going to be an impeachment process, then there have to be rights and due process afforded to the individual who is being impeached. Part of that historically, under historic precedent, is that there is a Minority day with Minority-determined witnesses, not a Minority witness who is added to a hearing that the Majority determines. Chairman Green. So I want to make clear this supposed misinformation about the request to Secretary Mayorkas. There have been multiple, multiple requests, 4 in fact, of me to ask him to come and be a part of this, and he has to the press said yes, to me not provided any dates. At some date in the future. That is stonewalling. So at some point, after 4, I finally said, I guess it was Monday, well just send us a testimony in writing. So far, we haven't seen that either. The effort to give Secretary Mayorkas an opportunity to come before the committee in this context has been made many times. I appreciate that the Ranking Member pointed out that he has been in front of our committee, but that was mandated by, you know, the threats briefing. That is what he came for, was the threats briefing, not a part of this investigation on the Southwest Border. Every time we have invited him, he has refused to give us a date to come. So he has been afforded an opportunity to come. Mr. Goldstein. I understand that. That is a separate issue, whether or not Mr. Mayorkas wants to take part in his own impeachment inquiry. But the question for you is that as part of the House impeachment process, there must be afforded to the Minority a hearing that the Minority gets to determine because it is an impeachment process, it is not a normal oversight investigation. What Secretary Mayorkas wants to do is a separate matter. I understand your view and I understand, you know, the Ranking Member has a different view. I am sure we will get all of the different letters in the record. You know, I have an article here saying that the DHS letter contradicts the GOP claim that Mayorkas refused to testify, which I could enter by unanimous consent. But we are just talking right now about the impeachment process. In this committee, where it has never been done before, it is normally in the Judiciary Committee, that there has to be a Minority day with Minority-determined witnesses. Chairman Green. I appreciate the letter, and we will take it into consideration. Mr. Ranking Member, you are recognized for the remainder of your opening statement. Mr. Thompson. Well, let me ask unanimous consent that that be included in the record. Chairman Green. Without objection, so ordered.   Mr. Thompson. So, Mr. Chairman, rule XI does not mention anything about having a Minority witness at any given hearing. It only provides for a Minority date. I refer the Chair to page 599 of the House rules manual. Chairman Green. Were you asking a question, Mr. Ranking Member? Mr. Thompson. Yes. I mean, we didn't ask about a witness. We asked for a date. Chairman Green. Yes, I saw the letter. We have entered it into the record, and we want to continue with this hearing. We will address that later. Mr. Thompson. No? Well, Mr. Chairman, this committee cannot proceed to any marker. I know that you have long planned in which you committed to the Speaker and to a Member of this committee behind closed doors without a full hearing of the merits of impeachment. But a Minority day on an impeachment is allowed by the rules. Chairman Green. Thank you. Mr. Thompson. So we are just trying to---- Chairman Green. No, I appreciate you---- Mr. Thompson. Do you plan to honor that? Chairman Green. We are going to take it into consideration, and I will meet with you later to talk about it. Mr. Thompson. Well---- Chairman Green. Do you have any other comments for your opening remarks? Mr. Thompson. Well, it is a simple request. It is in the rules, and we just want the rules to be followed. Chairman Green. There is an interpretation disagreement on this. Our parliamentarian says that you are entitled to witnesses and not a specific hearing. We will take a look at it after this and you and I can talk about it then. Mr. Magaziner. Mr. Ranking Member, will you yield for a question? I just want to make sure, because I don't think it was entered into the record before, the Ranking Member referred to the letter that counsel of Secretary Mayorkas sent to the committee on January 11. Chairman Green. If I could, Mr. Magaziner, this is his opening statement, not his 5 minutes. He can yield time to you in his 5 minutes. Mr. Magaziner. OK. I was just going to ask unanimous consent that the letter be entered into the record, but. Chairman Green. I am fine with that. We will break protocol here just a second. If there is no objection, so ordered.  Letter From Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs Zephranie Buetow January 11, 2024. The Honorable Mark E. Green, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC 20510. Dear Chairman Green: Thank you for your January 5, 2024, letter requesting Secretary Mayorkas's participation in a U.S House Committee on Homeland Security (the Committee) hearing on January 18, 2024. I am responding on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Secretary Mayorkas is laser focused on border security. That is why he has diligently worked over the past 3 years to address decades-long border challenges on multiple fronts. For example, this week the Secretary was in Eagle Pass, TX, making his 24th visit to the border since taking office. The Secretary is incredibly grateful to the distinguished men and women who serve in the Department, and proud to serve side-by-side with them. They are on the front lines each day and we owe them a debt of gratitude, and the Secretary has made a commitment to obtain the necessary resources they need to do their jobs. As we all know, our immigration system has been broken for decades. From the start, the Secretary has committed to working with Congress to identify legislative solutions that will improve the current system. To that end, he is fully engaged with Senate Republicans and Democrats in on-going negotiations to craft a supplemental funding package. Current negotiations contemplate significant investments in border security, as well as substantive changes to immigration policy. The Secretary has repeatedly sought legislative reforms on immigration and is working with this group in a good-faith effort to break the gridlock. At the same time, the Secretary is working to address the root causes of this migration, including the broader hemispheric trends that draw refugees, asylum seekers, and migrants from across the Americas. This month alone, he will host a delegation from the Republic of Mexico to address issues of mutual concern, and travel to Central America to hold in-person discussions with other strategic partners in the hemisphere. The Secretary is working tirelessly to foster the close partnership and engagement with our international neighbors that are necessary to address these root causes. The Secretary also continues to engage regularly with Congress. This is evidenced by his participation in 27 congressional hearings to date--more than his predecessors attended during the first 3 years of the prior administration (23), and only one less than during the entire 4 years of the Trump administration (28). These have included 3 hearings in the past 11 weeks. In keeping with the Secretary's commitment to cooperate with congressional Committees, he will make himself available to testify before the Committee. Consistent with the customary accommodations process, we look forward to working through the details with Committee staff and agreeing upon the date and structure of the hearing. As you can appreciate, the Secretary's schedule is quite committed with the work of the Department including hosting Mexican Cabinet Members next week to discuss border enforcement. Thank you again for your invitation. Should you wish to discuss this or any homeland security issue, please contact the DHS Office of Legislative Affairs Respectfully, Zephranie Buetow, Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs. Chairman Green. Mr. Ranking Member, you are recognized still. The Ranking Member yields. Thank you.  Statement of Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson January 18, 2024 Before we begin today's hearing, I want to address misinformation my Republican colleagues are spreading, falsely alleging that Secretary Mayorkas is refusing to testify before this committee. Let me set the record straight. Secretary Mayorkas has testified before Congress more than any other Cabinet Secretary. He has appeared before this committee twice in the last year, including just 2 months ago when he testified for several hours about border security. His willingness to work with the committee has been a welcome change from the Trump administration, whose officials consistently refused to comply with Congressional oversight. They ignored virtually every oversight letter and even defied a subpoena for their so-called ``Acting Secretary'' to appear before the committee. Secretary Mayorkas, however, has been forthright in dealing with Congress. In response to the Chairman's request to testify at today's hearing, on January 11, 2024, the Secretary sent a letter agreeing to make himself available to testify at a future, mutually-agreed-upon date. However, the Chairman refused to accept. Instead, Republicans sent angry letters and tweets accusing the Secretary of refusing to testify, knowing full well he said he would appear. Republicans are acting in bad faith. Unfortunately, that's nothing new.

He told his contributors to ``get the popcorn'' and promised ``it's going to be fun.'' Before the committee had even begun its inquiry, Republicans had predetermined the outcome. But why did Republicans invite the Secretary to testify only to refuse his offer to appear? The answer to that question appeared in The Hill newspaper last night.

Indeed, our hearts go out to all those who have lost loved ones to drugs and violence, and we are committed to helping prevent future tragedies. Democrats want to strengthen border security.

It fell on deaf ears, but I'll try again. Let's drop this baseless impeachment and get back to doing the real work of securing the homeland and helping people across this great country. Chairman Green. Other Members of the committee are reminded that opening statements may be submitted for the record.  Statement of Honorable Sheila Jackson Lee January 18, 2024 Chairman Green, and Ranking Member Thompson, grief and loss that parents feel at the death of a child is unimaginable to those who have not experienced such grief. I would like to take this opportunity, at the outset, to express my condolences to Ms. Tammy Nobles, who lost her daughter Kayla Hamilton who was murdered; and Mrs. Josephine Dunn, who lost her daughter Ashley to fentanyl poisoning. Your presence here is a stark reminder that our children are dying--that we must break the cycle of drug addiction and end the needless loss of life from fentanyl and fentanyl-related overdoses. I regret that today's witnesses have been summoned to participate in an impeachment process hearing, because we do need to hear their testimony to speak to the real underlying threat facing our Nation--a comprehensive effort to address addiction in society. The committee has been well-served over my tenure when it has taken the time to listen to local and State governments on homeland security issues. It is rare that a citizen is asked to testify before the committee on an issue of concern like the impact fentanyl is having on families. I look forward to their testimony: Hon. Mark Dannels, sheriff, Cochise County, Arizona; Tammy Nobles, private citizen; Josephine Dunn, private citizen; and Deborah Pearlstein, director, Program in Law and Public Policy and Charles and Marie Robertson visiting professor in Law and Public Affairs, Princeton University (*Democratic Witness*). As the chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I have worked with families like yours who have lost children to drugs, gangs, and violence. I go where these tragedies happen to remind people that these deaths impact not only parents, but entire communities--like those in Uvalde, Texas where 19 were killed while in their school by gun violence. I am most grateful to parents who struggle through their grief to share their experiences and tell the story of their children's life with others, especially when their loss came at the hands of violence, suicide, or a substance disorder. I join with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in condemning those who traffic in illicit drugs and guns. As the Ranking Member on the House Committee on the Judiciary's Subcommittee on Crime, I have a long resume of efforts to implement reform of laws to favor diversion programs for non-violent drug offenses so that these individuals might receive the help needed to overcome addictions and reclaim lives. Fentanyl is a source of the grief for millions of families who have lost loved ones to a substance disorder, but this grief will not be eased by pointing a finger at the Secretary of Homeland Security and blaming him for their tragedy. Throughout American history this scenario has only lead to more grief and violence that claims more lives needlessly. Republicans may not like the Biden administration's policies, but policy differences are not grounds for impeachment under the Constitution. There is no basis for impeaching Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, for the number of fentanyl deaths in the United States, he is neither a drug lord, nor trafficker of uncontrolled substances. Secretary Mayorkas has not committed ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors''--the United States Constitution's standard; for an impeachment. Secretary Mayorkas is a public servant charged with enforcing the laws of the United States, which include drug interdiction at borders. Secretary Mayorkas is carrying out his duties faithfully. If this committee is stepping up to address the Homeland Security threat posed by substance disorders, then I applaud this effort. However, to do so responsibly we cannot blame a person for a crisis that has been in the making for over 40 years. If we are to end the grip that fentanyl we must address the supply of illicit fentanyl in the United States, and the reduction of demand for drugs that is fueled by addiction. This will require the Federal Government to acknowledge the lessons of previous failed drug wars and embracing inclusive strategies that range from aggressive interdiction to community-based treatment. The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the rise in fentanyl-related overdoses beginning in 2019--as treatment, recovery, and prevention services were interrupted while schools, jobs, and mental health support faltered--especially for those suffering from substance use disorders. While the previous administration was focused on China and building a wall on the Southern Border, fentanyl came in through the front door and exploded on this country. In 2021, fentanyl was linked to more than 1,600 fatal overdoses in Texas, with African Americans becoming the face of a second national wave of fentanyl-related overdoses. Newly-released data shows a heightened rate of overdoses from fentanyl among African Americans, especially among seniors disproportionately affected by fentanyl addiction, despite an overall decline of overdose rates. Far from inaction as the hearing title implies, the Biden administration and Congress have both taken decisive steps to address the scourge of fentanyl. To disrupt the supply chain of fentanyl, Democrats passed the fiscal year 2023 omnibus spending package, which included $60 million to hire 125 additional CEP officers and support personnel at ports of entry and $70 million to strengthen non-intrusive inspection systems to scan vehicles and cargo. This investment in interdiction resources is critical because the fentanyl supply chain crosses an ocean and several international borders. China, and increasingly India, export most of the chemical precursors to Mexico that are used in the early stages of fentanyl production, where Mexican cartels produce illicit fentanyl products for smuggling to the United States. That is why, the Biden administration is working with the Mexican government through several initiatives and redoubling diplomatic efforts to engage China to interrupt this deadly supply chain. Contrary to some expressed opinion, the Mexican cartels primarily use U.S. citizens to drive vehicles and trucks--filled with hard-to- detect packages of synthesized fentanyl--through lawful ports of entry, while couriers carry and send packages through the U.S. Mail and private carriers. There is one major danger posed by the illicit supply of fentanyl that is particularly troubling: the production of fake or counterfeit pills, which have been found in every State, and hold an often-deadly secret. Last year, DEA agents said 4 out of every 10 pills on Houston's streets were laced with fentanyl--leading users to die without knowing what they took. To educate the public, particularly young people and their parents, the Biden administration launched the ``One Pill Can Kill'' public awareness campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of fake prescription pills laced with fentanyl. Because the cartels mass-produce fake pills to resemble other Schedule II prescription opioids such as OxyContin and Percocet, depressants such as Xanax, or stimulants like Adderall, even casual users of illegal drugs can be drawn into the web of the fentanyl trade, with deadly consequences. The hard truth is that we can only temporarily disrupt the supply of illicit of fentanyl temporarily before another cartel, trafficking method, or analogue moves in to take over the market that addiction creates. We can disrupt the flow, but we must also reduce the U.S. demand for these drugs. For far too long, our country has chosen the wrong approach to fighting drug abuse and criminalizing addiction rather than preventing and treating it--particularly, in communities of color. That is why in the last Congress we passed the Rural Opioid Abuse Prevention Act, which several Republicans who sit on this very subcommittee voted against. That legislation provided funding to rural communities to combat the fentanyl crisis in addition to $104 million in grants and assistance the administration allocated to the Rural Communities Opioid Response Program. It is important to stress that we must not make the same mistakes with fentanyl, fentanyl-related substances, or other synthetic opioids. The failed policies of the last 50 years have disproportionately impacted black and brown communities in urban and rural areas. As we learned through the crack epidemic of the 1980's followed by methamphetamine in the 1990's, then prescription drugs, and back to heroin once again--we cannot incarcerate our way out of the scourge of fentanyl and synthetic opioids. I am concerned that banning the Secretary of Homeland Security for fentanyl-related deaths and violence misinforms the public as to the true nature of the threat and risks diversion of needed resources away from research and toward expand mandatory minimum penalties. I also remain opposed to this impeachment process because it is theater, without substance or a commitment to do the work needed to fight fentanyl's grip on so many lives. According to the most recent statistics from the U.S. Sentencing Commission, there are already significant racial disparities in the prosecution of fentanyl trafficking cases, with people of color comprising more than 78 percent of those sentenced in 2021. The same is true for Federal convictions involving fentanyl analogues, of which 86 percent of those sentenced were people of color. Of those prosecuted for fentanyl trafficking, less than 5 percent received a guideline increase for a leadership or supervisory role and less than 10 percent of those prosecuted for fentanyl analogue trafficking received a leadership or supervisory increase. This committee can expound on the record of fentanyl use in the United States, its real costs to Homeland Security and make valuable recommendations on addressing the impact it is having on the stability and viability of communities that are rural, urban, suburban, and exurban. Those who are most visible in the trade in fentanyl are dealers, mules, and couriers, which also the people most easily and quickly replaced within drug trafficking organizations. There is no doubt that we are currently experiencing a crisis. But it's a crisis that Congress and the Biden administration have responded to with urgency and clear eyes. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today and hope to have an earnest discussion about solutions to reduce the supply of fentanyl and combat and prevent addiction and overdoses. Thank you. I yield back the balance of my time. Chairman Green. I am pleased to have a distinguished panel of witnesses before us today. I ask that our witnesses please rise and raise their right hand.  Chairman Green. Let the record reflect that the witnesses have answered in the affirmative. Thank you. You may be seated. I would now like to formally introduce our witnesses, Ms. Tammy Nobles. Ms. Nobles is the mother of a young Maryland woman, Kayla Hamilton, who was raped and murdered in July 2022, allegedly by a 17-year-old El Salvador native and MS-13 member, who had illegally crossed the Southwest Border in March 2022 as an unaccompanied alien child. Ms. Dunn is an Arizona mother who lost her 26-year-old daughter, Ashley Dunn, to fentanyl poisoning in 2021. Since her daughter's passing, Josephine has become an advocate working to stem the scourge that fentanyl is wrecking in the United States. Ms. Deborah Pearlstein is the director of the Princeton Program in Law and Public Policy, and Charles and Marie Robertson visiting professor of law and public affairs. Before joining Princeton, she was professor of law and codirector of the Floersheimer Center for Constitutional Democracy at Cardozo Law School, Yeshiva University, and held visiting appointments at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and Georgetown University Law Center. I thank all the witnesses for being here today. I now recognize Ms. Nobles for 5 minutes to summarize her opening statement. STATEMENT OF TAMMY NOBLES, PRIVATE CITIZEN Ms. Nobles. Good morning and thank you for having me here today. My name is Tammy Nobles. I am the mother of Kayla Hamilton. July 24, 2002, was one of the best days of my life. I gave birth to a beautiful baby girl and named her Kayla Marie. She loved to smile and laugh. She always kept her friends close and never forgot anyone. She was kind, caring, thoughtful, and funny. She loved God. She loved life and God. She showed the world that being yourself was OK and you didn't have to follow everyone else. But sadly, on July 27, 2022, I received the worst news that a parent doesn't want to hear. That my newly 20-year-old daughter, Kayla Hamilton, was murdered in her own room and left on the floor like trash. The illegal MS-13 known gang member brutally raped and murdered my daughter by strangling her with a cord and robbed her of $6. During the attack, Kayla called her boyfriend for help, but went to voicemail. The voicemail of the murderer strangling Kayla was 2 minutes and 30 seconds long. DHS employees failed to visually inspect the assailant by lifting his shirt to check for gang-related tattoos. Had DHS employees performed a visual inspection of the assailant's body, they would have seen MS-13 gang-related tattoos on his body, disqualifying him from entering the United States. DHS employees failed to make a simple phone call to the El Salvador government to verify if assailant was on an MS-13 gang affiliation list. Had they done so, El Salvador government officials would have confirmed that the assailant was a known MS-13 gang member with a prior criminal history. DHS supervisors have failed to train and supervise DHS employees to properly screen minors attempting to enter U.S. soil from El Salvador. The operational neglect committed by DHS carried over into DHHS, whose operational neglect further sealed my daughter's fate. DHHS's operational neglect included its employees violating clearly-articulated protocol requiring a minor to be placed with a verified relative before entering the United States. DHHS employees neglected and recklessly failed to verify a legitimate family member of the assailant or sponsor before allowing him to enter U.S. soil. There were clear inconsistencies in the DHS and DHHS records regarding the identity of the relative to whom the assailant was released. Ultimately, DHHS's failures to--failures, the MS-13 gang member as a minor to rent a room in a trailer park from another individual who was also an illegal immigrant. There was also a lack of transparency by DHS and DHHS, including but not limited to DHHS failure to provide House of Representative Chairman Jim Jordan a copy of its audit report. Let's take a moment and think about how Kayla felt that day, how scared she must have been that day, knowing that she was dying, if she was going to see her mommy again, her baby sister, her brother, or her cat Oreo. Kayla fought for her life that day with all that she had, and in the end, she lost to an individual that wasn't even supposed to be allowed in the country. For me, this is not a political issue. This is a safety issue for everyone living in the United States. This could have been anyone's daughter. I don't want any other parent to live the nightmare that I am living. I am her voice now, and I'm going to fight with everything I have to get her story told and bring awareness of the issue at the border. If we had stricter border policies, my daughter would still be alive today. Nothing will bring my daughter back nor fix the pain of not having her here. But I want to prevent this from happening to someone else's child. This isn't about immigration. This is about protecting everyone in the United States. Thank you.  Prepared Statement of Tammy Nobles January 18, 2024 Good morning and thank you for having me here today. My name is Tammy Nobles. I am the mother of Kayla Hamilton.

STATEMENT OF JOSEPHINE DUNN, PRIVATE CITIZEN Mrs. Dunn. Good morning. Before I begin, I wish to thank you all for the gift of your time. I want to thank you for allowing me to share my beautiful daughter's story. As painful as it is for me to do so, I wish to spare as many parents the unfathomable pain and debilitating grief that I carry every single day. My daughter Ashley has left this Earth 967 days ago. Today would have been her 29th birthday. In the next 5 minutes, you will see many beautiful photos of Ashley on the screens. Photos are all that my family and I have left of her. That's not true. I guess we do have a small amount of ashes in an urn, and we do have our memories. In that same 5 minutes that I get to share her story, after I traveled all the way from Arizona for Mr. Mayorkas not to appear here today, someone else's loved one in the United States will die in this same 5 minutes that I get to speak because of fentanyl. Over the next 24 hours, 190 loved ones in this country will die from fentanyl. Fifty percent of that fentanyl is coming through my State with an open border. The beautiful State of Arizona today will lose 5 people to fentanyl. Five. You see, Arizona recognizes that fentanyl is a weapon of mass destruction. While you see her beautiful smile and almond- shaped eyes scroll across those screens, more often than not, I remember her differently. Every time I close my eyes, I see all of the tubes. When it's quiet, I hear all of the machines that were keeping her alive. You see, my husband and I had to sit for 86 hours in the ICU while we were begging God, because, yes, we're Christians and we're conservative, we're from Arizona, we were begging God, we were pleading God, bargaining that she would just breathe. Over the last 32 months, Ashley did not celebrate her son's fifth, sixth, or seventh birthday. She did not watch her baby graduate from kindergarten. She did not celebrate Christmas or Thanksgiving, nor did we as a family. I'm sure you guys did. So she celebrated the last of her birthdays when she was 26. She will forever be 26. Before you decide how you feel about my family and about fentanyl, understand that fentanyl affects all walks of life. By the time my testimony is over, please know that one person will have died. Ashley had brown hair and the most beautiful eyes. Ashley, with one smile, would steal your heart. Ashley had a kind heart and a gentle soul. I understand that the mission of the Department of Homeland Security is to secure our Nation's air, land, and sea borders to prevent illegal activity while facilitating lawful travel and trade. In my humble opinion, Mr. Mayorkas' border policies is partially responsible for my daughter's death. His wide-open border policy allows massive quantities of poisonous fentanyl into our country. Arizona is the fentanyl superhighway into the United States. I personally feel Mr. Mayorkas is responsible for opening that border to allow more than 10 million illegal border crossings since February 2021, which supports most of the illegal fentanyl into this country. This weapon of mass destruction has killed over 100,000 Americans on our soil for 2 years in a row. Under Secretary Mayorkas' leadership, or lack thereof, fentanyl is an invasion. The weapon of mass destruction has caused unimaginable numbers of deaths, unmeasurable damage to our country's family, families, including my own. My family is broken. My heart is broken. He couldn't even be here to face me today. Whatever he's doing that is more important than facing me today, I don't know what that could be. Our country deserves a secure border. Our country deserves to feel safe. Our country deserves to be free of fentanyl. We need to close the fentanyl superhighway. We need to close the border. Thank you.  Prepared Statement of Josephine Dunn Before I begin, I wish to thank you for the gift of your time. I want to thank you for allowing me to share my beautiful daughter's story. As painful as this is for me to do, I wish to spare as many parents the unfathomable pain and debilitating grief I carry every single day. My daughter left this Earth 967 days ago. Today would have been her 29th birthday. In the next 5 minutes you will see many beautiful photos of Ashley. Photos are all my familiy and I have left of her. That is not true I guess we do have a small urn with some of her ashes and we do have our memories. In the same 5 minutes that I get to share her story, someone else's loved one in the United States will die from Fentanyl. Over the next 24 hours 190 loved ones will die. Today, in my State. The beautiful State of Arizona alone 5 people will lose their lives to this weapon of mass destruction. While you see her beautiful smile and almond shaped eyes scroll across the screen, more often than not I remember her differently. Every time I close my eyes. I see all of the tubes. When it is quiet, I hear all of the machines working to keep her alive. You see, my husband and I sat with her for 86 hours in the ICU. We were begging God for her to just come back to us. Pleading. Bargaining. Over the last 32 months, Ashley did not celebrate her beautiful son's 5th, 6th, or 7th birthday. She did not watch him graduate from Kindergarten. She did not celebrate the 4th of July's, Thanksgivings, Christmas', New Year's days. She did her birthdays because she will forever be 26 years old. The only reason for her absence is she died of Fentanyl poisoning on May 26, 2021. She spent over 30 minutes on the floor of her bathroom between the commode and the bathtub. She lay waiting for her ``friends'' to clean up her home before calling 9-1-1 requesting paramedics. The Good Samaritan Act did not save her. Her murderer, a convicted, repeat drug distribution offender, a 44- year-old career drug dealer/trafficker calculated the value of Ashley's life to equate to a mere $40. This dealer has 14 prior convictions for drug sales. ``Dawn the dealer'' even went so far as warning Ashley of the possibility of her death. These facts are clearly documented in Ashley's phone. That phone was surrendered to the honorable officers of PANT because a search warrant was issued. As Ashley laid in the ICU at YRMC in Prescott her father and I prayed at her bedside for her to just breathe. You see, Ashley never took another breath on her own. At her bedside, her father and I were faced with the unbearable decision to discontinue all mechanical life- saving measures after 86 grueling hours of begging and pleading she just survive this poisoning. That she just breathed. Instead one half of ONE PILL that contained 5 mg of Fentanyl killed her. Her dealer cannot be prosecuted for Ashley's death. Nor can she even be charged. Ashley's son, her father, and I are not even considered victims of ``Dawn the dealer's'' actions. We do not even have the ability to provide a victim impact statement in Ashley's trafficker's case. The evidence is clear in Ashley's phone. Toxicology report states 5mg of Fentanyl. Nothing can be done. She knowingly sold poison to our daughter which caused her death. Yet she will not be charged. Before you decide how you feel about this legislation and our fight to raise awareness about Fentanyl and drugs in general I wish to remind you no family is immune from being touched by Fentanyl. Fentanyl is poison. My fight to pursue and see drug dealers prosecuted, poison peddlers in prison, and the murders for quick money will only end when I take my last breath. I do not wish to bore you with statistics except for the following: In the United States, every 5 minutes of every day of the week, someone dies from overdose/poisoning. Yes, you read that correctly. That is something I never wanted to know. Please take a moment and thank God right now, if your family has not been touched or changed by addiction, or death because of addiction, or death from fentanyl/opioid poisoning. All street drugs are potentially laced with fentanyl these days. So by the time my testimony is over, someone will have died from an opioid overdose/poisoning. Maybe someone you know. Someone's child. Someone's mother. Someone's spouse. Someone's parents. Someone's friend. Someone's aunt/uncle. Let that sink in. Ashley Dunn was my ``someone''. She will not die in vain. Ashley had brown hair and beautiful almond-shaped eyes. Ashley, with one smile would steal your heart. Ashley had a kind heart and gentle soul. Ashley had a personality that would light up every room. She paid the ultimate price by losing her life because of ONE pill. Ashley was a daughter and a granddaughter. She was a sister and an aunt. She was a wife and a mother. She was a cousin. She was a friend and animal lover. She was an artist. She was a painter. So the paradigm needs to change. Public awareness needs to change. My hope is this email humbles you and your judgment of who might take one pill. The people dying from fentanyl are high-school students, first-time users, recreational users, and long-time addicts. These people come from all walks of life. Fentanyl doesn't discriminate. I will forever advocate for each and every person that dies from fentanyl overdose/poisoning because those people deserved every bit of space on this earth as we do. Every bit of love and peace and opportunity. Survival from overdose is possible but not for my Ashley. My Ashley has died. I understand that the Mission of Department of Homeland Security is to secure our Nation's air, land, sea, and borders to prevent illegal activity while facilitating lawful travel and trade. In my humble opinion, Mr. Mayorkas' border polices is partially responsible for my daughter's death. His wide-open border policy allows massive quantities of poisonous fentanyl into our country. Arizona is the fentanyl superhighway into the United States. I personally feel Mr. Mayorkas is responsible for opening the border to allow more than 10 million illegal border crossings since February 2021 which supply illegal Fentanyl. This weapon of mass destruction that has killed over 100,000 Americans on our soil for 2 years in a row. Under Secretary Mayorkas' leadership, Fentanyl is an invasion. This weapon of mass destruction, has caused unimaginable numbers of deaths and unmeasurable damage to our country's families. My family is broken. My heart is broken. I live in a border State. I believe that our border is not secure. I believe myself and the American people have been misled by Mr. Mayorkas. Our country deserves a secure border. Our country deserves a secure border. We need to close the Fentanyl superhighway. We need to close the border. Thank you.  Chairman Green. Thank you, Ms. Dunn. I now recognize Ms. Pearlstein for 5 minutes to summarize her opening statement. STATEMENT OF DEBORAH N. PEARLSTEIN, DIRECTOR, PRO- GRAM IN LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY AND CHARLES AND MARIE ROBERTSON VISITING PROFESSOR IN LAW AND PUB- LIC AFFAIRS, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY Ms. Pearlstein. Thank you very much, Chairman Green, Ranking Member Thompson, Members of the committee. Thank you for the invitation to participate in the committee's consideration of whether Constitutional grounds exist to impeach Department of Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas. Having been a professor of Constitutional law for more than a decade, a director of two different academic centers focused on the study of Constitutional democracy, I've studied, written, and taught about the unique role impeachment plays in our system of government. As a mother and a former human rights lawyer, I couldn't take the subject matter in front of the committee today more seriously. My expertise, however, is in the field of Constitutional law, not in immigration policy as such, and my testimony, solely in my personal capacity, is thus limited to questions of Constitutional authority that are relevant here. While my written statement goes into greater detail in these few minutes, I'd like to highlight just two points. First, impeachment is a narrow remedy for a specific kind of misconduct, limited by the Constitution to addressing offenses against our system of government that cannot be solved through ordinary channels of redress. Second, no branch of government has more power under our Constitution to address matters of border security than Congress. Although the Framers of the U.S. Constitution were convinced that impeachment would have to be retained from the British regime they had just overthrown as a remedy against the most egregious offenses of public officers, they were determined to limit the scope of the power to ensure it remained consistent with the new design of our Constitutional democracy. Central to our system is this principle of separation of powers. Each branch of government remains independent, with none empowered to fully control the members of the others. Because impeachment was a potentially dangerous exception to that overriding principle, the Framers significantly narrowed the scope of the impeachment power as it existed under the law of the king. Above all, the Framers significantly narrowed the grounds for which officials could be impeached. As now, treason and bribery were recognized as the most serious offenses against a system of government in which the American people were asked to entrust elected leaders with acting in their interest. Treason was a betrayal of the interests of the American people in favor of the interests of a foreign enemy. Bribery involved a public official placing his own interests in personal power and enrichment above the interests of the public. By labeling the other category other high crimes and misdemeanors, the Framers signaled that they meant to include only those offenses that posed a similarly severe threat, not to a particular area of public policy, but to the very system of government that depends on officials acting in good faith on behalf of the people who place them in office. Policy differences could be addressed through elections. Impeachment was to be, and largely has been, a last-ditch mechanism to address offenses against Constitutional democracy by a single individual that can't be adequately addressed through ordinary channels of government. Second point, the first and most important remedy the Constitution provides to address perceived failings of the President and the Executive branch remains the separation of powers, including Congress' authority to affect policy change itself. When it comes to immigration, in particular, the Supreme Court has long described Congressional power in the field as plenary. Article I of the Constitution grants Congress the power to set the terms and conditions by which a foreign national may become a U.S. citizen, sweeping authorities to provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States the power to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying out these duties. And Article I, section 9, gives Congress the exclusive power over how the U.S. Government allocates its resources. These vast powers, which the Constitution sets out in its very first article, remain among our democracy's most fundamental checks on the exercise of Executive power. Despite these vast reserves of Constitutional authority, a spike in partisan polarization in recent decades, a refusal to work across partisan lines to solve common problems, has meant the power to address pressing national problems has gone unused. Nowhere has this effect been more apparent than in Congress' failure to develop national policy on immigration. Despite all that has changed, the last significant piece of comprehensive immigration legislation to pass Congress with bipartisan support was in 1986. The action under consideration here, impeachment, isn't a tool of policy change, particularly the impeachment of a single Cabinet official who can be replaced by another official, given precisely the same role, will have no effect on the heartbreaking problems we have heard described. Without taking a position on the wisdom of any particular bill now under consideration, I understand that multiple pieces of bipartisan legislation are today pending in the House, very active negotiations under way in the Senate. The Framers of the Constitution well understood the acute difficulty of embracing compromise with their domestic political opponents. But for the purpose of actually addressing the needs and easing the pain of the people who live in this country, the Framers of the Constitution thought that no one in Government could do more to make a real difference than you. Thank you.  Prepared Statement of Deborah N. Pearlstein January 18, 2024 introduction Chairman Green, Ranking Member Thompson, Members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to participate in the committee's consideration of whether Constitutional grounds exist to impeach Alejandro Mayorkas, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Having been a professor of Constitutional law for more than a decade, and a director of two different academic centers focused on the study of Constitutional democracy, I have repeatedly had occasion to study, write, and teach about the unique role impeachment plays in our system of government. My expertise is in the field of Constitutional law, not in immigration policy as such, and my testimony is thus limited to questions of Constitutional authority as relevant here. This testimony is offered in my personal capacity and should not be understood to reflect the views of my university employer or of any other institution with which I am affiliated. In this testimony, I make three points. First, impeachment is a narrow remedy for specific kind of misconduct, limited by the Constitution to the most serious class of offenses against our Constitutional system of government: ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' U.S. Const., Art. II, sec. 4. The apparent allegations against Secretary Mayorkas described in various Committee Majority Reports I have reviewed do not appear to establish grounds for any of those offenses within the meaning of Article II. Second, impeachment is not and has never been an instrument capable of effecting policy change; impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas in particular can have no impact on the administration's exercise of immigration enforcement discretion, a power the Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized is vested by the Constitution in the Executive branch. Finally, no branch of Government has more power under our Constitution to address matters of border security than Congress. While that authority has gone largely untapped in recent decades, Congress remains the sole branch of Government Constitutionally-empowered to, for example, increase expenditures to bolster counter-fentanyl efforts at the border; accelerate the processing of foreign nationals seeking asylum; or define and establish criminal offenses against the United States. U.S. Const., Art. I, sec. 8. Although impeachment is likewise among the many powers afforded by the Constitution to Congress, there appears to be no Constitutional basis for pursuing it here. i. the impeachment power is specific and limited While the Framers of the U.S. Constitution were convinced that impeachment would have to be retained from the British regime they had just overthrown as a remedy against the most egregious offenses of public officers, they were determined to limit the scope of the power to ensure it remained consistent with the new design of our Constitutional democracy.\1\ Central to our system is the principle of separation of powers: each branch of government remains independent, with none empowered fully to control the members of the others. The Framers believed that it was through such interbranch competition for power, through ``mbition  made to counteract ambition,'' as Madison famously put it, that no one branch of government would be able to assert powers that threatened the democratic nature of government.\2\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ Multiple distinguished scholars and jurists have written influential volumes describing the impeachment power over the years; all reflect this basic historical understanding. See, e.g., MICHAEL J. GERHARDT, IMPEACHMENT: A GUIDE FOR THE ENGAGED CITIZEN (2024); CHARLES L. BLACK, JR. AND PHILIP BOBBIT, IMPEACHMENT: A HANDBOOK 26-28 (2d ed. 2018); LAURENCE TRIBE AND JOSHUA MATZ, TO END A PRESIDENCY: THE POWER OF IMPEACHMENT 39 (2018). \2\ THE FEDERALIST NO. 51, at 321-22 (James Madison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Because impeachment was a potentially dangerous exception to that overriding principle, the Framers thus significantly narrowed the scope of the impeachment power as it had existed under the law of the regime they had just overthrown.\3\ Under our Constitution, for example, the consequences of impeachment were limited to disqualification from office; no longer would it carry the other potentially harsh punishments that made it more of a penal sanction under the British King. Likewise, rather than requiring only a simple majority of each chamber of parliament to impeach as had the British, under the U.S. Constitution, no person could be convicted following impeachment without the consent of two-thirds of the Senate. U.S. Const., Art. I, sec. 3. Above all, the Framers significantly narrowed the grounds for which officials could be impeached to ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' U.S. Const., Art. II, sec. 4. Then, as now, treason and bribery were recognized as the most serious offenses against a system of government in which the American people were asked to entrust elected leaders with acting in their interest. Treason was a betrayal of the interests of the American people in favor of the interests of a foreign enemy. U.S. Const., Art. III, sec. 3. Bribery involved a public official placing his own interests in personal power or enrichment over the interests of the public.\4\ By labeling the residual category ``other high crimes and Misdemeanors,'' the Framers signaled they meant to include only those offenses that posed a similarly severe threat not to the accomplishment of particular political or policy agendas, but to the very system of government that depends on officials acting in good faith on behalf of the people who placed them in office.\5\ Policy differences could be addressed through elections. Impeachment was to be--and largely has been--a last-ditch mechanism to address offenses against Constitutional democracy that could not be adequately addressed through ordinary channels of Government. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \3\ See, e.g., GERHARDT, supra note 1. \4\ See, e.g., TRIBE AND MATZ, supra note 1, at 33. \5\ See, e.g., BLACK AND BOBBIT, supra note 1, at 33-35. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Although the incomplete records of the Constitutional Convention only occasionally shed much light on Constitutional meaning, here, those records are clear on what impeachment is not: ``maladministration,'' including malpractice, mismanagement, incompetence, or even unpopular policies. While Virginia delegate to the Convention George Mason had initially suggested limiting impeachable offenses to ``treason, bribery or maladministration,''\6\ Madison rejected the last term out of just the separation-of-powers concerns noted above. As Madison put it: ``So vague a term will be equivalent to tenure during the pleasure of the Senate.''\7\ It would effectively give Congress a degree of power over the Executive equivalent to that in the parliamentary system the Framers rejected-- tying the Executive to the policy preferences of the legislature, rather than maintaining it as the independent, co-equal branch the Framers envisioned. Mason soon agreed to delete ``maladministration'' in favor of ``other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' the language that remains today.\8\ The legislature should not be able to disable the Executive function, the Framers were convinced, solely because it objects to the administration's performance in office or disagrees with its policies--even if, and indeed especially when, the White House is controlled by one party and Congress another.\9\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \6\ 2 THE RECORDS OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION OF 1787, pp. 550-52 (Max Farrand, ed. 1911). \7\ Id. \8\ Id. \9\ See, e.g., Various Law Professors, Letter to Background and History of Impeachment: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on the Const. of the House Comm. on the Judiciary, 105th Cong. Rec. 230 (1998) (accessible at https://www.salon.com/1998/11/06/newsf_2/). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- To the extent it is possible to identify from the various impeachment resolutions and reports made public thus far by this committee's Majority, the Majority's allegations against Secretary Mayorkas relate to neither treason nor bribery, but to the suggestion that the Secretary has either been derelict in or neglectful of his duties, or that he has in some respect exceeded or abused his lawful authority.\10\ On the former claim, there have only been two occasions in U.S. history in which officials were impeached based on allegations related to the failure to carry out their official role: U.S. District Judge John Pickering in 1804, and U.S. District Judge Mark Delahay in 1873.\11\ In both of those cases, the charges alleged that the officials were either chronically inebriated or mentally incapacitated, or both. In short, neither involved a case in which Congress was simply dissatisfied with the official's performance in office; both involved officials who were at base physically or mentally unable to carry out their duties. No remotely comparable evidence of Secretary Mayorkas' incapacity has been presented here. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \10\ See, e.g., Committee on Homeland Security Majority Report, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas' Dereliction of Duty, July 19, 2023. \11\ See EMILY FIELD VAN TASSEL, WHY JUDGES RESIGN: INFLUENCES ON FEDERAL JUDICIAL SERVICE, 1789-1992, FEDERAL JUDICIAL CENTER (1993), available at https://www.fjc.gov/sites/default/files/2012/judgeres.pdf. Pickering was convicted in the Senate; Delahay resigned before his trial. Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The subject of the Majority's other set of allegations, related to the lawful authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security over immigration affairs, has been the subject of extensive litigation in the courts in recent years. As discussed in greater detail below, the courts have found Secretary Mayorkas to have acted within the scope of his Constitutional and statutory authority in cases that have categorically rejected many of the precise allegations on which Majority Reports and witnesses appear to rely on in support of their claims to the contrary here. To the extent any such disputes are still pending in the courts, they stand as evidence of why impeachment should be understood as a Constitutionally-unavailable remedy in this case. Far from a circumstance involving an exercise of power incapable of being addressed by ordinary channels of government in our Constitutional democracy, see supra, page 5, the grounds for impeachment here involve the same claims that have been, and in some cases still are, the subject of ordinary dispute resolution in the independent courts.\12\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \12\ See, e.g., M.A. v. Mayorkas, 2023 WL 5321924 (D.D.C. July 6, 2023). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ii. impeachment can have no impact on executive enforcement discretion There is only a single case in all of U.S. history in which a Federal official other than a judge or a President has been subject to impeachment. Secretary of War William Belknap was impeached almost 150 years ago for allegations that he received financial ``kickbacks'' from the operation of a trading post controlled by the U.S. military on Indian lands.\13\ The allegations against Secretary Belknap--charged with ``basely prostituting his high office to his lust for private gain''--manifestly had nothing to do with his efforts to implement the policies of the Presidential administration of which he was a part.\14\ Indeed, Belknap's case presented, in essence, the opposite situation than is presented here--in which Secretary Mayorkas is accused, at base, of carrying out immigration policies that have been embraced by the Presidential administration in which he serves and has been defended by it in court. In this case, even if Secretary Mayorkas is impeached and removed from office, the President retains the Constitutional authority simply to task the Secretary's successor with pursuing exactly the same set of policies. This reality is almost certainly a central reason why Congress has only once in the history of the United States believed it was worth legislators' time and taxpayers' substantial expense to pursue the impeachment of a Cabinet official notwithstanding the certainty that the official's removal will have no effect on administration policy.\15\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \13\ U.S. Senate, Impeachment Trial of Secretary of War William Belknap, 1876, available https://www.senate.gov/about/powers- procedures/impeachment/impeachment-belknap.htm. Belknap resigned shortly before he was impeached and was later acquitted of these charges in the Senate. Id. \14\ Trial of William W. Belknap, 4 CONG. REC. 2 (Apr. 4, 1876). Historians report that President Grant on learning of the scandal personally wrote Belknap's letter of resignation and referred the case to his Department of Justice for investigation. See JEAN EDWARD SMITH, GRANT 595 (2001); WILLIAM MCFEELY, GRANT: A BIOGRAPHY 433-44 (1981). \15\ There can be little question that impeachment proceedings drain legislative resources that might be devoted to other matters. For example, during one 3-year period, the House pursued 3 judicial impeachment proceedings that together involved 17 days of hearings; in 2 of those, the time from commencement of the investigation until approval of final articles of impeachment exceeded a year. Report of the National Commission on Judicial Discipline and Removal, 152 F.R.D. 265 (1993), available https://judicial-discipline-reform.org/ judicial_complaints/1993_Report_Removal.pdf; see Emily Field van Tassel, Why Judges Resign: Influences on Federal Judicial Service, 1789-1992, Federal Judicial Center (1993), available https:// www.fjc.gov/sites/default/files/2012/judgeres.pdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- To the extent the Majority Reports' allegations against the Secretary are related to those policies, in particular the suggestion that Secretary Mayorkas somehow exceeded the scope of his lawful authority to set priorities for the enforcement of U.S. immigration law, that claim has been rejected most recently by an overwhelming, bipartisan majority of the U.S. Supreme Court--for reasons that came as little surprise to experts in Constitutional law. Article II of the Constitution assigns the ``Executive Power'' to the President and provides that the President ``shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.'' U.S. Const., Art. II, secs. 1, 3. As the Court has made clear on multiple occasions, this power includes the authority to decide ``how to prioritize and how aggressively to pursue legal actions against defendants who violate the  law.''\16\ As the Court has equally made clear, most recently in an 8-1 ruling just last year, precisely the same principle applies with even greater force when it comes to the enforcement of immigration laws, a context in which ``the Executive's enforcement discretion implicates not only `normal domestic law enforcement priorities' but also `foreign-policy objectives.' ''\17\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \16\ TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S.__, (2021); see also United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 693 (1974) (``the Executive branch has exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide whether to prosecute a case''); Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 922-923 (1997) (Congress cannot Constitutionally transfer power to execute Federal law to State officials); United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996) (decisions about enforcement of ``the Nation's criminal laws'' lie within the ``special province of the Executive''). \17\ United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670 (2023) (quoting Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 490-491 (1999)). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- It was in the very same case, United States v. Texas, that the Court noted in rejecting a State challenge to Biden administration immigration enforcement policies, that the Department of Homeland Security was in key respects exercising discretion in this field in just the same way every past recent administration has during the decades-long period in which Congress has essentially absented itself from the task of immigration policy reform. As Justice Kavanaugh explained for the Court's majority: ``he Executive branch does not possess the resources necessary to arrest or remove all of the noncitizens covered by . That reality is not an anomaly--it is a constant. For the last 27 years since  were enacted in their current form, all five Presidential administrations have determined that resource constraints necessitated prioritization in making immigration arrests.''\18\ It is precisely that discretion Secretary Mayorkas has exercised during his tenure. Far from amounting to an ``abuse'' of his powers or ``neglect'' of his duties, he is carrying out those duties exactly as the Constitution, the Supreme Court, and every one of the past five administrations have contemplated he would. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \18\ United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670; see also Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 396 (2012) (``Federal officials, as an initial matter, must decide whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all''). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- iii. congress has sweeping constitutional power to remedy border security The first and most important remedy the Constitution provides to address perceived failings of the President and the Executive branch remains the separation of powers--including Congress' Constitutional authority to effect policy change itself. When it comes to immigration in particular, the Supreme Court has long described Congressional power in the field as ``plenary.''\19\ Article I of the Constitution grants Congress a range of both specific authorities--to regulate foreign commerce and to set the terms and conditions by which a foreign national may become a U.S. citizen--and sweeping authorities to ``provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States,'' and to ``make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper'' for carrying out its duties. U.S. Const., Art. I, sec. 8. And Congress of course may enact legislation delegating some of its own authority to the Executive, tasking it with carrying out statutory duties as interpreted by the courts. Of at least as much significance is the Constitution's parallel requirement in the Article I, Section 9 Appropriations Clause, providing: ``No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.'' As reflected in these and other express provisions of the Constitution, Congress' ``power of the purse'' is exclusive and is among our democracy's most fundamental checks on the exercise of Executive power.\20\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \19\ See, e.g., Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753, 766 (1972) (sustaining Congress's `plenary power to make rules for the admission of aliens and to exclude those who possess those characteristics which Congress has forbidden'). \20\ See, e.g., THE FEDERALIST NO. 58, at 297-98 (James Madison) (Ian Shapiro ed., 2009) (describing Congress' power of the purse ``the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure''). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Despite these vast reserves of Constitutional authority, Congress has at times allowed its own powers to address pressing National problems to go unused, particularly as it has become increasingly hamstrung by partisan polarization.\21\ As an important task force of the American Political Science Association began documenting a decade ago, nowhere has this effect been more apparent than in Congress' failure to develop National policy on immigration.\22\ Informed by the findings of the bipartisan Commission on Immigration Reform, and introduced by bipartisan members of both chambers, the last significant piece of comprehensive immigration legislation passed Congress in 1986. Since then, Congress has established just one other bipartisan commission of experts on immigration to examine the problems independently, and based on research and analysis, develop recommendations for reform.\23\ While there have been multiple efforts to enact immigration reform legislation since then, including significant bills in 2005, 2006, 2010, and 2013 that garnered bipartisan sponsorship, these bills ultimately foundered in the face of objections from non-moderates in either the House or Senate chamber.\24\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \21\ See, e.g., NOLAN MCCARTY, POLARIZATION (2019). \22\ Michael Barber and Nolan McCarty, Causes and Consequences of Polarization, in NEGOTIATING AGREEMENT IN POLITICS: TASK FORCE REPORT OF THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION 39 (Mansbridge & Martin, eds. 2013) (citing The Immigration Reform and Control Act, Pub. L. No. 99-603 (1986)). \23\ The Jordan Commission was established in 1990 and concluded its work by 1997. Commission on Legal Immigration Reform, P.L. 101- 649,104 Stat. 5001, November 29, 1990. \24\ See id., at 39-40; see also Carmines & Folwer, The Temptation of Executive Authority, 24 IND. J. GLOBAL LEGAL STUD. 369 (2017) (describing various legislative initiatives). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Without taking a position on the wisdom of any particular policy initiative now under consideration, it is apparent that multiple pieces of legislation with bipartisan sponsorship are today pending in the House,\25\ and multiple press reports indicate that very active negotiations seeking bipartisan agreement on border security matters are likewise now under way in the Senate.\26\ While use of the impeachment power here will, for the reasons noted above, address none of the serious policy concerns the Majority Reports raise, use of the legislative power to enact relevant reforms might. The Framers of the Constitution well understood the acute difficulty of embracing compromise with their domestic political opponents. But for the purpose of actually addressing the needs and concerns of the American people, this process remains the most powerful tool the Constitution provides. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \25\ See, e.g., H.R. 5856--The Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act of 2023 (introduced Sept. 29, 2023). \26\ See, e.g., Julia Ainsley, et al., ``Negotiators Consider Expanding Expedited Deportations as Border Talks Near `Finish Line,' '' NBCNEWS, Jan. 13, 2024, available https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/ immigration/negotiators-consider-expanding-expedited-deportations- border-talks-fin-rcna133571. Chairman Green. Thank you, Ms. Pearlstein. Members will be recognized by order of seniority for their 5 minutes of questioning. An additional round of questioning may be called after all Members have been recognized. I now recognize myself for 5 minutes of questioning. Ms. Pearlstein, in 2019, on a New York public radio podcast, you were asked what you took away from a Congressional hearing on impeachment standards. Your response was as follows:  Chairman Green. Do you still stand by those words? Just a yes or no. Quick question. Ms. Pearlstein. It is absolutely the case. The Congress doesn't have to show a violation of---- Chairman Green. OK. Ms. Pearlstein . Title 18 of the U.S. Code. It has to show that there was a high crime or misdemeanor. Chairman Green. Reclaiming my time. I think the words that are very interesting to me is ``serious offenses against the public trust.'' Ms. Nobles, Ms. Dunn, do you think that our open border policies, which have allowed fentanyl to pour into this country, 1.8 million gotaways, unknown gotaways, is an offense against the public trust of this country? Ms. Nobles. Yes, definitely. Chairman Green. Ms. Dunn. Mrs. Dunn. Yes. Chairman Green. Ms. Nobles, the committee has been focused--well, first, before I ask your question, one of the things that was very interesting in your opening statement, Ms. Pearlstein, was about the power of--the separation of powers. You talk about Congress having the remedy to make laws to fix the immigration issue and the border issue. But see, we passed a law that says shall detain. Mr. Mayorkas has basically completely reversed that. So you are right. We could pass more laws. In fact, we tried. We passed H.R. 2, but it won't pass the Senate because they refuse to take it up. But, yes, we have the power to pass more laws. They are not even following the laws that are already written. That, from my standpoint, is basically a refusal to understand the separation of powers, that we write the laws and they enforce them. But the Secretary doesn't seem to care about that nor does he seem to care about the four court orders which have told him he is doing that and said cease and desist with these policies that are absolutely subverting the law. He refused to follow those court orders. Ms. Nobles, the committee has been focused on the Biden administration's refusal to secure our Southwest Border and vet alien arrivals. A report from the House Judiciary Committee pointed out multiple vetting failures with your daughter's killer. Its report shows that your daughter's murderer was arrested for association with the MS-13 well before he came to the United States, something the United States officials verified easily after the murder occurred. The report also noted that the alien was released after he was arrested for murder. Do you think that Secretary Mayorkas has done an adequate job of vetting illegal aliens coming across our Southern Border? Ms. Nobles. No. May I say that it took the local detectives to find out that he was an MS-13 gang member. Homeland Security and Department of Health and Human Services did not know that until after he killed my daughter. Then they try to write it in there after the fact, but it was already let out that they failed to know that he was an MS-13 gang member. Chairman Green. Ms. Dunn, do you believe Secretary Mayorkas genuinely cares about the well-being and safety of U.S. citizens like your daughter, considering that his actions are directly responsible for aggravating and fueling the on-going fentanyl crisis? Mrs. Dunn. Absolutely not. Chairman Green. Thank you. I yield. I now recognize the Ranking Member for his 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Thompson. Thank you very much. Let me say from the outset, every opportunity to provide resources for the Department of Homeland Security, Democrats on this committee have always given them what they have asked. The majority of Republicans on this committee, they have not given them resources. So when we interview people in the Department, the No. 1 issue that comes up is we need more resources, technology, sometimes manpower, sometimes just the ability to interdict. That is what we try to provide on a regular basis. I encourage my colleagues that when the next opportunity comes to fund the Department, let's listen to the men and women who work in the Department who say they need the resources, and let's give it to them. Professor Pearlstein, last week you joined two dozen of the country's most knowledgeable Constitutional lawyers on a bipartisan letter to Speaker Johnson and Chairman Green explaining that the Republican case against Secretary Mayorkas is unjustified as a matter of Constitutional law. Can you explain in simple terms why you and your colleagues concluded that impeaching the Secretary is unjustified under the Constitution? Ms. Pearlstein. Thank you, Mr. Ranking Member. Yes. The term ``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' which is what's at issue here, is a limited term of art. It includes only those offenses against the system of government, not ordinary crimes, offenses against the structure of Government comparable to treason and bribery, offenses that interfere in the way the Government works. The allegations that have been set forth here, which are very serious, are profound complaints about the policies that the current Secretary has pursued. They're policies that the Secretary has pursued under the current President of the United States, who appointed the Secretary and was elected to pursue those policies. Policy differences, and I agree with my colleague at the last hearing, no matter how profound are exactly not what impeachment was meant to be for. The Framers were very worried that impeachment would become something like a tool of the parliamentary system so that Congress could, in essence, hold the President and the President's administration on a leash. The Framers wanted each branch to remain independent to make their own policy judgments so that their ambition could counteract ambition, and they would fight each other on democratic terms over what the right answer was. Mr. Thompson. Thank you very much. I also want to talk to you about how Republicans and Democrats on this committee can work together to strengthen border security and address the opioid crisis. Democrats agree about the need for action to help families like those on our panel today and prevent further tragedies. Professor, in your testimony, you say, ``The first and most important remedy the Constitution will provide to address perceived failings of the President and Executive branch remains the separation of powers, including Congress' Constitutional authority to effect policy change itself.'' In other words, if the Congress doesn't like what an administration is doing, the Constitution gives its power to pass laws to direct a different course of action. Can you explain the power Congress has under the Constitution to effect change? Ms. Pearlstein. Thank you. Congress has the most power of any branch in the Government to affect change. It has, under Article I, the exclusive power to spend any money and allocate resources on behalf of the United States. It also has the other powers that I listed in my opening remarks. Critically, while it does have the power to pass laws, sweeping laws, and has, it is also subject to the rule of the Supreme Court, which has, in the allegations at issue here, twice rejected the arguments that were noted by the Chairman moments ago, that, in fact, there was a violation of law here. Those laws remain on the books, and Congress can do additional things, principally through funding, but not exclusively, to make them even stronger. Mr. Thompson. Thank you. I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs--House Committee on Foreign Affairs, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. McCaul, for 5 minutes. Mr. McCaul. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for holding this powerful hearing. I was a Federal prosecutor. I was deputy attorney general for the State of Texas for criminal justice. I worked with the victims of crime. That is what we do. We talk a lot about facts and figures, about the border, you know, statistics. But your stories are the most powerful because they are real-life stories about the impact of this man's violation of the public trust. I agree with your podcast that it doesn't have to be a Federal statute because they didn't have a lot of Federal statutes from the Founding Fathers who were at the Constitutional Convention. In fact, the Supreme Court recently held that impeachment is a tool Congress can use to hold this Secretary accountable. It is the legal justification. I believe he has violated his oath. He has violated the public trust. He has violated your daughters. I intend to personally uphold my oath to my country that I took in office. It has been a dereliction of duty of the grossest proportions I have seen in my 25 years of dealing with this border. Ms. Dunn, I could agree that fentanyl is a weapon of mass destruction. I passed a bill out of my committee defining it as such. It comes from China and they make it in Mexico. They kill our children here, 200,000 more than Vietnam, World War II. My children have been to 6 funerals now. I have seen it personally the destruction it does every 5 minutes. It is a fentanyl superhighway, and this border policy is personally responsible for it. He took an oath to defend and protect the Constitution and the American people, air, land, and sea, from enemies foreign and domestic. Ms. Dunn, do you believe he violated that oath? Mrs. Dunn. Yes, sir. I flew from Arizona to meet him and face him and ask him why, and he's not here today. I did not know that until after I landed yesterday. Mr. McCaul. He doesn't have the decency---- Mrs. Dunn. No. Mr. McCaul . To even show up---- Mrs. Dunn. That is correct. Mr. McCaul . And talk to you personally. Mrs. Dunn. Today is my daughter's birthday. I would have much rather been home with my poor husband grieving her. I didn't need to be here today. So whatever he's doing, I hope it's more important than that. Mr. McCaul. Well, let me say I'm sorry. Mrs. Dunn. Thank you. Mr. McCaul. Because apparently the Secretary doesn't care to show up and say that to you. Do you know he is meeting with Mexican officials today? Mrs. Dunn. Exactly. Mr. McCaul. How does that make you feel? Mrs. Dunn. Oh, you have no idea how I feel. Mr. McCaul. I will be meeting with Mexican officials later next week, and I am going to have a different story for them. I am going to have your story that I will take to them. Ms. Nobles, God, you know, these gangbangers come in and they join trafficking organizations. They are being sent to families that don't exist because it is a trafficking organization in the United States. This one man who deserves impeachment has created a criminal enterprise in the United States of America. Eight million encounters. What are we going to do with all these millions of people with no legal status who can't get a real job? So what do they do? It is drugs, gangbanging, murder. Now, I have seen it in my career, and they are the worst. It sickens me what happened to your daughter. You must relive it in your head every single day what she went through, what your poor daughter had to experience that day. Do you hold Mr. Mayorkas personally accountable for the death of your daughter? Ms. Nobles. Yes, I do. Mr. McCaul. I do, too. That is why he needs to be impeached. Do you hold him personally accountable for what he did? Do you hold him personally accountable for the policies he established which violated the public trust and ended up in the death of your daughter? Ms. Nobles. Yes. Mr. McCaul. Yet he doesn't have the decency or the guts to show up to you today and say, I am sorry, did he? Ms. Nobles. No, he did not. I mean, she was killed 3 days after her 20th birthday. She spent 3 days being 20. I sent her a message on her birthday, on July 24, that I was proud of the woman that she was becoming and that I love her. I didn't know that would be my last message of telling her that I love her. She even bought herself--I even gave her the money to buy her a JoJo Siwa cake because that is who she loved. She had autism and she loved JoJo, and her life was brutally taken. She had no idea what to expect that day when she went to bed after getting off the night shift of work and went to sleep in her own bed and had no idea what was going to happen on July 27. Mr. McCaul. Let me just close by saying I have a daughter that is your daughter's age. She has a cat named Snickers. I know your daughter had a cat named Oreo. This is the personal side of this chaos created by this man. This is a personal life story of the cause-and-effect that has happened because of these failed policies on the border. It is destruction and it is death and it has to stop. With that, I yield. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize the gentlelady from Texas, Ms. Jackson Lee, for her 5 minutes of questioning. Ms. Jackson Lee. As a mother, I would like to begin by offering my sincere condolences to Ms. Dunn and Ms. Nobles for the devastating losses that they and their families have experienced. No amount of sympathy and thank yous can compensate for the loss. No one should ever have to experience the loss of a child. So please know that we are committed to making our communities safer and combating the heinousness of drug trafficking and other violence that comes from those that should not be in this country and should not take advantage of the innocent people who are here, which includes your children. Mr. Chairman, the stories of Ms. Dunn and Ms. Nobles are gut-wrenching. They are clearly for any of us, we cannot stand in their shoes, no matter how much we try to empathize, try to seem like we are standing in their shoes, try to use language that would create hysteria, to seem like we have the same pain. Nobody, no one can express the pain that a parent that has lost a child can feel. It is gut-wrenching. But you brought them here, unfortunately, where our solutions may not be the solutions that they seek under the false pretense that impeaching Secretary Mayorkas would in any way prevent what happened to their children from happening to someone else's. It wouldn't and I think you know that. What is worse is that the Republicans on this committee are not leveling with Americans about the actions that they have taken or not taken to secure the border and combat drug trafficking. The truth is, at every opportunity, Republicans at the Federal and State level have pursued policies--politics over policy and obstructed efforts to improve conditions at the border. We need more resources and we need more skilled personnel. We need more ways to keep bad guys out of here to ensure the protection of the innocent, precious children of these two mothers. In Washington, all but 9 of my Republican colleagues voted against the fiscal year 2023 omnibus, which provided much- needed increases on Custom and Border Protection funding to increase personnel along the border and improve fentanyl detection. Republicans have refused to act on the President's supplement request, sitting right here waiting for us to act, which would provide additional resources not only for CBP, but also for communities receiving migrants. Instead of considering politics, policies to improve security along the border or prevent drug trafficking and treat fentanyl addiction, we are willing--are sitting here today at a futile impeachment proceeding. We need to give hope to these parents. We need to give love that shows action. So let me quickly ask Professor Pearlstein, Republicans have argued that the Secretaries should be impeached for failing to secure the border, yet most of them have voted against funding for border security that the administration requested. If Republicans really wanted to secure the border, is it more effective to provide the funding that the administration has requested or to impeach the Secretary? Let me add this question as well, if you can incorporate both of these. As I noted, the Governor of Texas has blocked Border Patrol from entering areas along the U.S.-Mexico border. If Republicans really wanted Border Patrol to improve enforcement along the Southwest Border, does it make sense to exclude Border Patrol from areas surrounding the border? In fact, we lost a mother and two children just recently. Do you believe a State can do that under the Constitution? Thank you, Doctor. This question is for you. Ms. Pearlstein. Thank you, Representative Jackson Lee. I can't speak to policy effectiveness. It is certainly within Congress' power today, in the Republican side as well as the Democratic side, to vote appropriations that would actually support programs for fentanyl addiction and programs that would support families who've lost loved ones to any of these. I can't speak to the details of what's happening on the border today, but the general rule of the Constitution is Federal law under the Constitution is the supreme law of the land. State efforts to interfere with Federal efforts to enforce border laws are unconstitutional. Ms. Jackson Lee. Let me just quickly say, Mr. Chairman, this impeachment proceeding is not going where we want it to go. We want to help these parents. We want to cry out for them, but we want to give them solutions. We want to focus on a border security mission with the resources that Congress has afforded the Department and within the confines of the law. My Republican colleagues would rather deprive DHS of the reasonableness and resources it needs to carry out its border security mission so that it can attack the Secretary, who himself, I have seen, show great remorse for the losses of individuals. Impeaching him, is that the answer to saving our children? I would hope that we would come together, stand together to be outraged over the loss of anyone's precious, precious child and stand united as the American people to fight against this dastardly act of drugs and viciousness at the border and make our borders safe for Americans and as well as those who come to this country for the right reasons. All of them are our neighbors who live in the southern part of the United States. They are our neighbors, and we should try to find a way, but we should not ignore the pain of these parents. We can do both. We do not have to make a mockery of impeachment. We can work with the Department of Homeland Security and our Secretary of Homeland Security and this President who cares. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield. Chairman Green. The gentlelady yields. I now recognize Mr. Higgins for his 5 minutes of questions. Mr. Higgins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, our Southern Border, under the control of Secretary Mayorkas, is 1,954 miles of failure. Ten million illegal crossings in 3 years, the disintegration of American sovereignty, total loss of American law and order, exponential enhancement of cartel human trafficking operations and cartel narcotics trafficking, millions of American families crushed by financial loss, and the unspeakable grief of unprecedented loss of American lives to drugs and violent crime. This is the legacy of Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. As God is my witness, we will impeach that man in this committee. We will hold him accountable for his colossal failure. We will take no pleasure in doing so, because it closes the chapter of a disastrous era of American history. We have largely lost our country down there. This body should be discussing sending massive military aid to Texas, not to Ukraine. Ms. Nobles, Mrs. Dunn, I lost a daughter long ago. It is a club nobody wants to join. I listened. It was difficult to listen to your testimony. I read your submitted testimony. The message that I received is that your daughters are perfected, and they are very, very proud of you both. I promise you, we will hold Secretary Mayorkas accountable and further the administration that he serves. Ms. Nobles, I am going to ask you to reflect upon a particular policy that the Biden administration and Secretary Mayorkas pursues. The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services have systems in place to ``ensure'' that unaccompanied alien children from noncontiguous countries are transferred from Customs and Border Protection to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, ORR. But the House Judiciary report regarding your daughter's murder notes that the Office of Refugee Resettlement, ORR, had lost track of more than 85,000 children and placed fewer than 15,000 follow- up calls, calls, not personal visits, after discharging an additional 32,000 children. Now, at no point did anyone under Secretary Mayorkas' command flag the violent criminal that murdered your daughter. Ms. Nobles. No. Mr. Higgins. Had a criminal gang history, along with multiple MS-13 tattoos. What would your daughter say about a Secretary of Department of Homeland Security who facilitates a system that has lost over 100,000 children, mostly young teenage girls? Mrs. Nobles. Ms. Nobles. Sorry, what was your question? Mr. Higgins. What would your daughter say about over 100,000 lost teenage children of God? A system run like that. Ms. Nobles. She would be--I'm sure she'd be very upset. Mr. Higgins. Her heart would break for those children, would it not? Ms. Nobles. Yes. Mr. Higgins. Americans just like her require action, and that is what this committee will deliver. Mr. Chairman, my time has expired. Mr. LaLota . The gentlemen's time has expired. The gentleman from California, Mr. Correa, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Correa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, let me thank our witnesses for being here today. Ms. Dunn, Ms. Nobles, I am also a father, like many of us here, represent an area a lot of hardworking Americans surviving day to day. When my four kids were growing up we invested a lot of time and effort. Little League, Little League Basketball, keeping them away from that bad stuff. I remember a story, my fellow father, another father in Little League, his kid was a gifted athlete. He was going to be the next major league player. His dad was there every day, pitching to him bucket after bucket of baseballs. Then one day, they stopped showing up. Later on, I found out that that young man and his dad started going to drug rehab. That son had come under the spell of hard drugs, and I have never seen them again. Stories like yours, I wish I could say, were not--were uncommon in my district. But I have heard them way too many times. Each one that I hear, your story, is of pain and suffering. In my district, we live through heroin addicts, the cocaine surge, crack, PCP, and now fentanyl, the worst of all. This is the reason why all of us here at the Federal level, Democrats, Republicans, on both houses, with the President, have to stop bickering, have to stop fighting, come together to protect middle America in this country. Ma'am, when it comes to fentanyl, you said Arizona, 50 percent. I will tell you, I have been to the border. I have talked to our CBP officers. They tell me 65 percent of all the fentanyl crosses through the San Ysidro port of entry. Just one port. It goes north through my county, and that is why we have so many problems in our area. You have one set of numbers, CBP has another set of numbers, but it is a challenge that we have to address. CBP, in 2019, we had seizure of 2,800 pounds; 2019, we had over 27,000 pounds that CBP has seized, 800 percent increase. But based on those border officers, this is about 10 percent of what is coming through. They say about 10 percent, 90 percent probably still gets through. I have asked those border officers, what do you need to do your job better? You know what they have told me? We need more resources. We need more personnel. When those officers tell me I am working 16-hour shifts, we need more personnel, we have to respond with more resources. It is not Lou. It is the men and women at the border telling us what they need. So, Professor Pearlstein, their dereliction of duty is not an impeachable offense. Correct? Correct? Ms. Pearlstein.  Mr. Correa. The amount of seizures at the border, I would say, shows that somebody is doing their job there. It is just a lot. What is better for us to do? Fight over an impeachment or respond to President Biden's ask for additional resources at the border, in your opinion? Ms. Pearlstein. Impeachment will have no impact on resources available to the border. It will have no impact on the policies pursued by this administration at all. Funding change, the appropriation of money for additional officers, for example, to improve fentanyl seizure operations, based on what you've described, certainly might have any effect and indeed may be a good effect. Impeachment has none. Mr. Correa. I will just ask my colleagues here today, let's get it together. Surge resources to the border. Make sure we stop fentanyl from crossing into our country. Every day that we debate over funding levels is another day that more Americans die from fentanyl. Mr. Chairman, thank you, and I yield. Mr. LaLota. The gentleman yields. The gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Guest, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Guest. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to rebut a little bit the argument that has been made by my colleagues on the other side, that Republicans aren't willing to secure resources for the border. I will just tell you that that is a complete, absolute misstatement of fact. In September, the House of Representatives passed an appropriations package for the Department of Homeland Security that appropriated an additional $2 billion. Those funds would go to hire additional agents. Those funds would go to merit pay. Those funds would go to invest in additional technology to stop the flow of fentanyl coming into this country. We also passed H.R. 2, which would have done the exact same thing. So for my colleagues on the other aisle to say we should be more focused on funding DHS than what we are doing here today, I would argue that we have done that. We passed our appropriations bill. We sent it to the Senate and Chuck Schumer has let that bill sit there gathering dust, refusing to bring either H.R. 2 or the House appropriations bill to the Senate for a vote. So for them to say that is a complete and utter misstatement of the facts. Professor Pearlstein, I do agree with you in your statement where you said that we do not have to have a violation of the Federal Criminal Code for impeachment and agree with you when you say serious offenses against public trust would arise to the level of impeachment. Prior to being elected to Congress, I served as a prosecutor in my local community, tried many jury trials. I remember, often hearing the judges tell potential jurors that reasonable, good-minded people can reach different conclusions when applying facts to the law. The law in this case, I believe, is the Constitution, the impeachment clause, that we, as reasonable Members of Congress, must apply the facts. The facts as I view them, and they may be different than viewed by other Members of Congress, everyone views those using their own perspective, I believe that there is ample evidence. I believe that Secretary Mayorkas violated his oath to protect and defend the Constitution. I believe that Secretary Mayorkas has willfully failed to enforce the law, particularly the INA, where it says repeatedly that the Secretary shall detain and remove immigrants. I believe that Secretary Mayorkas has lied to Congress when he has repeatedly come in and said that the border is secure. I will tell you an example. Just last year, in April of last year, as Secretary Mayorkas came and he sat there where you were sitting, Ms. Dunn, I had the opportunity to ask him, are all 9 sectors of the Southwest Border secure? His answer was yes. Now, his answer contradicted the answer given just 3 weeks prior by his chief of Border Patrol, Chief Ortiz, when Chief Ortiz said, 5 of the 9 sectors on our Southwest Border are not secure. So I believe he has violated his oath to protect and defend the Constitution. I believe that he has willfully failed to enforce a law, and I believe that he has lied to Congress. Now, Professor, I see in your statement that you provided, you say that really only on two occasions, back in 1904--excuse me, 1804 and 1872, where you had the removal of two U.S. district judges, where they were removed, one because one was chronically inebriated and the other was mentally incapacitated, and you said that they were unable to carry out their duties because of that. I believe that a person who willfully chooses not to carry out their duties is more impeachable than someone who has some sort of mental inability to do so. I believe that the record is clear if you look at what this committee has done to show that Secretary Mayorkas has refused to carry those duties out. Now, I want to ask you, because you clearly say in your report, Professor, that you have given, that Congress--that there appears to be no Constitutional basis for pursuing this impeachment. My question is relating to a different impeachment matter. Did you feel that way last Congress for the two impeachments of President Trump? Did you feel that there was a Constitutional basis for the impeachment of Donald Trump, either his first or second impeachment? Ms. Pearlstein. I did. Mr. Guest. OK. So this matter differs in Secretary Mayorkas from both the first and second impeachment of the former President? Ms. Pearlstein. Yes. Mr. Guest. In what manner? Ms. Pearlstein. Several. First, although I've heard now several times the allegation here that Secretary Mayorkas was, in some respect, violating his legal responsibility. Those claims, the specific claims you've raised about detention, enforcement, power, were raised and litigated all the way up to the Supreme Court by the State of Texas twice. Mr. Guest. Ms. Pearlstein, let me ask, can reasonable people---- Ms. Pearlstein. And the Supreme Court ruled against---- Mr. Guest. Can reasonable people---- Ms. Pearlstein . That argument. Mr. Guest. Can reasonable people look at the facts and draw different conclusions? Ms. Pearlstein. Reasonable people can't draw different conclusions about the law as applied here. Mr. Guest. You have to apply the law to the facts. I understand. I don't believe that there is consensus---- Mr. LaLota. Excuse me. Mr. Guest . That your version of what you believe the law is, is actually not---- Mr. LaLota. The gentleman's time has expired. Mr. Guest. I yield back. Thank you. Mr. LaLota. The gentlewoman from Texas, Ms. Jackson Lee is recognized for the purpose of entering something into the record. Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will ask unanimous consent to submit into the record an article, ``Why America is struggling to stop the fentanyl epidemic,'' and an article that says how fentanyl crisis fourth wave has hit every corner of the United States. I ask unanimous consent to place those in the record. Mr. LaLota. Without objection, so ordered.  Article From Foreign Affairs why america is struggling to stop the fentanyl epidemic Last Updated: May 15, 2023 By: Vanda Felbab-Brown https://www.foreignaffairs.com/mexico/why-america- struggling-stop-fentanyl-epidemic The United States is suffering the deadliest drug epidemic in its history. Overdoses claimed the lives of more than 100,000 Americans between August 2021 and August 2022 alone. Over the span of just a few years, drug deaths have doubled. Most of these overdoses invo]ve fentanyl, which now kills around 200 Americans every day. To address the crisis, the U.S. Government is not only deploying law enforcement to crack down on fentanyl dealers but also taking steps to prevent and treat substance use and the harms it produces. But the continued growth of the fentanyl epidemic makes clear that these measures are not enough. Since all fentanyl used in the United States is produced abroad, stemming the flow of the drug into the country is essential as well. So far, such supply-side efforts have run aground. For one thing, synthetic opioids such as fentanyl can be produced from a wide array of chemicals, many of which also have legitimate commercial uses. That means restricting the supply of these chemicals is difficult and impractical. What is more, when regulators ban or restrict synthetic opioids or their ingredients, producers simply tweak their recipes. Less talked about, but just as consequential, are the geopolitical obstacles that make it so hard for the U.S. Government to plug the supply channels. Most of the world's fentanyl and its precursor chemicals come from China or Mexico, countries whose current policies and priorities make effective control of fentanyl production very difficult. U.S. law enforcement cooperation with China, which was limited to begin with, has in recent years collapsed altogether. Absent a reset in U.S.-Chinese relations, that is unlikely to change. The Mexican government, too, has eviscerated law enforcement cooperation with the United States. Although a series of high-level bilateral meetings in April may have opened a path to increased cooperation down the line, it is far from clear if they will lead to substantive action from Mexican authorities. But there is much more that the Biden administration can do. Washington still has unexplored options at its disposal to induce stronger cooperation from Chinese and Mexican authorities, for instance by combining constructive proposals with the threat of sanctions against State and private actors in those countries. It can also adopt additional intelligence and law enforcement measures of its own, with or without foreign cooperation. It is high time that Washington take action on this front. If it does not, the record death rates that fentanyl is causing today will be eclipsed by even higher ones tomorrow. Made in China U.S. officials have long understood that cutting off fentanyl production at its source means cutting it off in China. Since 2015, they have pushed Beijing to tighten controls on fentanyl-class drugs and to get serious about enforcing them. Initially, those efforts seemed to bear fruit. In 2019, China began to place restrictions on the entire class of synthetic opioids, and it has since extended those laws to the main precursor chemicals used in synthetic opioid production. For a while, the United States and China even worked together on drug busts. In 2019, Chinese authorities in Hebei Province used U.S. intelligence to arrest and convict 9 traffickers for mailing fentanyl straight to consumers and dealers in the United States. Since then, however, Chinese traffickers have evaded controls by rerouting their operations through Mexico. Unlike drugs such as methamphetamine, which remain firmly in the hands of Chinese organized crime syndicates, the production chain for fentanyl often starts with small and middle-level players in the country's chemical and pharmaceutical industries, including the odd mom-and-pop outfit. These seemingly legitimate businesses ship fentanyl precursors to Chinese or Mexican drug cartels. The cartels synthesize the chemicals into finished fentanyl and then move it onto the U.S. market. It is hard for outsiders to get a clear view of the current state of China's domestic drug enforcement. But there have been no high- profile Chinese prosecutions since the 2019 trial in Hebei; neither does Beijing appear to be doing anything to stem the flow of precursor chemicals to Mexican cartels. This inaction is no accident. The arrests in Hebei took place when Beijing still hoped for a broader thaw in relations with Washington. As that hope has eroded, so has China's willingness to coordinate with U.S. authorities on the opioid front. Put simply, Beijing thinks of counternarcotics collaboration as downstream from its geostrategic relations. Unlike the U.S. Government, which seeks to delink the issue from geopolitics, China views the fentanyl crisis through the lens of its growing rivalry with the United States. It did so even before last year's visit by then U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, after which China formally ended all law enforcement cooperation with the United States. U.S. punitive measures against China, such as sanctions and indictments, are unlikely to change this. Even in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, where Beijing takes drug trafficking very seriously, its engagement with foreign authorities tends to be highly selective, self-serving, and subordinated to its geopolitical interests. At home and abroad, the Chinese government rarely takes action against the top echelons of crime syndicates unless they infringe on a narrow set of core state interests. These criminal groups provide a variety of services to legal businesses, including to firms with ties to government officials and the Chinese Communist Party. Efforts to better regulate precursor chemicals and fentanyl analogs are also hampered by systemic corruption and the incentive structures within which Chinese officials operate. Taken together, these conditions leave plenty of room for Chinese criminal networks to expand their scope and reach, including in the Americas. There are signs that Chinese fishing vessels in Latin American waters sometimes carry drugs and precursor chemicals. What is clear is that Chinese actors play a significant role in laundering money for Mexican cartels through informal financial and trade networks. Of particular note is the rise of payment in kind: in exchange for drug precursors, Mexican cartels provide Chinese traffickers with coveted black-market products, especially timber and protected wildlife. The potential damage to economic sustainability, food security, and global biodiversity is severe--not to mention the potential for the global spread of zoonotic diseases. Stuck in the Fifties Although relations with Mexico have not deteriorated to the same degree, U.S. drug policy there faces serious obstacles as well. The collapse of the rule of law in Mexico goes far beyond the human toll of its drug war, which has killed more than 30,000 Mexicans every year since 2017--not counting the more than 112,000 people that went missing during the same period. In addition to controlling the drug trade, the cartels have expanded their extortion rackets and have even come to dominate parts of the country's formal economy. They now have a hand in agriculture, fisheries, logging, mining, and the water supply. Their assault on state power and civil society has taken on new, more brazen forms, too, including increasingly aggressive attempts to influence elections and infiltrate state institutions. Upon taking office in 2018, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged that he would address the spiraling crisis with ``hugs, not bullets.'' By this, he meant social and economic measures to better address the structural forces driving many young people into the hands of the cartels. But besides creating a new National Guard--the latest in a long series of haphazard institutional reshuffles in the Mexican security forces--Lopez Obrador has never articulated any clear vision of how to stabilize the situation in the shorter term. The Mexican government's hope, it seems, is that if it lets the cartels duke it out among themselves, they will eventually reach a balance of forces and the violence will subside. But the conflict that is causing much of the bloodshed--a brutal war for primacy between the Sinaloa Cartel and its main rival, the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion--has not abated. If anything, it has intensified and spread to other parts of Latin America, even as far as Chile. To make matters worse, Mexico has systematically hollowed out cooperation with U.S. law enforcement. Lopez Obrador blames U.S. pressure on the cartels for fanning the violence, and his 1950's vision of politics and foreign affairs revolves around limiting any noneconomic U.S. presence in his country. In 2020, when the United States arrested Salvador Cienfuegos, Mexico's former secretary of defense, for colluding with a vicious drug cartel, Lopez Obrador threatened to expel all U.S. law enforcement personnel and end all cooperation with U.S. authorities. Washington bent backward to assuage him, handing Cienfuegos back to Mexico, where he was promptly acquitted. But the Mexican government has since passed a national- security law that further hobbles cooperation with U.S. agents. In March, Lopez Obrador started claiming that no fentanyl is cooked in Mexico, a falsehood roundly debunked not just by the U.S. Justice Department but also by parts of his own government. In recent weeks, he once again threatened to expel U.S. agents from Mexico. With the Mexican government also threatening to withdraw from the Merida Initiative, a bilateral framework for security cooperation that had been in place since December 2008, the U.S. Government worked hard to negotiate a successor agreement. Mexican officials, however, have interpreted the new framework very narrowly: the United States should reduce domestic drug demand, arrest more Mexican fugitives on U.S. soil, and keep weapons and illicit money from flowing south into Mexico, while Mexico does what it wants on its side of the border without letting the United States in on it. The Mexican government has offered only limited and intermittent cooperation ever since. Whereas Mexican authorities have kept the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in a deep freeze on their territory, they have allowed for occasional intelligence sharing and have at times worked with the investigative branch of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Ultimately, however, the Mexican government is not taking on the criminal groups and their fentanyl trade. Instead, as a recent Reuters investigation revealed, it is cooking its reports about fentanyl lab busts to placate Washington. In any case, the Trump administration taught Mexico a valuable, albeit unfortunate, lesson: the United States will give up on a wide range of interests as long as Mexico suppresses migration flows to the U.S. border. The Biden administration has not reversed that lesson. Closing The Doors At present, the odds of getting more cooperation from either China or Mexico in the fight against the fentanyl trade are slim. But Washington must keep on trying. When it comes to Beijing, U.S. diplomats should play to its desire to be a global counternarcotics leader in the eyes of the world. China likes to project an image of being tough on drugs. But it has come under fire from countries in Southeast Asia for the steady flow of Chinese methamphetamine precursors into the region, which has set off a devastating drug epidemic. The United States could team up with these countries, as well as with Australia and New Zealand, to pressure China in multilateral forums. Concerted calls on Beijing to take action against synthetic drugs, implement better monitoring systems even for dual-use nonscheduled chemicals, and set best practices for its chemical firms could finally induce China to act. Among the best practices the United States and others should push for are self-regulation systems to detect and police suspicious activities and ``know your customers'' policies. It should continue demanding that China take down websites that illegally sell synthetic opioids to Americans or to Mexican criminal groups. And it should encourage China to adopt more robust anti-money-laundering standards in its banking and financial systems and trading practices. Washington can underpin such requests with the threat of sanctions. Punitive measures could include cutting off noncompliant Chinese firms from the U.S. market and targeting prominent pharmaceutical and chemical industry officials. U.S. law enforcement, meanwhile, should indict as many Chinese traffickers and their companies as possible. In Mexico, too, U.S. policy can still make a difference, although not all current proposals are workable. U.S. politicians, such as South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, have recommended that the U.S. Government designate Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs) on top of their current designation as transnational criminal organizations. Doing so would open the door to more intelligence gathering and even to U.S. military strikes on fentanyl labs. But the number of realistic targets would be limited, and striking them would not hobble the cartels for long. Nor would the FTO designation add anything to the regime of sanctions and financial intelligence tools already in place. In fact, it would only complicate U.S. policies in Mexico. Instead, the United States could intensify border inspections, even at the risk of substantially slowing down the legal trade and causing serious problems for perishable Mexican agricultural exports. Ideally, U.S.-Mexico law enforcement cooperation would be robust enough to keep legal border crossings efficient and enable joint inspections far from the border. But if Mexico refuses to act as a reliable partner, the United States should intensify border inspections on its own initiative. The economic cost of the opioid epidemic--to leave aside its immeasurable human toll--is simply too enormous to countenance inaction. In 2020, estimates put that cost at nearly $1.5 trillion. In contrast, in 2019, U.S. goods and services trade with Mexico totaled only $677.3 billion, with imports from Mexico at $387.8 billion. As with China, Washington should develop packages of leverage to underwrite its demands, including indictment portfolios against Mexican officials and politicians who sabotage cooperation with the United States. Instead of shying away from holding to account criminal officials such as Cienfuegos, the former Mexican defense minister, the United States should be arresting more of them. Hit Them Where It Hurts At the same time, U.S. officials should rethink their own measures against criminal actors involved in the fentanyl business. Given the diversified economic portfolios of Mexican and Chinese criminal networks nowadays, more drug seizures simply will not do. Authorities need to take aim at the traffickers' entire business empires and try to cut off their revenue streams wholesale, whether that means going after poaching and wildlife trafficking, illegal fishing, or other illicit activities. That requires bringing on board a wide range of U.S. departments and agencies for a whole-of-government approach, starting with the U.S. intelligence agencies, the Department of State, the Department of Defense, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. By taking a better look at the various offshoots of the fentanyl trade--the wildlife trafficking, the illegal fishing, and so forth--the United States would also get a better picture of the linkages between organized crime and foreign governments, including China. Greater intelligence sharing within the U.S. Government would help, as would increasing the role of Fish and Wildlife special agents in joint anti-organized-crime task forces. Alongside this effort, wildlife trafficking should be designated as a predicate offense for wiretap authorizations, which would empower authorities to start gathering intelligence without having to prove a link to other crimes a priori. To get moving down this path would require a change of mindset, but it would not be particularly costly in absolute or relative terms. It would certainly amount to a fraction of the cost that an out-of-control fentanyl epidemic is already exacting on American lives and communities. Considering what is at stake, only a whole-of-government approach, at home and abroad, will do justice to the magnitude of the crisis. ______ Article From BBC News how the fentanyl crisis' fourth wave has hit every corner of the us Last Updated: 17th September 2023 By: Nadine Yousif https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66826895 More Americans than ever are dying from fentanyl overdoses as the fourth wave of the opioid epidemic crashes through every community, in every corner of the country. It was 6 years ago that Kim Blake's son Sean died from an accidental fentanyl overdose in Burlington, Vermont. He was 27 years old. ``Every time I hear of a loss to substance use, my heart breaks a little more,'' Ms. Blake wrote in a blog dedicated to her son in 2021. ``Another family shattered. Forever grieving the loss of dreams and celebrations.'' That year, the US witnessed a grim milestone: for the first time ever, drug overdoses killed more than 100,000 people across the country in one single year. Of those deaths, more than 66 percent were tied to fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50 times more powerful than heroin. Fentanyl is a pharmaceutical drug that can be prescribed by a doctor to treat severe pain. But the drug is also illegally manufactured and sold by criminal gangs. Most of the illegal fentanyl found in the US is trafficked from Mexico using chemicals sourced from China, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). In 2010, less than 40,000 people died from a drug overdose across the country, and less than 10 percent of those deaths were tied to fentanyl. Back then, deaths were mostly driven by the use of heroin or prescription opioids. The contrast is outlined in a study released this week by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) that examines trends in US overdose deaths from 2010-21 using data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A chart showing how fentanyl is a growing problem in the US, accounting for more and more overdose deaths over the years. The data paints a clear picture of how fentanyl has redefined drug overdoses in America over the last decade. ``The rise of illicitly manufactured fentanyl has ushered in an overdose crisis in the United States of unprecedented magnitude,'' the study's authors wrote. Virtually every corner of the US, from Hawaii to Alaska to Rhode Island, has been touched by fentanyl. The rise in fentanyl-related deaths was first observed in 2015, the data shows. Since then, the drug has spread across the US and death rates have grown sharply. ``In 2018, around 80 percent of fentanyl overdoses happened east of the Mississippi river,'' Chelsea Shover, an assistant professor at UCLA's school of medicine and co-author of the study, told the BBC. But in 2019, ``fentanyl becomes part of the drug supply in the Western US, and suddenly this population that had been insulated from it is exposed, and death rates start to go up,'' Prof Shover said. In their study, the researchers sound the alarm on another growing trend: deaths related to the use of fentanyl and another stimulant drug, like cocaine or methamphetamine. This trend is being observed across the US, albeit in different ways owing to drug use patterns that differ from region to region. For example, researchers found higher death rates related to the use of fentanyl and cocaine in north-eastern US States, like Vermont and Connecticut, where cocaine has been traditionally more available. But for virtually everywhere else in the country, from West Virginia to California, deaths were primarily driven by the use of both methamphetamines and fentanyl. Ms. Blake, who is also a trained physician, said her son sporadically used cocaine, though his toxicology report revealed only fentanyl in his system. She learned that many use fentanyl along with another stimulant for a prolonged high. ``It's no surprise to me that we're seeing such an increase in stimulant-opioid combinations,'' Ms. Blake told the BBC. When fentanyl first arrived in the US as part of the illegal drug supply, ``a lot of people did not want it'', Prof Shover said. But the synthetic opiate became widely available as it is cheaper to produce compared to other drugs. It is also highly addictive, meaning people who struggle with substance use and are exposed to it often seek it out to avoid painful withdrawals. Across the US, the study identified States like Alaska, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Hawaii and California as having the highest rates of overdose deaths involving fentanyl and another drug. These States have historically high rates of drug use, Prof Shover said. With the arrival of fentanyl, drug use in those areas has become more lethal. No longer just a ``white problem'' The opioid crisis has been traditionally portrayed as a ``white problem'', Prof Shover said. Her study, however, revealed that African Americans are dying from a combination of fentanyl and other drug use at higher rates, across age groups and geographical lines. For Rasheeda Watts-Pearson, an Ohio-based harm reduction specialist, the data reflects what she has seen in her region. She has been doing outreach work with A1 Stigma Free, a grassroots organization that was founded just 8 months ago to tackle a notable rise of overdose deaths within the African-American community in Cincinnati. As part of her work, Ms Watts-Pearson frequently visits barbershops, bars and grocery stores to talk to people about the deadly impacts of fentanyl. She said she does this because of a lack of awareness, driven partly by historic healthcare disparities experienced by racial and ethnic minority groups. Even marketing campaigns made to bring awareness to the opioid crisis have not included the experience of black Americans, she said. ``I can drive down Avondale right now, there is a billboard that says `Opioid Crisis', but there's two white people on that billboard,'' Ms Watts-Pearson said. A big blind spot for her community has been fentanyl-laced street drugs, she said, which has led to people unknowingly using the deadly, synthetic opioid, and developing a dependency to it. ``The coroner's office is seeing people overdose and die off of cocaine, off of crack, off of pills, with traces of fentanyl,'' she said. ``It has been infiltrated in the black community now, and not enough people are talking about it.'' A fourth wave The lethal use of fentanyl in combination with other drugs has marked the ``fourth wave'' of the overdose crisis in the US, researchers have said. And experts like Prof Shover have cautioned that treatment options in the US for substance use have not kept up. ``Our treatment system for substance use disorder is often focused on one drug at a time,'' Prof Shover said. ``But the reality is, many people who use drugs use more than one kind of drug.'' To keep her son's memory alive, Ms. Blake has been outspoken about her loss and has helped other families go through their grief of losing a loved one to an overdose. ``Everyone has a story, and for a parent who has lost a child, that is forever,'' she said. Her son had been enrolled in treatment a few times during his battle with substance use disorder. The experience taught Ms. Blake that care options vary from State to State, and in many cases, what is available is not enough. ``Ideally, I think we would see something where people would get treatment rapidly, whenever they want it, and long-term,'' she said. Ms. Blake also raised the idea of overdose prevention sites, where people could use drugs safely and under supervision. Those sites are widely available in Canada--which has its own fentanyl crisis--but only two sanctioned sites exist in the US. Above all, Ms Blake has called for compassion and understanding for those who are struggling with substance use. ``Most people I talk to, their kids did not want to die,'' she said. Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you. Mr. LaLota. The gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Carter, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Carter. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. Before I begin, I want to personally thank these brave witnesses for being here. Our heart goes out to you and your families for your incredible loss. We all recognize the significance and the importance of this matter. It has been brought to my attention that our Chairman, as we speak, is in the hallway doing an interview with FOX News instead of listening to the testimony of these heartbroken parents. I think that demonstrates just where we should be. We should be here, not talking to talking heads and feeding into that. You know, my colleagues have spent the past year blaming Secretary Mayorkas for long-standing issues like immigration, drug addiction, crime, and so forth. However, impeachment over differences in policy is not Constitutional. It also solves exactly nothing for the problems that we were sent here to Congress to solve. It is high time that we, as Members of Congress, must come together to pass laws that combat fentanyl in our communities and fund drug treatment programs to help save lives, not to determine who has the biggest megaphone or the biggest political voice to exact vengeance. Our job is to serve and to come up with solutions together, Republican and Democrat, to solve our Nation's problems. Professor Pearlstein, would impeaching Secretary Mayorkas over policy differences between the Biden administration and House Republicans solve any problems facing our country? Ms. Pearlstein. I don't believe it would. The President retains exclusive Constitutional power to replace Secretary Mayorkas with another official who he would charge with pursuing exactly the same policies here. Mr. Carter. Is it a bit disingenuous to suggest that somehow this is new, the issues that we are facing are new at the border, and somehow that it was perfect before Secretary Mayorkas took over? Ms. Pearlstein. My knowledge, just based on Supreme Court cases, of the number of cases that have arisen surrounding Executive actions over border policies, and reading the history there, suggests that these problems have existed through 5 administrations over decades, largely because Congress has enacted contradictory laws that are impossible to comply with, and multiple administrations have struggled to resolve that contradiction. Mr. Carter. Many of the Republicans complain that the Biden administration and Secretary Mayorkas are not doing enough on immigration, border security, fentanyl, or crime. Professor Pearlstein, does Congress have any role in resolving these long-standing issues? If so, please explain. Ms. Pearlstein. Thank you, Representative. As I've mentioned before, Congress has a central role. Indeed, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held, in cases going back more than a century, that Congress' power in this area is plenary, meaning absolute. That is not to say that the Executive doesn't retain under his own Article II authority enforcement power, but Congress cannot only appropriate funds, it can pose conditions on funds. In the opinion folks are so fond of citing in the recent Supreme Court cases, while impeachment is certainly one power that Congress has, oversight, appropriations, the legislative process, Senate confirmations, withholding funds, and, of course, centrally, elections are old tools that are available to Congress and to the American people to effect change here. Mr. Carter. Are withholding funds because you are unhappy with the Secretary in any way helpful to the issues that these two grieving mothers have faced and others may continue to face? Ms. Pearlstein. I can't imagine that it is. Mr. Carter. I have got a--Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter this into the record. ``Synthetic opioid overdose deaths soared while Trump was President.'' Not my words. This report, March 2, 2023. Mr. Higgins . Without objection.  Article From Forbes synthetic opioid overdose deaths soared while trump was president Stuart Anderson, Senior Contributor, Forbes Mar 2, 2023, 09:22am EST Updated Mar 2, 2023, 09:30am EST Overdose deaths from synthetic opioids soared during the time Donald Trump was president, raising questions about efforts to blame the Biden administration's border policies for drug overdose deaths. Data show the Trump administration's decision to close U.S. ports of entry to nonessential traffic during the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020 had the consequence of accelerating drug traffickers' shift to fentanyl, a more potent drug than heroin, which helped lead to an increase in drug overdose deaths. Between 2016 and 2020, annual drug overdose deaths from synthetic opioids (excluding methadone) increased by 192 percent (from 19,500 to 56,894), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC data also show: The average annual growth rate of drug overdose deaths from synthetic opioids was 31 percent while Donald Trump was president. Between 2019 and 2020, the last year of Trump's presidency, the increase in drug overdose deaths from synthetic opioids was 55 percent. Between 2020 and 2021, the first year of Joe Biden's presidency, the increase in drug overdose deaths from synthetic opioids was 25 percent. Because fentanyl is so potent in small quantities, it is dangerous for users but profitable for drug traffickers. The Trump administration's decision to shut down all but nonessential traffic at U.S.-Mexico ports of entry on March 20, 2020, appears to have spurred traffickers to shift from heroin to fentanyl. ``Despite fentanyl's built-in economic advantage, it took the massive restriction in imports and travel during the pandemic-- particularly the U.S. policy of limiting travel with Mexico--to force U.S.-Mexico border traffickers to shift from heroin to fentanyl,'' testified David Bier of the Cato Institute during a House Homeland Security Committee hearing (February 28, 2023). ``Within 2 months of the pandemic, fentanyl seizures overtook heroin by weight, and by the time the restrictions were lifted, fentanyl was accounting for over 90 percent of the seizures.'' (The weight of fentanyl seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection increased tenfold between December 2019 and December 2020.) CDC data show unusually large increases in the 12-month moving average of drug overdose deaths from synthetic opioids in April, May, June, July, and August 2020, which continued through the remainder of the calendar year, based on a National Foundation for American Policy analysis. Precise month-by-month figures are unavailable from the CDC, but even the 12-month moving averages, which likely mask much larger increases in individual months, show a significant rise after the March 2020 closing of U.S.-Mexico ports of entry to nonessential traffic. Some Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee criticized Bier for his testimony as it ran counter to the hearing's title, ``Every State Is a Border State: Examining Secretary Mayorkas' Border Crisis.'' Bier explained that asylum seekers are the least likely people to carry fentanyl across the U.S.-Mexico border since they immediately turn themselves in to Border Patrol Agents or ask for asylum, when permitted, at ports of entry. A more orderly process for people seeking protection would free up law enforcement resources. (Bier was not given a chance to respond to several assertions by Republican members and published additional responses after the hearing.) Democratic committee members pointed out through questioning that the vast majority (93 percent) of fentanyl is seized at ports of entry or checkpoints--not between ports of entry by Border Patrol agents. Moreover, Democratic members noted those convicted for smuggling fentanyl are primarily U.S. citizens (86 percent). Democrats at the hearing did not point out that synthetic opioid deaths increased significantly while Donald Trump was President. This was surprising since even Republican Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark E. Green (R-TN) noted in his opening statement that the two sons of the mother who testified at the hearing died of ``fentanyl poisoning in 2020.'' While blaming immigrants for the fentanyl crisis may have political appeal, research by professors Ben Feldmeyer (Univ. of Cincinnati), Diana Sun (Florida Atlantic University), Casey T. Harris (Univ. of Arkansas) and Francis T. Cullen (Univ. of Cincinnati) found immigrants are associated with fewer drug overdoses and homicides in an area. ``Our findings directly contradict the pervasive fears and political rhetoric suggesting that immigration has fueled drug problems across U.S. communities,'' according to the authors, who analyzed data from 2000 to 2015. ``We see no evidence linking immigration to rising overdose death rates, and instead we find that immigration has most often been associated with lower levels of overdoses and homicide mortality. Thus, it appears that, if anything, immigration is more likely to have been part of the solution than the source of the overdose crisis of the early twenty-first century.'' Feldmeyer, Sun, Harris and Cullen found, ``County overdose rates were reduced by 4.5 percent for every 1-percentage-point increase in the foreign-born population . . . Taken together, these supplemental models show sizable protective effects of immigration and suggest that a 10-percentage-point increase in a county's foreign-born population could contribute to as much as 40 percent to 50 percent lower overdose death rates overall and for nearly each of the substances examined here, net of controls.'' The evidence indicates that closing the door to immigration will not reduce deaths from drug overdoses. The data show that stopping most traffic at U.S.-Mexico ports of entry in 2020 while Donald Trump was President had the unintended consequence of encouraging drug traffickers to switch from heroin to fentanyl, which contributed to an increase in synthetic opioid-related deaths in America. Mr. Carter. Between 2019 and 2020, the last year of Trump's Presidency, the increase in drug overdose deaths from synthetic opioid was at 55 percent. Between 2020 and 2021, the first year of Joe Biden's Presidency, the increase in drug overdose deaths from synthetic opioid was at 25 percent. Not my words. I will enter this into the record. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. But I will tell you this, this is nothing to be proud of, that one President had higher than another, but it is a fact that requires discussion. But it isn't anything to be proud of because if it were just 1 percent, if it was just one daughter, one son, one child that was impacted by this horrible drug that is in our communities now, that comes across our borders now, not necessarily by immigrants, but primarily by those that are seeking to do harm and to enter the drug trade. What do we do when we strip off our party veils and say, let's fix this issue regardless of our party? Let's take away the notion that this one man, Secretary Mayorkas, is this boogeyman, and we send a message to the rest of the world, if we can just get rid of him, all of our problems would go away. It isn't fair. It is disingenuous. It is misleading to the American people. They deserve better and we can do better. Mr. Chairman, I yield. Mr. Higgins. The gentlemen yields. The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Gimenez, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Gimenez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Pearlstein, do you believe that dereliction of duty is an impeachable offense? Ms. Pearlstein. The only examples in U.S. history I cited in my testimony. The words ``dereliction of duty'' weren't charged. They weren't the Articles of Impeachment. But those circumstances were where judges, the officers at issue, were either chronically drunk or mentally incapable of performing their duties, or both. Mr. Gimenez. Do you believe that failure to uphold your oath to protect the homeland, is that an impeachable offense? Ms. Pearlstein. I don't believe that anybody has ever been impeached for a failure to uphold the oath. Mr. Gimenez. I didn't ask the question. I said, do you believe that somebody who fails to uphold their oath to protect the homeland, is that an impeachable offense? Ms. Pearlstein. I believe that somebody who acts in his own interests or the interests of gaining his own power or in the interests of a foreign power is impeachable. Mr. Gimenez. So you don't think that somebody who fails to uphold the oath to protect the homeland and does it in a way that is a dereliction of duty, you don't believe that that is impeachable? That somehow Congress doesn't have the right to exercise its power of impeachment to remove that individual who is clearly violating his oath and is derelict in his duty? You don't think that Congress can do that? Ms. Pearlstein. I don't know that there's evidence here of dereliction of duty. Mr. Gimenez. I didn't say there is evidence. Ms. Pearlstein. With respect to the violation of the oath-- -- Mr. Gimenez. I am not asking evidence. Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am---- Ms. Pearlstein . If it's a violation of the oath, then---- Mr. Gimenez. Ma'am, I reclaim my time. I reclaim my time. I would like for you to answer my question, not your question. OK? My question is very specific. I didn't say about this case. I am just talking in general. All right? OK? Ms. Pearlstein. In general, depending on the circumstances, depending on the violations of the Constitution, it is conceivable, yes. Mr. Gimenez. OK. So if we determine that Mr. Mayorkas is derelict in his duty and has failed to uphold his oath to protect the homeland, in our opinion, OK, then is that an impeachable offense? Ms. Pearlstein. Again, dereliction of duty is different from failure to comply with the oath. Right? To the extent the oath---- Mr. Gimenez. I said both. Ms. Pearlstein . Has a variety of things---- Mr. Gimenez. I said both, so. Ms. Pearlstein. Well, they're two different legal arguments. Mr. Gimenez. I have said both. OK? Ms. Pearlstein. So, I've addressed the question, but---- Mr. Gimenez. Can't you be guilty of having doing two things at the same time? Ms. Pearlstein. I've addressed the impeachability of dereliction of duty. Mr. Gimenez. OK, very good. Ms. Pearlstein. The question of the oath is something separate. To the extent it raises an allegation of a violation of the Constitution, it is potentially impeachable. But here the Supreme Court has rejected that argument. Mr. Gimenez. I don't believe they have. But anyway, I will move on. Is a violation of law, when an individual clearly violates the law, is that an impeachable offense? Depending on the law, I guess, right? I mean, how serious that law is. Is that your interpretation? Ms. Pearlstein. Impeachment, right, is only about a certain category of offenses. It only addresses a certain category of offenses. It has to be an offense similar to treason or bribery. That is an offense against the system of government, not any ordinary criminal offense, something that disrupts the structure of the Constitution or system of government. Mr. Gimenez. Very good. OK, thank you. So allowing millions and millions of people to come into the United States, violating the clear intent of Congress, when it says that in order to be paroled in the United States it has to be done on a case-by-case basis, and then you do it on a mass basis, that actually may have something, you know, to affect--may affect the land, it may affect the structure of government. I would argue that. So I guess it is up to the Supreme Court to determine that eventually. Now, Ms. Dunn, let me say that, you know, I feel deeply for you and your loss. Actually, in my extended family, we had the same kind of loss due to fentanyl. Do you believe that the multinational criminal organizations, the cartels that are working across the border, do you believe that they are terrorist organizations, for lack of a better word? Mrs. Dunn. Yes, sir, I do. Mr. Gimenez. And they are guilty of mass murder? Mrs. Dunn. Yes, sir, I do believe that. Mr. Gimenez. I do, too. I believe also one of the things that Mr. Mayorkas has shown to be derelict in his duty is the absolute failure of this administration to combat what I consider to be terrorist organizations, which are the Mexican drug cartels that control the border. By the way, I also believe the Biden administration is actually helping those organizations. By not stemming the flow of illegal immigration they are enriching those multinational organizations to the tune of billions of dollars, which allows them to produce more fentanyl, which allows them to kill tens of thousands of American citizens. So for that, too, I believe that Mr. Mayorkas has failed miserably in his duty to protect the homeland. With that, my time has expired and I yield back. Thank you. Mr. Higgins. The gentlemen yields. Mr. Thanedar is recognized for 5 minutes for questions. Mr. Thanedar. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to thank all of our witnesses here today. My sincere condolences to our witnesses. As a father and a grandfather, I sympathize with your unimaginable loss. As a Member of Congress, I realize it is my duty and my colleagues' duty to do all we can to prevent tragedies like this from impacting our communities. That is why one of my first act as a freshman Member of Congress was introducing an amendment to the Republicans H.R. 2 border bill, which they are now threatening to shut the Government down over, which aimed to bolster the Department of Homeland Security's efforts to combat cross- border threats posed by transnational criminal organizations. This amendment, which would have strengthened DHS's ability to combat organizations engaging in criminal activity such as drug trafficking and human smuggling, was voted down by every single Republican Member citing in this hearing room today-- sitting in this hearing room today and on this committee. While Republicans voted this and every other Democratic amendment down, I know enacting meaningful legislation is needed to address the issues at the Southern Border. That is why I have introduced the United Against Transnational Criminal Organizations Act. Several of my Democratic colleagues on this committee have signed on to this bill, which directs DHS to take a range of actions to combat illicit criminal cartel activity that undermines our homeland security. The bill directs DHS to establish a joint task force, bringing together multiple agency components to conduct operations to combat cross-border threats posed by TCOs and organizations engaged in the trafficking of fentanyl and its materials across the land border of United States. This bill directs DHS to establish an integrated border intelligence analytical cell to improve information sharing regarding the concentrated surge of migration, smuggling, and trafficking. Since we know a vast amount of fentanyl is trafficked through our ports of entry, it requires DHS to issue a strategy to improve the effectiveness of the screening of vehicles, persons, and cargo at land ports of entry that are at high risk of being related to transnational criminal organizations. My question to you, Professor Pearlstein, would you agree that a legislation such as my United Against Transnational Criminal Organizations Act is a more effective measure to solving the issues at our border versus impeaching a Secretary over policy differences? Ms. Pearlstein. Thank you, Mr. Thanedar. Again, I'm not an immigration policy expert, but the bill that you propose is certainly within Congress' power to enact. It may have an effect on immigration policy. Impeachment will have no effect on immigration policy. Mr. Thanedar. Thank you. Mr. Chair, I yield back. Mr. Higgins. The gentlemen yields. The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Pfluger, is recognized for 5 minutes for questions. Mr. Pfluger. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Ms. Nobles and Ms. Dunn, I am so sorry for your loss. We can't even fathom the loss that you have gone through and your courage to be here to speak out, to bring light to the situation, to speak the truth, is not only commended, but it is necessary so that we avoid this pain for other families. Thank you for being here. Professor Pearlstein, are you familiar with the William Belknap case that you mentioned in your testimony? Like you are intimately familiar with it as a Constitutional law expert? Ms. Pearlstein. I'm generally familiar with the Belknap impeachment, yes. Mr. Pfluger. You wrote about it in your testimony, correct? Ms. Pearlstein. I did, yes. Mr. Pfluger. Is there a reason that you left out the fact that Article III of that impeachment case mentioned the disregarding of his duty as Secretary of War? Ms. Pearlstein. No. Mr. Pfluger. Was it particularly helpful to your argument today? Ms. Pearlstein. I'm not sure what the question is. Mr. Pfluger. Was there a reason you left that out? Ms. Pearlstein. I wasn't giving a full book report on the Belknap impeachment. Mr. Pfluger. Yeah. Ms. Pearlstein. I was mentioning it in my testimony---- Mr. Pfluger. That is fine. Ms. Pearlstein . As the only other instance in U.S. history in which Congress has ever bothered with the time to---- Mr. Pfluger. Right, in Article III of that--thank you. That is the only other history. Ms. Pearlstein . Impeach a Cabinet officer. Mr. Pfluger. What we are talking about is unprecedented disregarding of his duty. I am going to quote you, ``There the professors were reasonably uniform in recognizing that it doesn't have to be a crime, that is to say, an impeachable offense doesn't have to be a crime, as currently embodied in the Federal Criminal Code as enacted by Congress. What they were thinking about with the impeachment remedy were serious offenses against the public trust. That is, certain things that only the President and other senior officials could do that abuse their authority.'' Did you, in fact, say this with regards to the Trump impeachment? Ms. Pearlstein. I have said many things about impeachment. I don't--it's entirely possible that I said that, and I would still agree with it actually. Mr. Pfluger. Mr. Chairman, I would like to insert for the record Professor Pearlstein's comments on a radio show in New York, on a podcast in 2019, regarding the Trump administration. Chairman Green. Without objection, so ordered.** --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ** The information has been previously inserted on page 37. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mr. Pfluger. Thank you. So do you believe--will you define impeachment with regards to the public trust, as you said it there, with regards to Trump? If the public trust is broken, is that an impeachable offense? Ms. Pearlstein. Public trust in this context refers to two kinds of breaches of the public trust, generally. One is an official who is acting in his own personal interest, right, to aggrandize his own political wealth, interests, power, et cetera, as opposed to the interests of the American people. That's an example of a breach of the public trust. The other is if an official is acting on behalf of a foreign power, which is another example of a breach of a public trust. Yes. I thought those issues were both implicated in the Trump Ukraine impeachment. Mr. Pfluger. Do you believe that public trust has been broken with regards to the common defense of our country? Ms. Pearlstein. As a general matter---- Mr. Pfluger . The collective defense of our country? Ms. Pearlstein. As a general matter, I'm not sure I can answer that question. That, broadly stated, has the public. I'm not aware of any evidence. For example, that Secretary Mayorkas has been acting for his own personal wealth or aggrandizement. Mr. Pfluger. OK. That's fine. But in general, is breaking the public trust in an egregious manner grounds for an impeachment proceeding? Ms. Pearlstein. In the way I just defined breaking the public trust, that is, acting on behalf of one's own interests as opposed to the interests of the public, yes, that can be an impeachable ground if there is evidence of that. Mr. Pfluger. Are you licensed in a State? Ms. Pearlstein. Am I a member of the bar, do you mean? Mr. Pfluger. Of the bar, yeah. Ms. Pearlstein. Yes, I'm a member of the bar of the State of California, and I'm a member of the bar of Washington, DC. Mr. Pfluger. Is it your responsibility to uphold the laws in those States in which you are a member of the bar? Ms. Pearlstein. I have all of the same ethical obligations that any attorney has. Mr. Pfluger. When you take the oath of office as a Cabinet member to well and faithfully execute the duties of the office, does that infer a responsibility to uphold the laws as well? Ms. Pearlstein. Anybody who takes an oath to take care that the laws are faithfully executed has an oath to take care that the laws are faithfully executed, yes. Mr. Pfluger. Did you condemn the attacks by Hamas on Israel? Ms. Pearlstein. I'm not sure what that has to do with anything. Mr. Pfluger. It is a question. Did you condemn the attacks? Ms. Pearlstein. My personal view of those attacks is that they were abhorrent. I don't think I have had occasion to speak about it publicly. It is not my area of expertise. Mr. Pfluger. Mr. Chair, I yield back. Thank you. Chairman Green. The gentlemen yields. I now recognize Mr. Magaziner, the gentleman from Rhode Island, for his 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Magaziner. Thank you, Chairman. I want to thank our witnesses for having the courage to share their stories and their expertise today. We have real challenges at the border. I have been there, I have seen it, and I know that the American people are counting on Congress to act. Unfortunately, too many of my Republican colleagues are more focused on playing politics instead of working together to address our problems. The Biden administration has requested $14 billion to secure the border, funding that would hire more than 1,300 Border Patrol agents and more than 1,000 CBP officers. House Republicans have refused to call a vote on this funding for nearly 4 months. They have sat on this proposal for nearly 4 months, undercutting their claim that they really care about border security. If you care about it, call a vote. If you don't like all of the proposal, call a vote on the parts that you do like. When House Republicans were asked why they won't call a vote on the President's border funding request, one of them said, ``Let me tell you, I'm not willing to do too damn much right now to help a Democrat and to help Joe Biden's approval rating.'' That tells you all you need to know. He was more concerned about Joe Biden's approval rating than about fixing the problems at the border. He's not the only one. Laura Ingram on FOX News said that Republicans should not accept any border deal because it would be ``a victory for Biden.'' Even Speaker Johnson has openly mused that House Republicans will not accept more border funding until there is a Republican President. Now, some of my colleagues say, well, funding is not enough. We need policy changes at the border, too. OK. Over the last month, through the holidays, Secretary Mayorkas has been working diligently with Senate Republicans and Senate Democrats to try to come up with a policy plan for the border. Where have House Republicans been in those talks? MIA, not participating. They gave themselves a vacation for a month. Well, imagine if the reverse were the truth. Imagine if House Republicans were actually working with the Senate on a border plan and Secretary Mayorkas decided to go on vacation for a month. What would people say about that? Instead, you know, this phrase, ``dereliction of duty'' gets thrown around a lot. It is my House Republican colleagues who have been derelict in their duty. They have refused to call a vote on border funding for 4 months. They have refused to participate in the talks with the Secretary and the Senate to put a border plan together. What have they been doing instead? Playing politics. They passed a budget plan, the so-called Limit, Save, Grow Act, which would have cut the Department of Homeland Security by 22 percent, eliminating 2,000 CBP officers at the border. Every one of them voted for that. When the Biden administration requested $84 million to help States and cities with the costs associated with migration, House Republicans instead cut it to zero. Some House Republicans have openly called for shutting down the Government this week, even though they know that that means that Border Patrol agents who are already overworked and underpaid would be forced to work without any pay at all. Now they are playing politics with impeachment, even though there is no legal basis for impeaching the Secretary. I have heard that this is going to be our final impeachment hearing. Still, House Republicans have yet to clearly articulate what laws they think the Secretary has broken. They have not brought in a single legal expert who is willing to put up their hand and, under oath, state that there is a sound legal basis for impeachment. The best they could do last week was a handful of Republican politicians. They invited the Secretary to appear in a hearing to defend himself against their ambiguous charges. Then when he sent a letter back on January 11 saying that he would appear, they reneged on his invitation and disinvited him. But the sad thing about these political games is that this is wasted time. This is time that we could be spending to work together on real solutions for the border, real solutions to solve the fentanyl crisis, real solutions to combat the cartels and create a safe and orderly system at the border. Senate Democrats are working on it as we speak. Senate Republicans are working on it as we speak. The Secretary is working on it as we speak. It is only House Republicans who are putting politics ahead of doing the work to solve our problems. Professor, for those of us who are serious about trying to improve the situation at the border, is impeachment Congress' most effective tool to do it or are there other powers that Congress has that would be better suited to fixing the situation at the border? Ms. Pearlstein. Thank you, Congressman. As I've said, impeachment in this context will have no effect on administration or American border policy. Congress has a host of tools at its disposal, as the Supreme Court recently listed and as I've testified to, including, of course, appropriations, oversight hearings, legislative process, Senate confirmations, withholding funds, and then, of course, as I've mentioned before, elections, and there are others as well. Mr. Magaziner. Thank you, Professor. I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentlemen yields. We a going to take a 10-minute break to give our witnesses an opportunity to take a break, and we will reconvene at we will say 11:40. The committee is adjourned--or is in recess.  Chairman Green. The committee will come to order. I now recognize the gentlelady from Georgia, Mrs. Greene, for her 5 minutes of testimony. Ms. Greene. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So far today on this very important historic hearing, we have listened to Democrats complain that Republicans have done nothing to stop the border security crisis, pretending that we didn't pass H.R. 2, the strongest border bill that has ever been passed in Congress. All of our Democrat colleagues voted no to that bill. My Democrat colleagues today are complaining that they need more money. Well, it seems to be from listening on this committee, most of the time they want more money to help more migrants come into the country. It is unfortunate that it is about migrants. It should be about Americans. I have also listened to them talk about impeachment, talking about impeachment, saying that impeachment is not the right thing to do when it comes to Secretary Mayorkas, complaining about impeachment hearings. But I would like to remind everyone that when they impeached President Trump, they introduced Articles of Impeachment on January 11, held zero hearings, and then passed these Articles of Impeachment on January 13. Oh, my, oh, my. The hypocrisy. But let's talk a little bit further. Let's talk about something I heard from one of our witnesses today, saying that impeachment is needed or necessary or warranted when this person has acted in the interest of a foreign power, that that is an impeachable offense. Well, let's talk about how we could argue Secretary Mayorkas has definitely acted for a foreign power. A former special agent for DEA's Special Operations Division testified under oath that the cartels have control over the United States' Southern Border. The cartels, not our government, not our Border Patrol. That is a foreign power. Cartels and coyotes are making around $13 billion a year in human trafficking alone off Joe Biden's open border policies and Secretary Mayorkas' willful, willful disobedience in his job. The revenue is 26 times more than cartels earned under President Trump. Twenty-six times more. That would definitely be helping a foreign power. I am sure that money is spent in countries like Mexico. That helps their economy. Cartels control approximately 40 percent of Mexico. The cartels do. That means that this border crisis and the laws that are being broken are definitely in the interest of a foreign power. Now, we are also hearing a debate back and forth about policy. Is it a policy difference or is it Secretary Mayorkas' disobedience and his willfulness to break our Federal laws? I ask that question because I want to know, is it the Biden administration's policy to kill 300 Americans every single day to fentanyl? Is it the Biden administration's policy that cartel members are allowed to come in our country and are released? These are unaccompanied minors. Are they allowed by the Biden administration's policy to come in the country and rape and murder young women? Is it the Biden administration's policy for nearly 100,000 unaccompanied minor children to go missing in our country? Is it the Biden administration's policy for child labor, migrant child labor that was talked about in the New York Times, is that the Biden administration's policy? If so, then maybe we shouldn't be having hearings on my Articles of Impeachment to impeach Secretary Mayorkas. Maybe we should be holding Articles of Impeachment on the President of the United States. Is that where we are going? What do you think about that, Ms. Pearlstein? Do you think is it a policy difference or is it Secretary Mayorkas? Which one, Biden, Joe Biden or Secretary Mayorkas? Ms. Pearlstein. My impression of the allegations that the Majority has raised here is that they are entirely about policy differences with the---- Ms. Greene. Ms. Pearlstein, you have talked about policy in your testimony today. Policy, so that would be Joe Biden. I am sure you voted for him for President. You have been talking about the Biden administration's policy has been the cause of all of this. So is it Joe Biden's policy, the administration's policy, or is it Secretary Mayorkas? Ms. Pearlstein. The Constitution, no matter which official, says that impeachment---- Ms. Greene. Ms. Pearlstein, I asked you a question. Is it the Biden administration or is it Secretary Mayorkas? Not the Constitution. We are not talking about the Constitution. Is it the Biden administration's open border policies or is it Secretary Mayorkas breaking Federal law? One or the other, because the statistics are clear. Are you capable of answering that question? Ms. Pearlstein. I am not sure. Those were about four questions. Ms. Greene. No, it is one or the other, Biden administration open border policies or Secretary Mayorkas? Ms. Pearlstein. One or the other what? Who caused it? Ms. Greene. That has caused 300 Americans to die every single day. These two women sitting next to you's daughters have been murdered. We are talking about over 100,000--I am sorry, nearly 100,000 unaccompanied minors missing in this country. We are talking about cartel members everywhere, the cartel controlling the Southern Border. We are talking about the massive increase in statistics. It is either one or the other. It is either the Biden administration's open-border policies or it is Secretary Mayorkas. Ms. Pearlstein. Ma'am---- Ms. Greene. OK. We will take it---- Ms. Pearlstein . I'm a professor of Constitutional law. Ms. Greene. No, you can't point to the Constitution. Chairman Green. All right. So we are a little over here. The gentlelady yields. Ms. Greene. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Green. I now recognize Mr. Ivey for his 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Ivey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to start off, we are going to show a clip from an interview that involved former Secretary Chertoff, and I wanted to play that now, if we can.  Mr. Ivey. Thank you. Then shortly after that, former Secretary Johnson said, we can't have a Secretary who is distracted by a stunt in Congress and an attempted impeachment. Similarly, we have had other quotes, I think, from Congressman Ken Buck, a Republican Congressman, who has raised similar concerns about--well, who stated, basically, there are no grounds for impeachment. Also, Professor Jonathan Turley, who testified. Now, Turley is important here because he is the witness that the Republicans called to testify at the oversight hearing that maybe Ms. Greene, I think, was referencing with respect to President Biden. He said that, you know, at that hearing that there was no evidence to impeach President Biden. He sent us a letter to this committee saying the same thing with respect to Secretary Mayorkas. Thanks. So I want to sort-of point out a couple of things here with respect to that. To the extent we have had hearings that have discussed this issue of impeachment, from a legal standard, from a Constitutional standpoint, the only witnesses who have actually addressed it directly are Professor Bowman, who testified at the last hearing, and Professor Pearlstein, who is testifying today. There is no testimony to the contrary that they have provided that was given by the witnesses that the Republicans have called. I suggest that that is in part, or maybe in whole, because they don't have experts who will come in and say--legal experts, Constitutional scholars who are experienced with respect to impeachment, who will come in here and raise their right hand and swear under oath that the Constitution justifies impeachment with respect to Secretary Mayorkas in this case. The absence of the testimony, the Ranking Member raised due process issues at the beginning of the hearing, I would suggest that this goes to the heart of it. If there is no evidence that the Republicans have presented about actual impeachment, the standard in the Constitution being violated, we should not be moving forward with impeachment under these circumstances. I also note Professor Pearlstein's testimony, the point about even if you don't like the policies that Secretary Mayorkas is implementing and you impeach him and the Senate removes him, which they are not going to, we have already heard from Senators over there who have said you are wasting the time, let's focus on actual legislation that they are trying to work out and get done, but even if you remove him, President Biden's just going to move up the acting administrator, I suppose, Acting Secretary who would continue to implement the same policy. So it is a waste of time, as Secretary Chertoff called it. It is a political stunt. But more importantly, I mean, it is a total distraction from actually trying to get the legislation done. It is hard to ignore the fact that the Senate is having bipartisan negotiations on the behalf of the Democrats and the Republicans to try and pass a bill or put together a bill that would address these issues. The White House is working with them. House Democrats are working with them. Only the House Republicans are no-shows. They did the field trip to the border and did the photo op and sent it back, but they haven't decided to move forward with actually fixing the issues on that front. Just the last point I will make on that front, H.R. 2, there is a lot of talk about that is been passed and it is sitting on, you know, Schumer's desk. But it is not on his desk, it is in the trash can. You know what? It is in McConnell's trash can, too. They said that before it was passed through, they said, you got all these poison pill provisions in here. We are not going to move this. Send us something we can actually work with. You didn't. So now they are trying to put a bill together and everybody is on board with that effort, except House Republicans. So if we really want to get something done, let's all come together and work on it so we can pass legislation that addresses the problem. With that, I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentlemen yields. I now recognize Mr. Ezell, the gentleman from Mississippi, for his 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all of our witnesses today for being here and providing this important information that we need. Ms. Nobles, thank you for joining us here today. I can't imagine how tough it is. Must be discussing this over and over again about the Mayorkas failed border security policy. I genuinely appreciate you sharing the challenging stories and emphasizing the importance of border security. Americans are demanding we do something. With over 40 years in law enforcement, including the sheriff, I truly understand how challenging it is to ensure the safety of our communities. I never stopped, slowed down, or prevented my officers from enforcing the law. I swore an oath to protect the citizens of my community. Somehow, Secretary Mayorkas is making this tough job even tougher for our men and women of Border Patrol. Ms. Nobles, a report from the House Judiciary Committee pointed out several failures in vetting your daughter's killer when he crossed the border. The report showed your daughter's murderer was arrested for associations with MS-13 long before he came to the United States, something that could have been verified with a simple phone call. But our members of Border Patrol are not being allowed to do their jobs. They told me this personally when we were down there last year. Instead, there are nurse-maiding and making sandwiches for criminals while all this stuff goes on. You know, the buck stops at the top. This could have immediately disqualified this killer from getting in the country had they been able to do their jobs that they have been hired to do. The report also noted that he was released after he was arrested for murder. Ms. Noble, do you have any reason to believe that Secretary Mayorkas has taken these reports seriously? Ms. Nobles. No, he hasn't. Mr. Ezell. To me, the reports are clear, his policies are failing. Do you believe he is trying to change the process of the vetting illegal aliens coming across our border? Ms. Nobles. No. If he was, then my daughter would still be here today, if they did their jobs. They did not do their jobs. Mr. Ezell. It is no secret how gruesome and violent the cartels are. I have seen it personally myself. In many cases, they are even better armed than local law enforcement. In your opening statement, you quote, ``This isn't about immigration. This is about protecting everyone in the United States of America.'' Again, the American citizens are demanding that we take action. Ms. Nobles, do you believe that Secretary Mayorkas' policies are strengthening the cartels? Do you believe that his policies are strengthening the cartels? Ms. Nobles. Yes. Mr. Ezell. No mother or father should ever have to endure hearing chilling news that their child has been a victim of such a violent, heinous crime. Unfortunately, as a sheriff, I have delivered this devastating news to families. It is one of the most difficult things you will ever do as a law enforcement officer. To end, I will simply ask, do you believe this crisis has been created by the Biden administration's policies? Ms. Nobles. Yes. Mr. Ezell. Thank you again, and thank you all for being here today. We will continue to be your voice. We will continue to take action. No matter what the other side says, we are going to do something to stop this. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Ms. Ramirez, the gentlelady from Illinois, for her 5 minutes of questioning. Mrs. Ramirez. Thank you, Chairman and Ranking Member. I want to begin by acknowledging the losses here today. Ms. Nobles, Ms. Dunn, I am grieved that you have endured losing your daughters, Kayla Marie and Ashley. No parent should ever have to go through this loss. No parent. I also want to acknowledge the losses that are not described today. I want to name a couple of those: Virterma de la Sancha Cerros, 33-year-old mother; Yorlei Rubi, 10 years old; and Jonathan Agustin Briones de la Sancha, 8 years old. They lost their lives when cruel policy choices and willful obstruction of intergovernmental coordination by the Abbott administration in Texas kept Border Patrol agents from responding to rescue a drowning mother and her children. Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask unanimous consent to enter these two articles into the record: ``Three migrants, including two children, drowned near the Texas border,'' and ``An 8-year-old migrant died after a week in U.S. detention.'' Chairman Green. Without objection, so ordered.  Articles Submitted by Hon. Delia C. Ramirez 3 migrants, including 2 children, drown near texas border According to Customs and Border Protection, Federal agents were ``physically barred'' by State officials from responding to the situation. Texas officials said that was ``wholly inaccurate.'' By Colbi Edmonds, Jan. 14, 2024, New York Times https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/14/us/migrants-drown-texas- dispute.html Three migrants drowned in the Rio Grande by Eagle Pass, Texas, officials said Saturday, setting off a dispute among State and Federal officials in what seemed to escalate the feud between the Biden administration and Gov. Greg Abbott over the stringent security measures the State has imposed to keep migrants from entering the country. According to the Department of Homeland Security, Border Patrol agents received a distress call from Mexican authorities about a woman and two children who were trying to cross into the United States near the entrance of Shelby Park, which Mr. Abbott recently closed to curb migration. Homeland Security said that when Border Patrol agents tried to respond to the call, they were ``physically barred'' by Texas Military Department agents from accessing the area. But the military department said when Border Patrol agents requested access, the migrants had already drowned, adding that claims that it had prevented the agents from saving them were ``wholly inaccurate.'' For more than 2 years, Mr. Abbott has been testing the legal limits of what a State can do to enforce immigration law, expanding the use of concertina wire along the riverbank and installing buoy barriers to discourage migrants from crossing. But Border Patrol officials in the area have complained that those moves have made it harder for agents to help migrants in distress. And a Homeland Security spokesperson said Texas officials must stop interfering with Federal law enforcement. ``The Texas Governor's policies are cruel, dangerous and inhumane and Texas' blatant disregard for Federal authority over immigration poses grave risks,'' the spokesperson said in a statement. The military department said its agents searched the Rio Grande with lights and night-vision goggles but did not see any migrants trying to cross. The department said that its agents confirmed that when the Federal agents tried to get into Shelby Park, they said that Mexican authorities had already recovered the bodies of two of the migrants. The Mexican government confirmed that its National Guard recovered three migrants' bodies and rescued two other Mexican people. The Texas Military Department denied that it was made aware of any dire situation or people in need of assistance near Shelby Park. ``At no time did T.M.D. security personnel along the river observe any distressed migrants, nor did T.M.D. turn back any illegal immigrants from the U.S. during this period,'' it said in a statement. The Times could not independently confirm the events that occurred around the drownings. In response to the deaths, U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar, a Democrat representing a portion of South Texas that includes San Antonio, said over the phone on Sunday, ``The State should not be preventing Border Patrol from doing its job in that area.'' Eagle Pass is a small border town that saw up to 5,000 migrant crossings a day during the height of the influx. More recently, that number has gone down to around 400 to 500, Mayor Rolando Salinas Jr. said in a news conference last week. Many migrants crossing the border are in urgent need of medical attention when they arrive in Eagle Pass, which is struggling to meet the needs of its 28,000 residents, much less of those who make it across the border as well. The city has had to assign one of its five ambulances full time to transport injured migrants from the Rio Grande's edge. An estimated 300,000 migrants were apprehended along the southern border in December, a record, prompting the temporary closure of four international crossings, including the one in Eagle Pass. The Justice Department denounced the Governor's decision to close the entrances. Texas has long been at the center of American immigration policy, with some of the largest levels of arrivals in recent years occurring in El Paso and across the Rio Grande Valley. But the area has turned into a key point of friction this year between Republican leaders and the Biden administration. Edgar Sandoval, J. David Goodman and Lola Fadulu contributed reporting.

By Eileen Sullivan and Emiliano Rodriguez Mega, May 19, 2023, Reporting from Washington and Mexico City, New York Times https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/19/us/politics/8-year-old- migrant-died-border.html An 8-year-old girl who died while in U.S. border custody on Wednesday had been detained for a week--more than twice the amount of time the government generally aims to hold migrants, particularly children, according to two people familiar with the situation. The girl and her family were being held in a Customs and Border Protection facility in Harlingen, Texas, where they were waiting to be deported on a flight to Honduras. The family was among thousands of migrants who crossed the country's southern border ahead of the expiration of a pandemic-era immigration rule that the authorities had feared would lead to a large influx of migrants and overcrowding at border holding facilities. The people familiar with the situation spoke on the condition of anonymity because the child's death is under internal investigation. Honduras's foreign ministry identified the girl as Anadith Danay Reyes Alvarez, a Panamanian national known to her family as Ana, who was born with a heart condition. Her parents, who are Honduran, traveled to the United States so that their daughter could have ``a better life,'' said Antonio Garcia, the country's foreign vice minister. Customs and Border Protection officials said on Wednesday that emergency medical services had transported the girl to a hospital, where she died. Biden administration officials did not respond to additional questions about the circumstances surrounding the child's death, citing the internal review. A border official in Texas who was not authorized to speak publicly said that Ana had a serious medical condition of which officials had not immediately been aware. Though all migrants are given health screenings when taken into Federal custody, the death of a child is at the heart of concerns about the government's policy of detaining children for any period of time and particularly in crowded settings. While there is no law or official guidance about how long undocumented migrants are to be detained while in border custody, the government typically aims for about 3 days. In the past week the authorities have struggled with overcrowding at border facilities, which quickly exceeded capacity after a spike in illegal migration ahead of last week's lifting of the pandemic-era public health rule, known as Title 42. That policy had allowed officials to expel some migrants swiftly, instead of holding them in custody. Since its expiration, officials have reverted to policies that involve longer processing times for migrants. On May 17, the day Ana died, migrants were being held for an average of four-and-a-half days, according to internal data obtained by The New York Times, compared to an average of a little under 3 days on May 10. ``The bottom line is you need to get families out of C.B.P. custody because the conditions generally are substandard and not appropriate for kids to be held in,'' said Wendy Young, the president of the advocacy group Kids in Need of Defense. Scientific studies have concluded that detaining children, even if they are with their parents, can cause developmental and mental health issues. Brandon Judd, the leader of the Border Patrol labor union, said agents have raised concerns about the crowded detention centers. ``There's a reason that you have a certain capacity, and that's for the safety of everybody,'' Mr. Judd said. ``When you exceed that capacity, then safety levels are going to go way down.'' In 2018 and 2019, when the numbers of migrant crossings reached high levels, the Trump administration came under intense criticism for the death of minors in Customs and Border Protection detention. In an interview with Univision on May 18, Lorna Santos, Ana's aunt, said that the child's mother told officials at the Customs and Border Protection facility that Ana was having trouble breathing, but that a medical staff member dismissed her concerns. Ms. Santos said the girl's mother told her that Ana later fainted and was taken to a hospital, where she died in the waiting room. Wilson Paz, the director of Honduras's migrant protection service, said Ana's father told Honduran authorities that she had undergone surgery in Panama 3 years ago to address a membrane blocking blood from reaching her heart. Mr. Paz said she was tested for Covid-19 when she went to the United States, and she was diagnosed with the flu. The Biden administration has been managing a historic spike in illegal migration for the past two years, as people flee authoritarian states, violence and extreme poverty. Though the administration added more staff to help process migrants into the country and increased Customs and Border Protection's capacity to hold migrants before Title 42 expired, it was not enough to stave off the backups that led to overcrowding last week. In the week since the policy ended, however, the number of illegal crossings have been down significantly, with an average of 3,000 to 4,000 apprehensions a day, the Homeland Security Department said, compared to the nearly 10,000 apprehended a day around the time that Ana and her family crossed. The majority of the migrants have been from Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala. Since May 12, more than 11,000 migrants have been expelled to Mexico or repatriated, the department said in a statement on Friday. On May 10, Angel Eduardo Maradiaga Espinoza, a 17-year-old Honduran boy, died while he was in a Florida shelter overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services, the agency charged with overseeing the care of migrant children who cross into the United States without a parent or guardian. The boy's mother said he was epileptic but had not been sick when he traveled to the United States. Zolan Kanno-Youngs contributed reporting from Washington. Eileen Sullivan is a Washington correspondent covering the Department of Homeland Security. Previously, she worked at the Associated Press where she won a Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting. Mrs. Ramirez. Thank you. Anadith Reyes Alvarez, an 8-year- old who passed away on May 2023 at a CBP detention facility in Texas when medical staff failed to review her medical documentation and provide access to a physician and emergency care. There are so many examples of the consequences of a cold disregard for our shared humanity and the absence of compassion, there is just so much pain. It is across our communities, immigration statuses, political identities when it comes to the humanitarian crisis within our borders and the cost of Congressional inaction. You see, I just got back from Guatemala, where I heard painful stories that underline the need to act beyond our borders to address the root causes of migration. What causes a 9-, a 12-year-old to cross all of Guatemala, all of Mexico, in hope to get to our Southern Border? What do we do to create legal pathways and how do we understand the root causes of migration? I heard about children who are hungry, impoverished, desperate to meet the needs of their families, willing to leave villages, cross jungles, deserts, and rivers, and die in Rio Grande just to make it to the United States. I heard about the pain and trauma of separation, isolation, detention, and deportation. I saw how corruption, corporate land grabs, environmental destruction and disaster, Democratic backsliding, create conditions that drive migration. Pain that shows us where healing is needed. The pain that was shared with me in Guatemala requires healing that could be advanced by Congressional action, Congressional action that addresses and prepares for climate migration, invests in economic development of Latin American countries, modernizes legal pathways to citizenship, strengthens democracy, and combats corruption in Latin America. You see, the pain of Anadith's death requires healing that could be advanced by Congressional action, like establishing humanitarian standards at CBP sites, granting immigration parole, improving adjudicatory processing capacity, or increasing personnel to reduce USCIS backlogs. The pain of Virterma, Yorlei, and Jonathan's death requires healing that could be advanced by Congressional action. We could increase border personnel to expand screening and assistance to new arrivals. The pain of families trafficked by Abbott must be addressed by implementing Federal coordination or resettlement to interior cities, expanding work permits. To heal we have to actually talk about comprehensive immigration reform and have a conversation, why are thousands of people wanting to cross our Southern Border? Professor Pearlstein, the testimonies we heard today show how critical it is that we take policy action. Yes or no. Ms. Pearlstein. I think these policies are of enormous, pressing public importance. Yes. Mrs. Ramirez. Just for the record, for the 10th time maybe, if impeachments are not an instrument for effecting policy changes, is there a legitimate basis for this impeachment, yes or no? Ms. Pearlstein. I don't believe the Constitution supports impeachment in this case. Mrs. Ramirez. Thank you. You see, Republicans are not interested in advancing policy change. If they were, they would stop these impeachment hearings and work with us to pass legislation. Even one of the many things I talked about, sit down with us and actually work on it. But according to Speaker Johnson, Congress can't solve border until Trump is elected or a Republican is back in the White House. I mean, think about how politicized this moment is. They are parading our parade for their political purposes. Enough. As I said, if we are serious about this process and this solution, we would be capable to respect people's humanity and move us to a collaborative approach where our neighboring countries were able to address the root cause, keep communities safe, and honor the very fabric of our multiracial multicultural democracy. That is what we would be doing today. Thank you, Chairman and Ranking Member. I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentlelady yields. I now recognize Mr. D'Esposito, the gentleman from New York, for his 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the witnesses this morning. It seems that the other side of the aisle is talking about making this impeachment about politics. I will tell you that this has absolutely nothing to do with politics and everything to do with the American people. Ms. Pearlstein, you mentioned in the recording that our Chairman played that the Founding Fathers talked, and what they described in the Constitution is not what we focus on right now always. You, quote, said, ``Serious offenses against the public trust could lead to an impeachment.'' So, Mrs. Dunn, do you believe that what has occurred and what happened to your daughter and other teenagers and Americans throughout this country just like her, do you believe that that is a serious offense against the public trust? Mrs. Dunn. Yes. My border not being secure is a serious offense. Other legislators, worried about other people from other countries instead of my own is a serious offense. I take great offense to that. I think you need to be worried about us. Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you. Ms. Nobles, the same question. Do you feel that what happened to your daughter and the crimes that have been committed against Americans by individuals who have illegally crossed our border, do you think that those are serious offenses against the public trust? Ms. Nobles. Yes, definitely. Mr. D'Esposito. So Secretary Mayorkas and his failed border policies have placed all Americans in danger. Every State is a border State, and every State has seen the impact of the crisis at our Southern Border. It is what we have outlined over the five phases in this committee. Proud to be a retired NYPD detective, having spent a career upholding my oath to protect and serve the places that I kept safe. That solemn oath is now that much harder for law enforcement throughout this country, have been put on the front lines of this crisis as a direct result of the failed policies of Secretary Mayorkas. As I just stated, every State is a border State. Ms. Nobles, your daughter was tragically murdered in Maryland, well over 1,000 miles from the Southern Border. I know that the man who murdered your daughter was a well-known MS-13 gang member. In 2018, President Trump came to Long Island with then- Congressman Peter King to discuss MS-13 and the heinous crimes they commit both on Long Island and throughout this country. You see, back then, we had an administration who actively worked to find solutions to the issues occurring at our Southern Border. They worked with law enforcement to make sure that they had the tools necessary to protect and serve their communities. Now we have Secretary Mayorkas, who has put all Americans in danger. In Nassau County, we have identified 271 MS-13 members. Ms. Nobles, do you believe that Secretary Mayorkas has taken adequate measures to ensure MS-13 members and other members of criminal organizations are not able to enter this Nation illegally? Ms. Nobles. No. Absolutely not. Mr. D'Esposito. Ms. Dunn, just this morning, I spoke with Commissioner Pat Ryder, who is the commissioner of the Nassau County Police Department. My district, well over thousands of miles from the Southern Border, is still seeing dozens of overdoses each week with drugs flowing from our Southern Border. We know that it takes an incredibly small amount of fentanyl to kill someone and harm families and communities. Do you know the amount of fentanyl that killed your daughter? Mrs. Dunn. Sir, my daughter used one-half of one tablet that she believed was Percocet. In that one-half of one tablet, there was 5 milligrams of fentanyl, enough to kill 2\1/2\ people. Mr. D'Esposito. Two-and-a-half people? Mrs. Dunn. Correct. Mr. D'Esposito. In 5 milligrams? Mrs. Dunn. Yes. Mr. D'Esposito. Since Mayorkas has been the Secretary of Homeland Security 25 billion milligrams of fentanyl has come across our Southern Border and, unfortunately, has killed many others, tragically, just like your daughter. Mrs. Dunn. Yes. Mr. D'Esposito. It is very clear that America and the people who live here are at risk. Secretary Mayorkas deserves to be impeached because he has committed serious offenses against the public trust of the United States of America. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentlemen yields. I now recognize the gentleman from New York, Mr. Goldman, for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Goldman. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I thank our witnesses for being here today. Ms. Nobles and Ms. Dunn, I just want to express my sincere condolences. I was a Federal prosecutor for 10 years who charged people for gang-related and drug trafficking crimes. Unfortunately, this is not the first time I have had to interact with families of victims, and my heart goes out to you. I want to apologize in some ways to you that you are here really to share your story, but you are being used as a fact witness for an impeachment investigation. Obviously, given, you know, what your experience has been, you don't have the background to understand what a high crime or misdemeanor is and how it relates to this. So I hope that you are handling that OK. You know, one of the things that the Chairman said at the beginning of his opening statement was that he wishes that Democrats would turn our sympathy into action. And quite ironically said, thoughts and prayers are not enough. At first, I thought we were at a gun violence hearing where we were talking about the repeated thoughts and prayers of the two mass shootings that happen every day. But I do want to just go through some of the actions, as the Chairman pointed out, turn sympathy into action. Because I assume, Ms. Dunn, you would agree, would you not, that it would help to stop the fentanyl trade and fentanyl trafficking from coming into this country if we had more law enforcement officers at the border and more resources and technology to stop the fentanyl from coming in? Do you agree with that? Mrs. Dunn. I disagree with that because Border Patrol is now being used to make sandwiches and to screen people and let them into our country. Mr. Goldman. OK. Well, so---- Mrs. Dunn. So I disagree with you. Mr. Goldman. So you are saying that you are upset because the Border Patrol is not doing--is making sandwiches, I think you said, so you don't think it would be helpful to have more Border Patrol officers who are charged with stopping the fentanyl trade? Mrs. Dunn. I would like the Border Patrol to be able to do the job that they were hired to do. Mr. Goldman. Well, one way--I am sorry. Mrs. Dunn. Every Border Patrol officer that I have spoken to has told me that their hands are tied by this administration and Mr. Mayorkas. I have been to the border, sir. Have you? Mr. Goldman. Excuse me, I am asking the questions. Mrs. Dunn. I'm just wondering. Mr. Goldman. The problem with that is that in Congress, this Congress, we have interviewed 9 senior officials under DHS in a variety of different capacities. Every single one of them has said that it would be helpful to provide more resources at the border to stop the flow of fentanyl coming in. That is actually exactly what President Biden has done. In last year's budget, fiscal year 2023, the appropriations, it included 300 additional U.S. Border Patrol agents, which was the first increase since 2011; included 125 more CBP officers; $70 million for nonintrusive inspection. Two hundred House Republicans, including every single Republican serving at the time who currently sits on this committee, voted against that bill. Under the Biden administration, the Department of Homeland Security has seized more fentanyl and arrested more criminals for fentanyl-related crimes in the last 2 years than in the previous 5 years combined. Even in this Congress, when we had the Department of Homeland Security appropriations markup, Mr. Correa offered an amendment that would provide more money and more resources for the border to stop the fentanyl trade, and every single Republican voted it down. But that is not it. Even with the supplemental request from the White House, they requested $1.2 billion to crack down on the trafficking of dangerous and lethal illicit drugs like fentanyl, including over $300 million for the most effective nonintrusive inspection systems. Of course, 90 percent of fentanyl comes through the ports of entry, so having those inspection systems would do it. Again, the Republicans will not support the border with additional resources to do the job that the Secretary wants to do. So we are here yet again for a political stunt to make an argument that this administration is not doing anything, even as it is negotiating to try to address the problems at the border, and even as it is trying to increase the number of border agents and technology to address the fentanyl system. Let's stop this sham impeachment hearing, and let's go negotiate with the Senate and the White House, who are doing that right now with Secretary Mayorkas, to address the problems at the border. I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Bishop, for his 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Dunn, I was watching you as we listened to my friend from New York just now and heard what you said. You did a fantastic job sort-of defeating his point in the little bit of time he gave you. But as he was saying that they make the issue that Republicans aren't sending more money to the border. What every jurisdiction in the United States, notably New York, Chicago, and others, are suffering is a deluge of immigrants that the country cannot assimilate. They are not prepared to be assimilated culturally, by linguistic background, by experience. We can't get the job done that way. The only proposals that Democrats have offered, let this go down on record, the only proposals that have been offered is to send more money to the border, which will be used to process more immigrants faster into the country, No. 1; or No. 2, to legalize them all, grant them amnesty, as if that would somehow address any of the problems that we are experiencing. Not one of them would be addressed. So I appreciate, Ms. Nobles, you, and Ms. Dunn, you, for being here. It must be particularly infuriating to hear that when you have suffered the ultimate victimhood from the violations of law that the Secretary of Homeland Security has administered. So, Professor Pearlstein, I want to go you, though, because I want to talk about that victim, the rule of law. You said in your paper in defense of Secretary Mayorkas that to the extent the majority of reports, allegations against the Secretary are related to those policies, in particular the suggestion that Secretary Mayorkas somehow exceeded the scope of his lawful authority to set priorities for the enforcement of U.S. immigration law, that claim has been rejected, most recently by an overwhelming bipartisan majority of the U.S. Supreme Court. Now, are you referring to the United States v. Texas case from last June? Ms. Pearlstein. I am. Mr. Bishop. But there the majority opinion says, ``We take no position on whether the Executive branch here is complying with its legal obligations. We hold only that the Federal Courts are not the proper forum to resolve this dispute.'' So when you read that language, how do you come to the conclusion that the Court decided that Secretary Majorkas is acting in accordance with his legal responsibilities? Ms. Pearlstein. The basis of the Court's ruling on standing that you just described was, as Justice Kavanaugh's opinion for the majority said, ``The authority to decide how to prioritize and how aggressively to pursue legal actions against defendants belongs to the Executive branch under Article II.'' That was the basis of the ruling that there is no standing in this case. In other words---- Mr. Bishop. Well, they also said they have taken no position whether the Executive branch is complying with its legal obligations. Ms. Pearlstein. The Justice that former President Trump---- Mr. Bishop. How is that? Ms. Pearlstein . Appointed said, this is authority that belongs exclusively to the Executive branch. Mr. Bishop. Right. What you are referring to is the Court says, we are not in the business of refereeing anything where the Executive has any amount of prosecutorial discretion. But they also say, we are not deciding here whether the Executive branch is complying with its legal obligations. Both of those propositions are true. They are both in the opinion, are they not, ma'am? Ms. Pearlstein. The Court found that there was no standing because---- Mr. Bishop. No, ma'am. I asked you a question. Ms. Pearlstein. The Court found---- Mr. Bishop. This proposition is in the opinion as well, correct? I read it. It is accurate. Ms. Pearlstein. The Court found there was no standing. That is also true. Mr. Bishop. I didn't ask you about standing. I asked you whether this language that I just read where the Court said, we are not determining whether the Executive branch is complying with its legal obligations, that is also in the Court's opinion, correct? Ms. Pearlstein. That may be in the Court's opinion, but what I said---- Mr. Bishop. That is what I asked. Thank you. Let me ask you this, at the oral argument, this was Justice Kavanaugh's question to the Solicitor General, Solicitor General of the United States, ``I think your position is instead of judicial review, Congress has to resort to shutting down the Government or impeachment or dramatic steps if some administration comes in and says, we're not going to enforce laws or at least not going to enforce the laws to the degree that Congress by law has said the laws should be enforced.'' That is forcing--I mean, I understand your position, but it is forcing Congress to take dramatic steps. Isn't that what he said at oral argument? Ms. Pearlstein. I don't have the transcript of oral argument. Mr. Bishop. All right. Do you disagree with his proposition as I just recited it to you? Ms. Pearlstein. Justice Alito said in his lone dissent that impeachment, along with funding cutoffs and others, were among the potentially available remedies that Congress has. The majority opinion, none of the other 8 Justices, including all of the Justices appointed by the former President, mentioned impeachment in that context. Mr. Bishop. So are you familiar with the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996? Ms. Pearlstein. It's a large act. Which part? Mr. Bishop. The part that the United States Supreme Court considered in United States v. Texas. Ms. Pearlstein. I've read the case. Mr. Bishop. OK. Do you know that as Justice Alito describes in the dissent, that in that situation, the Congress decided to withdraw some of the discretion that the Executive has by requiring detention and specifically in certain cases, right? Ms. Pearlstein. What the Court said was that for the last 27 years, since these laws--that law was enacted in their current form, all 5 Presidential administrations have determined the resource constraints necessitated prioritization in making immigration addresses. Mr. Bishop. If you evaded a question like that before the bench, they would not like it. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. My time has expired. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. Swalwell, for his 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Swalwell. Appreciate that. Thank you, Chairman. First, I want to thank Ms. Nobles and Mrs. Dunn for testifying and express my condolences for the loss of your children and to tell you that I have constituents as well who have lost children to fentanyl. I know it is not easy to come to Congress and to talk about it. I hope that what you will find one day is a Congress that will unite and do everything it can to make sure that we reduce these deaths. I also wish we could hear from Secretary Mayorkas because he has stated he wants to come and testify. I know Mr. Magaziner put into the record a letter from Mr. Mayorkas stating that he, again, would be willing to testify. He has testified 27 times to Congress, more than any other Cabinet official, and twice last year before this committee. He has made his senior officials available. To the witnesses who have come here today, if you came looking for an audience that is serious and wants, you know, to take up this issue, I am afraid you are in the wrong place. I am afraid that when it comes to immigration solutions, too many of my colleagues would rather have the issue than the fix. I am speaking for myself here, and I know I probably speak for many of my colleagues, I don't want open borders. I want a secure border. That is why I have supported surging more border agents at the border. That is why I support deploying more technologies at the border. That is why I support having more barriers at the border. That is why I want to make sure that we also address the workforce crisis in America by, you know, increasing legal immigration and increasing immigrants who can work the jobs that Americans are just not going to work, so we can reduce the costs and give more financial breathing room to families in this country. You are not going to find that here. This is not where they do that. This is where they seek fame rather than a fix. What you are going to find here is that if we were to solve this crisis, this committee wouldn't have anything to talk about. That is more important to the Speaker of this House, and that is more important to the person that too many of them rely upon when they make decisions, which is the former President. I want to just give you a couple of examples. Sergeant Dannels, I am sorry he can't be here today because last time he was here, I asked him if he would support additional Border Patrol agents as the Senate passed with 68 Republicans and Democrats not too long ago, and he said he would. I would like to have unanimous consent to enter into the record his written testimony to our committee and to the Oversight Committee where he said that. Ms. Lee . Without objection, so ordered.   Mr. Swalwell. So then you have, just recently on CNN, Jake Tapper asked Speaker Johnson, look, President Biden wants to give you more money at the border. Would you take that? Speaker Johnson said no. Again, just revealing and saying out loud what we all know, which is that they don't want to solve this problem. They want to use it and exploit it and exploit victims so they have a political narrative. Senate negotiations are taking place right now where, in good faith, Democrats and Republicans are working to try and find more solutions and more resources at the border. That is dead on arrival here, where Republican colleagues have said out loud, we are never going to support that, that would help the President. They have actually said that. My Democratic colleagues want the fix. MAGA Republicans want the fiction. My Democratic colleagues want the fix. My MAGA colleagues want FOX. My Democratic colleagues want the fix. My MAGA colleagues want the fame. That is what this is entirely about. If you have any questions as to whether that is what this is about, one of the questions earlier was asking a professor who came here to talk about immigration in the Constitution whether she would condemn Hamas' attack on October 7. Everyone here condemns Hamas' attack on October 7. But if that same Member was asked, would you condemn Donald Trump's role in the January 6 insurrection or would you condemn the people on this committee who call the January 6 terrorists hostages, an insult to the actual hostages, American hostages in Gaza right now, he would take a pass. He wouldn't want to answer the question. They couldn't answer the question because they won't condemn it. They don't want the fix. They want the fiction. If they were not willing to hold Donald Trump accountable for his impeachable crimes, I don't really want their hot take---- Ms. Lee. The gentleman's time has expired. The gentleman---- Mr. Swalwell. I don't want their hot take on Secretary Mayorkas. Ms. Lee . Is recognized---- Mr. Swalwell. I yield back. Ms. Lee . For 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Garbarino. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Nobles, Ms. Dunn, I am very sorry for your losses. I don't have children. I couldn't imagine what you have gone through. But, Ms. Nobles, I want to start with you. The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services have systems in place to ensure that unaccompanied alien children from noncontiguous countries are transferred from Customs and Border Protection to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, ORR. The House Judiciary report regarding your daughter's murder notes that ORR lost track of more than 85,000 children and placed fewer than 15,000 follow-up calls after discharging an additional 32,000 children. At no point did anyone from CBP or HHS flag this violent criminal who had a criminal gang history, along with multiple MS-13 tattoos. Ms. Nobles, does this sound like a well-run system meant to protect American people? Ms. Nobles. No. Her murderer was apprehended at the border on March 2022. They had him. They did not check. They didn't check for his background check. They let him go to an unknown sponsor, don't even know who the sponsor is, and she takes him to Frederick, Maryland, from Texas to Maryland. Then he ended up in the same trailer as my daughter. Mr. Garbarino. As you said, as it turns out, the murderer was a known gang member, was a 16-year-old known gang member affiliated with MS-13 in El Salvador. Since the current administration's open border policy began, we have seen a sharp increase in the number of known criminals crossing our Southern Border. That has included members of MS-13, whose motto is kill, rape, and control. My district on Long Island has suffered from high levels of gang activity, especially MS-13, for years. It stopped, actually, when the former President increased--when he increased FBI and cooperation and police protection on Long Island. So we were actually winning the battle for a while. But unfortunately, that is starting to change again. You know, just this summer, a member of MS-13 pled guilty to the murder, on Long Island, pled guilty to the murder of two teenage girls who were attacked with baseball bats and machetes. This is just one of the many examples. Do you think border security and proper alien vetting is a national security issue? Ms. Nobles. Yes. Supposedly he is 16. We don't know his real age. Mr. Garbarino. Exactly. Ms. Nobles. But they're treating him as a juvenile, but. Mr. Garbarino. Well, that is actually, I will share, for the UACs, one of the times I went to the border, because I have been several times, CBP was saying that when they were processing people who were trying to be under--trying to show that they are under 18, they actually found real documentation showing they were between the ages of 25 and 30. So we don't know exactly how old he is, like you said. Ms. Nobles. No. Mr. Garbarino. This committee has been focused on Biden administration's refusal to secure our Southwest Border and vet alien arrivals. A report from the House Judiciary Committee, like I said--like I mentioned before, pointed out multiple vetting failures with your daughter's killer. Its report shows that your daughter's murderer was arrested for association with MS-13 well before he came to the United States, something that the U.S. officials verified easily after the murder. Unfortunately, it was after. Like you said, the report also noted that the alien was released after he was arrested for murder. Do you think Secretary Mayorkas has done an adequate job vetting illegal aliens coming across our border? Ms. Nobles. No. Because if he was vetted, he would have never been allowed in. He would have never been allowed to come here and commit that horrific crime on my daughter. Mr. Garbarino. Thank you for your answers. Again, I am very sorry for your loss. Ms. Nobles. Thank you. I'm not yelling at you. I'm sorry. Mr. Garbarino. No. Ms. Nobles. Wow. Mr. Garbarino. It is OK. I am from New York. Sometimes our tone gets---- Ms. Nobles. Oh, OK. Mr. Garbarino. We get I am not yelling. This is just how I talk. Ms. Nobles. Well, no, I was telling you that I wasn't yelling at you. Mr. Garbarino. No. Ms. Nobles. I was just, you know. Mr. Garbarino. Ms. Dunn, quickly, the United States is in a fentanyl crisis. We all know that. It is being inflamed by the open Southwest Border. Illicit narcotics have resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths in just the past few years. Fentanyl is highly addictive, incredibly potent, and easy to make, which is why it is a favorite drug for the cartels and drug traffickers. I am sure you have answered this already today multiple times, but I think it is worth getting it on the record multiple times. Do you believe that Secretary Mayorkas' open borders have exacerbated the fentanyl epidemic? Mrs. Dunn. Yes, I believe so. Mr. Garbarino. Do you believe that Secretary Mayorkas is doing enough to fight the scourge of fentanyl? Mrs. Dunn. Not at all, no. Mr. Garbarino. Why not? Mrs. Dunn. He needs to lock down that border. Everyone keeps saying, give them more money. Those poor Border Patrol agents are now the welcoming committee. They are ordered to be the welcoming committee. They don't want to be the welcoming committee. They are told to do that by Mayorkas, by this administration. Just like the young lady next to you had said, it is either Mayorkas or the Biden administration. Somebody is telling the poor Border Patrol to not do their job. No matter how much money you give them, they are still not going to be allowed to do their job. Ms. Lee. The gentlemen's time has expired. Mr. Garbarino. Thank you. Ms. Lee. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Garcia. Thank you very much. Thank you to our witnesses. I want to just get back to why we are here. This is, of course, another effort and this hearing is really about demonizing migrants and, again, smearing Secretary Mayorkas. Professor Pearlstein, thank you for being here. Are there any grounds, again, for impeaching Secretary Mayorkas under the Constitution? Ms. Pearlstein. I don't believe the Constitution supports impeachment in this case. Mr. Garcia. Thank you. As far as I am concerned, that is the most important question and really gets to the heart of why we are here today. We talked a lot about the fentanyl crisis and fentanyl in this committee and today. But the fentanyl crisis, we know is a tragedy, but we also think it is important to remember who didn't end the fentanyl crisis. That was actually Donald Trump. Mr. Chairman, I asked unanimous consent to introduce this article titled, ``Synthetic opioid overdose: Deaths soared while Trump was President.''** I also would like to enter to the record this other article, ``Opioid crisis: Critics say Trump fumbled response to another deadly epidemic.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- *** The information was previously submitted in this document by Hon. Carter. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  Submitted For the Record by Honorable Garcia opioid crisis: critics say trump fumbled response to another deadly epidemic October 29, 2020 5:01 AM ET, Heard On All Things Considered When then-Presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke in Manchester, N.H., a week before the 2016 election, he said the opioid crisis was destroying lives and shattering families. ``We are going to stop the inflow of drugs into New Hampshire and into our country 100 percent,'' Trump promised. It was a major campaign issue. Overdoses were surging in battleground states key to the election, like New Hampshire, Ohio and Pennsylvania. In 2017--Trump's first year in office--more than 42,000 Americans died from overdoses linked to heroin, fentanyl and prescription opioids, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Before coronavirus hit, opioids were widely viewed as the nation's top public health crisis. Trump declared a public health emergency in October 2017, noting that overdoses had joined gun violence and car crashes as a leading cause of death in America. ``No part of our society, not young or old, rich or poor, urban or rule has been spared this plague,'' he said. Significant accomplishments followed. Trump signed legislation in 2018 that boosted Federal funding for drug treatment. During trade talks with China last year, Trump pushed to slow that country's exports of fentanyl. ``The Federal Government has taken some important steps to increase access to evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder,'' said Beau Kilmer, who heads the Rand Corporation's Drug Policy Research Center. Kilmer also credits Trump for ``pressuring China to better regulate some of its synthetic opioids.'' A public health emergency, but no clear leadership But while some progress was made, critics point to serious missteps behind the scenes that hampered Federal efforts, including the decision to sideline and defund the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). An internal memo acquired by NPR in 2017 found the White House was contemplating a 94 percent cut in resources to the agency, tasked since 1988 with developing and coordinating the nation's drug addiction efforts. That decision was later reversed but Trump handed leadership of the opioid response to a series of political appointees, including former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and White House adviser Kellyanne Conway. ``This made it difficult for people to understand, you know, who's leading and coordinating the effort on opioids,'' Kilmer said. Still, there seemed to be some success, with opioid deaths dipping slightly in 2018. ``This sign of progress is an example of what can happen when an administration prioritizes an issue,'' said ONDCP director Jim Carroll in a statement earlier this year. But in 2019, the number of overdoses surged again to a new record with more than 50,000 opioid-related fatalities. The CDC's preliminary data shows another big increase in deaths during the first 4 months of 2020. U.S. went 2 years without a national strategy Researchers also say fentanyl has continued to spread fast, despite interdiction efforts, contributing to more overdose deaths in the western United States where the synthetic opioid had been scarce. In December, the Government Accountability Office issued a report blasting the administration for failing to come up with a coherent national opioid strategy as required by law. ``ONDCP did not issue a national drug control strategy for either 2017 or 2018,'' the GAO concluded. The ONDCP declined an interview request for this story, but a spokesman told NPR in an email that the agency has addressed the GAO's concerns and is once again functioning in full compliance. ``ONDCP has released several documents that together address all of the statutory requirements that GAO noted as missing,'' the spokesman said. But in recent months, even some members of the Trump administration have begun voicing alarm. ``Basically everything is pointed in the wrong direction,'' said Adm. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health and an opioid policy expert at the Department of Health and Human Services. During a panel discussion in late July, Giroir described recent increases in opioid overdoses as ``a nightmare,'' adding that ``all the progress that we made has been reversed and this is even before the pandemic.'' Trump attack on Affordable Care Act threatens opioid response Drug policy experts say things could grow even worse in the months ahead if Trump is successful in dismantling the Affordable Care Act. The program created during the Obama Administration subsidizes State Medicaid programs that provide insurance coverage for roughly 40 percent of Americans receiving opioid addiction treatment. ``We've seen very large increases in the number of individuals going to treatment programs,'' said Brendan Saloner, a researcher at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. If the Supreme Court strikes down the ACA, as Trump has urged, those gains in insurance coverage and care would likely be reversed. ``The situation is bleak and it could be a lot bleaker,'' Saloner said. Meanwhile, Democrat Joe Biden has released a plan of his own promising to end the overdose crisis if he's elected. His No. 1 policy idea? Preserve and expand the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Garcia. I bring these documents up because I think it is really important to note that during Trump's presidency, the fentanyl crisis had already been a huge challenge across this country. In fact, Trump said before the 2016 election, he said the opioid crisis was destroying lives and shattering families. He said, ``We are going to stop the inflow of drugs into New Hampshire and into our country 100 percent.'' One hundred percent, Trump promised. In 2017, Trump's first year in office, more than 42,000 Americans died from overdoses linked to heroin, fentanyl, and prescription opioids. There was a huge fentanyl problem when Donald Trump was President. The administration didn't even bother to issue a National strategy on fentanyl in his first 2 years in office. So I think it is crazy that the Majority is trying to turn this into a public health crisis that's somehow new or began during the Biden administration. Unfortunately, this is about much larger issues that we have, because our conversation today isn't about the Constitution or the law. It is not even about securing the border. The Majority is not interested in solutions. Donald Trump, as always, has said the quiet part out loud when he said immigrants, and I quote, ``are poisoning the blood of our country.'' As we know, this is rhetoric that can be compared to Hitler and the kind of rhetoric that he used. Extremists here in Congress also continue to push issues like the Great Replacement Theory. We should be clear, immigrants are some of the most patriotic and hardworking people there are in this country. I just heard a committee Member say, and I quote, ``They are not prepared to be assimilated,'' talking about immigrants. I am an immigrant. I think I am pretty well-assimilated here. I am a Member of Congress. So I think it is very un-American to attack and demonize migrants the way that some in this Majority continue to do. Immigrants aren't here to poison or victimize the American people. I also want to just touch on this issue of crime. Some in the Majority continue to talk about crime, and crime is a horrific tragedy. Clearly, I feel horrible for our witnesses that are here that have lost members of their family. But let's look at real data as well. Both undocumented and documented immigrants are much less likely to commit crimes or be incarcerated than native-born American citizens. Our border communities are often safer from violent crimes than many interior cities. According to FBI crime data, crime in border communities was measured to actually be 15 percent lower than the national average. So from a crime perspective, more crime is being committed by American citizens than those folks that are undocumented or that are immigrants. Democrats also want an orderly and secure border. We want real solutions to the fentanyl crisis. But we need to understand the problems we are trying to solve. We need solutions, legislation, not impeachments of the Secretary and certainly not impeachments of President Biden. The idea that any of these problems will be solved by the border alone, I think, is also crazy. These problems have existed for decades. We haven't had immigration reform or any sort of policy in over 30 years. Without legal pathways, we won't never have an orderly border. That is also a fact. We can't have a conversation with a Presidential candidate, a former President, who thinks immigrants are poisoning the blood of our Nation, who thinks that we should build a moat with alligators along the border, who thinks that we should put spikes on the wall that he is trying to build, who has said that we should shoot migrants in the legs as they are crossing the border, who thinks we should send missiles into northern Mexico. These are the ideas being offered by the likely nominee of the Republican Party and by many on this committee and in the Republican majority. We need to have real solutions. We don't need Donald Trump's horrific policies to come back to this country, and we certainly shouldn't be impeaching Secretary Mayorkas. With that, I yield back. Ms. Lee. I now recognize myself for 5 minutes. For months now we have been hearing the staggering statistics about the catastrophe at our Southern Border, the millions of migrants coming across our border illegally, the human trafficking, the fentanyl, the lost unaccompanied minors. But today we hear something that is even more important than that. Today we hear the real personal stories of unfathomable loss and irreplaceable lives. Yet, even in the face of this testimony that we have heard today and the testimony that came before it, our colleagues across the aisle impugn the purpose and the necessity of this hearing, calling it a political sham, calling it a stunt, calling it theater. They suggest that what we actually need to do is pass more laws. So, as a former Federal prosecutor and judge, I will start today with a refresher on a few of the things that are currently illegal in the United States of America. It is illegal to traffic fentanyl in the United States of America. Human trafficking is illegal in this country. Theft is illegal in this country. Rape and murder are illegal in this country. What is more, the Department of Homeland Security has an absolute obligation to detain and remove those who enter this country illegally. We do not need more laws. We need a President of the United States and a Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security who enforce the laws of this country. But what do we have instead? An administration that has deliberately subverted the duly-enacted laws of the United States of America, that have deliberately defied the orders of courts in this United States of America, who have ordered and directed that they desist these unlawful policies. We have the Department of Homeland Security that has defied inquiries from the U.S. Congress. As for the 27 appearances of Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in front of this Congress, not one of those times did he admit that we have lost operational control of our border, that we have ceded control of our border to the Mexican drug cartels, or acknowledge the scope, scale, and crisis that our communities all across America face as a consequence, as a direct consequence, of these lawless policies. Every single time an individual is allowed to enter this country unlawfully, Americans are less safe. Ms. Nobles, Mrs. Dunn, as a mother, I see my child and my family in those photos that you shared with us today, and it is truly something that we cannot fathom the loss that you have each suffered. I thank you for your willingness to come here today and share with us your stories. I would like to hear your perspective, please, on what more Congress could be doing to support you and to try to prevent this type of unspeakable tragedy from happening in the lives of another family. We will start with you, Ms. Nobles. Ms. Nobles. I would like to see every illegal immigrant who wants to come here to be properly vetted and background- checked. I hear a lot about more funding, resources, and all that. How is that going to help them do their job in the first place? They failed Kayla by not checking her murderer's background and did not make that one phone call. One. One phone call could have saved my baby's life. They didn't. After he was arrested, they put him--some Child Protective Services took him and put him in an unsecured children's home with other children. I know Americans commit crimes on other Americans, but why do we have to take other countries' trash? Why do we need them? Ms. Lee. Ms. Dunn. Mrs. Dunn. We talked about a lot today about more resources at the border. I appreciate that and I respect that. But I don't think that Members in this room and other rooms at the Capitol understand that we are actually at war. We are at war with the cartels. We are losing our children. We are losing a generation of children. We are at war. We need our military at the border. That is what we need. We don't need more Border Patrol. We need our military at the border stopping the drugs, stopping people from coming in. They can't come in. We are full. We are closed. That is it. No more money. No more. No more sandwiches. It is closed. I am sorry. Come through the proper channels. I am a first-generation American. My parents both migrated here. Guess what. They did it legally. Ms. Lee. Thank you, Mrs. Dunn. My time has expired. I now recognize the gentleman from New Jersey for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Menendez. Thank you. Thank you to the witnesses for appearing here today. I appreciate you sharing your stories, and I am sorry for your immeasurable grief. The folks on this committee look forward to working together in a way where we can solve some of the challenges that are facing our country. But since this is an impeachment hearing, I will direct my questions to Professor Pearlstein. As the professor has observed, there are provisions of the Constitution that are murky and subject to debate and provisions that are clear. Article II, section 4, is clear. Treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors are the only Constitutionally-permissible grounds for impeachment. My Republican colleagues have not come close to making a Constitutionally-sound case for impeachment against Secretary Mayorkas. They have incorrectly argued that the Secretary's designations of certain groups as eligible for parole constitutes ``mass parole and is inconsistent with law.'' Each case is considered on a discretionary case-by-case basis, which is a requirement in the Immigration and Nationality Act. It is worth noting that parole authority has been used by every administration since President Eisenhower, who paroled 30,000 Hungarian nationals fleeing communism. Professor Pearlstein, does the Secretary's exercise of well-established parole authority constitute treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors? Ms. Pearlstein. I don't believe it does, no. Mr. Menendez. Thank you. My Republican colleagues have also argued that Secretary Mayorkas is violating the law by releasing migrants awaiting adjudication of their asylum claims. That claim is not true and that practice is not new. In fact, DHS released hundreds of thousands of individuals at the U.S.-Mexico border under President Trump. Professor Perlstein, does detaining migrants in a matter consistent with the law and the resources provided by this Congress, constitute treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors? Ms. Pearlstein. No, it doesn't. Mr. Menendez. Finally, my Republican colleagues have also incorrectly criticized the Secretary's guidelines for the enforcement of civil immigration law, which prioritize enforcement actions based on National security, public safety, and border security. But as Justice Kavanaugh observed in United States v. Texas, Article II of the Constitution confers upon the Executive branch the ``authority to decide how to prioritize and how aggressively to pursue legal actions against defendants who violate the law.'' That principle extends to the immigration context. Professor Pearlstein, does exercising well-established authority to prioritize immigration enforcement actions constitute treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors? Ms. Pearlstein. No, sir. Mr. Menendez. Thank you. This committee has engaged in months of so-called investigations into the administration's border security policies. Despite all the time and resources committee Republicans have invested, they still cannot make a case for impeaching the Secretary that meets Constitutional muster. Instead of wasting more time on a baseless impeachment, we should get back to the work of passing bills that will actually help solve problems. But Republicans don't seem interested in that. They made their immigration proposal, H.R. 2, as cruel and unworkable as possible, rejecting every amendment Democrats on this committee offered in good faith, amendments some Republicans agreed would improve the bill. Everyone on this committee wants to fight the scourge of fentanyl in this country. That is why during our markup of H.R. 2, I offered an amendment to authorize the Biden administration's Operation Blue Lotus, an aggressive strategy for fighting drug trafficking with a proven record of stopping fentanyl from being smuggled into the country. But every one of my Republican colleagues voted against it. Why? Because while they talk the talk, they refuse to walk the walk. H.R. 2, you talk about it in every response. What is your alternative to H.R. 2? Why does it have to be H.R. 2 or nothing? If you are serious about figuring out the border, work with us. Let's come up with another solution. But you go back to H.R. 2 every time you are challenged about the substance of what we are doing here while you are in the Majority on the border. Come up with a second proposal or a third proposal that can pass this House, be signed into law, and we can get to work. You sit on H.R. 2, you point to H.R. 2 and say, that is the work we have done. Meanwhile, you bring these witnesses here to talk about the tragedies they have experienced. But what are we doing now? What is your proposal now besides H.R. 2? There is nothing. There is nothing. This is about scoring political points. You want to make this administration look weak on the border. When are we going to put our country above party again? I believe in you guys. I believe you want to do that. Let's do it. But talking about H.R. 2 as a solution is a farce. One day, I do hope that we can work together on these issues. I would love to do that, because the work of this country is critical, and we need to get to it. With that, I yield back. Ms. Lee. I now recognize the gentleman from New York for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. LaLota. I appreciate my colleague from New Jersey's comments. I do believe he is operating in good faith, but I just think he is wrong. While there is squabbles between Members of both parties in this committee, the Executive branch has every power in its toolbox to get this done right away. It can reinstate Remain in Mexico. It can stop the repositioning of border agents away from the border and toward micro processing centers. It can do things on its own through executive action to clean up this mess. H.R. 2 is our response to that. That would require the administration to do those things to protect Americans. Madam Chairman, we spent 13 months in this committee laying out the case that our border is not secure and Americans are with us on this. Sixty-seven percent of Americans think the President is failing in his duty to secure the border. Much of our case in the last 13 months has been backed up by data, some pretty big numbers. Millions of migrants unlawfully mass-paroled into the United States, hundreds of thousands of gotaways, and tens of thousands of fentanyl deaths. But today, it is not about the data. Before us today are two actual victims of Secretary Mayorkas' open border, a mother whose daughter was sexually assaulted and murdered by an MS-13 member and another member whose daughter was fatally poisoned by fentanyl. Ms. Dunn and Ms. Nobles, as a father of 3 young girls for whom I would do and give anything, I can literally not imagine what you are going through. I appreciate you being here today, ripping off some of the scabs of the wound that has been caused and telling us your story so that we could be more informed and help solve this problem. Appreciate you being here today. Madam Chairman, if we had a more secure border, these horrific tragedies could have been avoided. If Secretary Mayorkas stopped paroling mass groups of migrants into the United States these tragedies could have been avoided. If Secretary Mayorkas stopped repositioning border agents away from the border just to sit behind a desk to process more and more unvetted migrants into the United States we would have less grieving mothers. Madam Chairman, the Biden administration has often falsely claimed that 90 percent of all fentanyl comes through ports of entry. I actually have a video of Secretary Mayorkas claiming that, and if we could play that, please.  Mr. LaLota. The Secretary is wrong and he is smart enough to know that he is wrong. Ninety percent only accounts for what is seized and not what actually makes it across the borders. Only the cartels, probably, who are profiting millions, tens of millions a month, know how much fentanyl is actually making across the borders. In fact, Border Patrol officials have told this committee they believe that only 5 to 10 percent of fentanyl is actually seized. The fact there are more than 70,000 deaths in our country in 2022 from fentanyl should be a telltale sign that fentanyl is flooding into this country, not only through ports of entry, but in between ports of entry as well. Ms. Dunn, do you think that pulling Border Patrol agents away from the border just to have them sit behind a desk to mass process more and more migrants into the country is a wise decision? Mrs. Dunn. No. Mr. LaLota. Do you think that that decision leads to more opportunities for the cartels to traffic fentanyl into this country? Mrs. Dunn. Yes. Mr. LaLota. Thank you. What impact, and I know you have the most personal of experience, but what impact do you think that fentanyl has had on the public health of the United States? Mrs. Dunn. Well, the most obvious one that I can see is I have a grandson that doesn't have a mother. He has other family that is able to raise him. But we haven't even begin to talk about the foster care system and how many children have lost their parents, little babies under 18 that are now wards of the States. Where's all that money coming from? Let's think about the traumas and sadness and what it's like to not have parents because their parents died from fentanyl. Mr. LaLota. Ms. Dunn, the Secretary knows your story, and he knows of other stories like yours, and he hasn't changed his policies. He hasn't insisted those border agents stay on the border. He hasn't canceled the mass parole of migrants to the United States. What could you say with respect to the Secretary's likely approach and his care for situations like yours, given that he hasn't changed his policies? Mrs. Dunn. It's very difficult for me to contain what I would say. Mr. LaLota. I appreciate that. Mrs. Dunn. I'd rather not say what I would like to say. Mr. LaLota. You are a classy person, and I appreciate you being here before us today. I yield. Chairman Green. The gentlemen yields. I now recognize Ms. Clarke from New York for her 5 minutes of questioning. Ms. Clarke. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank our Ranking Member. Good afternoon. Thank you to our witnesses for appearing here today. To our bereaved mothers, you have my deepest condolences. Earlier today, my colleagues discussed Republican opposition to providing CBP much-needed resources in the fiscal year 2023 funding bill. But that isn't the only time Republicans have opposed resources to secure our border. In October, President Biden sent Congress a supplemental funding request for fiscal year 2024, which included an additional $13.6 billion for border security. It would provide an additional 1,300 Border Patrol agents to work alongside the 20,200 agents already funded by the requested fiscal year 2024 budget, 375 immigration judges, teams to strengthen the immigration court system, 1,600 asylum officers to speed up processing of asylum claims, 1,000 CBP officers with a focus on countering fentanyl, new detection technology for ports of entry, more immigration detention beds, additional investigative capabilities to combat fentanyl trafficking, and $600 million more in grants to help communities receiving migrants, among other investments. As Secretary Mayorkas and bipartisan members of the Senate are in negotiations to get these much-needed resources enacted, House Republicans are just absent. Instead, they are focused on impeaching Secretary Mayorkas. Professor Pearlstein, do impeachment resolutions change policy? Ms. Pearlstein. No, ma'am. Ms. Clarke. Do they provide resources or authorize funding? Ms. Pearlstein. No, ma'am. Ms. Clarke. Even if House Republicans' attempt to impeach Secretary Mayorkas is successful, the Senate would have to convict, isn't that correct? Ms. Pearlstein. Yes, that's true. Ms. Clarke. How many Senators are required to convict the Secretary? Ms. Pearlstein. Conviction requires two-thirds of the Senate. Ms. Clarke. After a conviction, what happens next? Ms. Pearlstein. The person would be removed from office and the President has the opportunity to appoint someone new. Ms. Clarke. The Secretary would be removed and for a period of time, pending confirmation of a new Secretary, another official would serve as Acting Secretary, is that correct? Ms. Pearlstein. That's correct. Ms. Clarke. Would that individual be obligated to execute the administration's policies? Ms. Pearlstein. Yes, he serves at the pleasure of the President. Ms. Clarke. So, functionally, nothing would change? Ms. Pearlstein. That's correct. Ms. Clarke. If, instead, House Republicans decided to negotiate and pass the President's supplemental appropriations, what effect would that have on resources and policy? Ms. Pearlstein. Congress could pass laws today that have enormous effect not just on the availability of resources, but how those resources are allocated. So if Congress is unhappy with, for example, where officers are placed, Congress can impose conditions on existing funds that require the President to do something different. If they believe that the President or the Secretary is not complying with those laws, they can challenge them in court. That's exactly the process that's been playing out in recent years. Ms. Clarke. Very well. Mr. Chairman, Republicans have a choice. They can continue to pursue this sham impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas, which will change nothing, and, in fact, could slow down efforts to address challenges at the Southwest Border or they can work with the White House and bipartisan members of the Senate on legislation to improve border security and reduce drug trafficking. I urge my colleagues to get back to work for the American people. With that, I thank you, and I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentlelady yields. I now recognize Mr. Strong for his 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Strong. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Nobles, my heart goes out to you for the loss to your daughter. Thank you for being here with us today and for sharing her story. As you have been told, this committee today, the man that took Kayla's life, was in this country illegally. He was originally from El Salvador, where he was a known member of the MS-13 gang, a fact which was later easily verified both by his gang tattoos and by a simple call to the El Salvador government. Ms. Nobles, does it concern you that Secretary Mayorkas has not made any significant changes to his border policies, especially ones that make it easier for illegal aliens to enter and continually be released into our country without proper vetting? Ms. Nobles. Yes, very concerning, because I don't want this to happen to someone else's daughter or child. Mr. Strong. Thank you. In August 2023, there was an individual arrested in Alabama whose background is stunningly similar to Kayla's murderer. He was an El Salvador illegal here in the United States. He was also a member of the MS-13 and on El Salvador's top 100 Most Wanted list. He earned a spot on this list for aggravated kidnapping, attempted aggravated homicide, aggravated homicide, aggravated extortion, and terrorist organization. He was previously deported, yet Mayorkas opened the border and was able to make it back into this country. You start looking at this, Ms. Noble, this illustrates what we both know to be true. These are, unfortunately, not isolated events. As a matter of fact, from fiscal year 2021 to date, Border Patrol has recorded 41,162 arrests of illegal aliens with criminal backgrounds, approximately 88 percent higher than the combined previous fiscal years, the 4 years combined. Ms. Nobles, shouldn't just one instance that an illegal alien has endangered or taken the life of an innocent American like your daughter be a wake-up call to Secretary Mayorkas and President Biden? Ms. Nobles. Yes, most definitely. Mr. Strong. As a Member just said, there are no experts to raise their hands and say Mayorkas should be impeached. Ms. Nobles and Ms. Dunn, let me get one thing straight. You are experts. You lost it all. As a matter of fact, it has been more than just one instance. In Alabama alone, May 2023, an illegal alien from Honduras raped a teenage girl in a restaurant bathroom. November 2022, an illegal alien sodomized a 13-year-old boy. July 2022, an illegal immigrant from Mexico killed and dismembered a woman's body and her child. The lone survivor, a 12-year-old girl, escaped after watching this horrific scene and being held captive with the decomposing remains. How many more stories like this will it take for Secretary Mayorkas and the Biden administration to wake up? The Stay in Mexico Act, it worked. The Stay in Mexico Act, it worked. I don't care which President was there, whether it was Obama, whether it was Trump. The Stay in Mexico Act worked. Process them, fuel up ICE Air, send them back to the country of their origin. If not this, then what will compel them to act? I agree, Secretary Mayorkas is not the solution. He is part of the problem. He created this circus. He has failed to carry out United States law; 8.5 million illegals have crossed the Southern Border from 160 company countries. They have come into our country. They are invading our country from 160 countries. Fentanyl crossing the border by planes, mules, drones. Child slavery is rampant, and both sides of the aisle know it. Eighty-five thousand children illegally brought into America, and this administration says we have no clue where they are. No clue where they are. Guess what. They are in sex slavery in our country. Let me answer the facts. But I am telling you right now, both of you are experts. You lost it all. You lost your daughters. You are an expert. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentlemen yields. I now recognize the gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Brecheen, for his 5 minutes of testimony or questioning. Mr. Brecheen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Given a mark-up that is going on in Budget, appreciate your indulgences with me slipping in. You know, just as my colleague just talked about, just the great loss. I thank you both very much for your courage, given what you have been through. We know that the decisions by Mayorkas, in addition to just this administration's decisions, have caused chaos on our Southern Border. Just their reluctance to simply enforce Congressional law, whether it is parole, detention, deportation, these are all things that Congress set up as a barrier to protect us against the heinous acts that the mothers in this room, your families, have been the victims of. I want to ask you, Ms. Nobles, in your testimony, you said that the El Salvadorian government had a documented criminal history of your daughter's murderer. Now, we are talking about an illegal alien who assaulted, sexually assaulted, and murdered your daughter. They were aware of this involvement and that there was an MS-13 gang membership also associated this individual. How long after your daughter's death were you made aware of this? Ms. Nobles. At first we did not know that it was MS-13 until after the DNA evidence came back and linked him. Then once he was arrested, then we were told it was an MS-13 gang member. He has, like, 11 charges against him right now. Mr. Brecheen. What was the Federal agency that provided that information to you? Ms. Nobles. It was no Federal. It was--it took the local detectives to find out that he was MS-13. Mr. Brecheen. When you were told this, were you given an explanation why DHS, Department of Homeland Security, never checked his body tattoos that would bring about, you know, suspicion or contact the government to ask if he had affiliations or a prior criminal history? Have you had a chance to ask DHS about that failure? Ms. Nobles. No. DHS and DHHS has failed to make a comment or say anything to me about Kayla or anything. Mr. Brecheen. Let me ask you, do you think, Ms. Nobles, that the Secretary is doing everything he can to secure that Southern Border? Ms. Nobles. No. Mr. Brecheen. No. I know it comes across as a question that anyone who has lost what you have lost, you have the utmost right to be heard by the American people. It is one thing to abstract talk about this. It is another thing to be victimized by someone's refusal to enforce what the law of the land is, what Congressional law is. If you were able to speak to Secretary Mayorkas, which, you know, my inclination is he probably is paying attention, even though he is refusing to come and be a part with the invitation that our Chairman sent him, what would you say to Secretary Mayorkas, and what questions would you ask him? I will give you all the time you want. I am going to end my conclusions there. When you get done, Ms. Nobles, if there is time, Ms. Dunn, on the clock up here, I would love to hear your comments as well. What would you tell the Secretary? Ms. Nobles. I would ask him, how did you allow a known gang member to be allowed in this country? How can anyone be OK with a known gang member to come into this country and to end up in Maryland? I also wanted to know what else DHS and DHHS is hiding. I was told that her murderer's file is so thick that Jim Jordan only had 2 hours to even look at the file. What else are they hiding about this murderer? I want to know. I mean, I'm not, you know--I want to know what they're hiding about this murderer. That's why he is being protected, why everything about him is being protected. We haven't even got to trial yet. Her trial is set for June 28 of this year, and they have 4 or 5 thick binders full of a bunch of evidence that we haven't even--know yet. We don't even know over half of the stuff that was done to her in that room. Mr. Brecheen. I am going to ask you as a follow-up, I got 30 seconds left, there is a statement that talks about--I actually quoted this to Mayorkas when he was before this committee. It actually comes out of the Old Testament or the Torah where it talks about blood on your hands. If you see destruction coming, talk about a watchman, and you don't cry out. Do you think the Secretary, based upon him knowing what is happening, letting people come into this country, do you think he has blood on his hands? Ms. Nobles. Yes. He is responsible for my daughter's death. Mr. Brecheen. Ms. Dunn. Mrs. Dunn. I know that Secretary Mayorkas has two daughters and they're grown adults. I just don't know how he would feel if it was one of his daughters that he lost to either one of these situations. We talked a little bit today about resources. OK? I have a resource in my purse. It's Narcan. It costs $45 in a pharmacy in Arizona. It's not free. You want to spend some money? You want to spend some of my tax dollars? Give this away for free everywhere. Anywhere. Everywhere. That's what you need to spend your money on. I don't want to spend any more money on illegals. I want to save lives. Mr. Brecheen. Thank you. Chairman Green. The gentlemen yields. I now recognize the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Luttrell, for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Luttrell. Thank you all for coming today. Everyone in here said it. I spoke to my Democratic colleagues and my Republican colleagues, and our hearts are with you. I hope that doesn't seem meaningless coming from where we are sitting today. Unfortunately, you have got to experience what Congress is all like right here in real life. Normally, when you are watching C-SPAN, you can usually turn it off, but this is how we interact with each other, unfortunately. But thank you, and I am very, very sorry for your loss. I was a military man in my former life. When forward- deployed overseas and tasked with securing any given area, we followed that under the Constitution as military men because we raised our right hand and swore to defend the Constitution of the United States. Sometimes our jobs were to prevent movement through any given space. Our job was to protect our men and women that were tasked underneath us wholeheartedly, unconditionally. In war, you lose men and women. You do. It is just part of the conflict. There is nothing that can be said to anybody when that happens, but it is absolute warfare. But as a military man, as an officer, if any given space that I was defending, if it was rushed by individuals and overtaken, I would be relieved of command, plain and simple. My leadership would look down at me as, like, you failed. We are going to relieve you of your duty. If I lost lives, most likely, if it was negligent, I would be relieved of duty. Depending on the surge of numbers and however that played out, there could possibly have been a court martial. I live by that. We all do. So when I see these numbers, and this is where I sit, why I am going after the impeachment is when I look to the leader that is supposed to be defending our country and just numbers, I don't care if Democrat, Republican, just sheer numbers, yearly, since the Secretary has been in position, the numbers have grown exponentially. They have. Numbers of which, if that had happened to us overseas, it would have been catastrophic, because if my leadership didn't take control and act accordingly, the Navy would have, and then it would have grown and grown and grown until we were held accountable. Each year since the Secretary has been in place, those numbers for fentanyl deaths, sex trade, gang members, not to mention the amount of addiction, we talk about deaths, but the addiction rate is astronomical. If those numbers were dipping down, that is one thing, but they are progressively getting worse and worse. They are out of control. Professor, I have a question for you. I know that you don't support the impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas Constitutionally. Do you support the removal, given the sheer numbers that we are seeing, do you support the removal or would you support the removal, period, of Secretary Mayorkas because of his failures to lead Department of Homeland Security? Ms. Pearlstein. I'm simply not an expert on immigration policy. Mr. Luttrell. No, it is a personal question. Ms. Pearlstein. I really don't have a position on the removal of Secretary Mayorkas. As a matter of law, I don't think the basis is---- Mr. Luttrell. No, this is personal. I know you say Constitutionally that is not the case. You don't support that. I understand that completely. I understand your perspective, and I appreciate it. But the United States is one of the leading countries in sex trafficking. Houston, Texas, is the worst city in the country, which is in my district. I represent over 700,000 men and women in District 8 in the great State of Texas. They are demanding the removal of Secretary Mayorkas. Demanding it. I am the voice in Washington, DC, to say, hey, I am speaking for my people, and this is what they are demanding. So since the administration, President Biden will not remove Mr. Mayorkas Constitutionally or however he sees it, and I understand your perspective, what I want to hear is, do you think Mr. Mayorkas needs to be removed because of his failure, in my opinion, in his role? Ms. Pearlstein. What I think you should tell your constituents in response to their demands is that they should vote for a different President. Mr. Luttrell. Well, that is--amen to that. I am sure they are on board with that exact statement. But I do every day have to sit in front of the mothers and fathers of them that have lost their babies and they are never going to get their babies back. I can tell them to vote all day long, but 4 years, it is an extremely long time to have somebody failing us in protecting our borders. So the Republican Party is having to act and act accordingly. That is why this impeachment process is happening. I understand. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Crane, for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Crane. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Dunn, Ms. Nobles, thank you so much for coming here today. I thank you for your courage. Ms. Dunn happens to be a constituent of mine. She once confronted me at a town hall in Yavapai County and begged me to do something about this invasion at our Southern Border. Honestly, I couldn't blame her one bit. As a father, I would have done the exact same thing that you did, ma'am. Ms. Dunn, after listening to my Democratic colleagues today, I think you probably had a decent idea of what the problem was before you came up here, but I think it is a lot more in focus now, is it not? I am glad you had a chance to confront the problem today. We will continue to confront the problem, but I am glad you got a chance to see it for yourself. Ms. Pearlstein, you said during the audio recording that the Chairman played one of the criteria for impeachment is serious offenses against public trust. Do you still stand by this comment today, ma'am? Ms. Pearlstein. As I've explained before, offenses against the public trust are instances in which an official is willfully acting for his own benefit or the benefit of his own power or on behalf of a foreign power. Mr. Crane. Thank you. How is this border crisis that has been planned and executed by Secretary Mayorkas not a serious offense to public trust, Ms. Pearlstein? Ms. Pearlstein. Having read through the materials, I see no evidence that Secretary Mayorkas has acted on behalf of his own benefit, financially or politically. I see no evidence that there is collusion or other cooperation or acting on behalf of foreign parties. Mr. Crane. Ma'am, do you see evidence of betrayal of public trust? If you need help finding that, ma'am, look to your right. There are two mothers in here that have had their complete lives destroyed, their families destroyed. I am going to ask, Ms. Dunn, has your public trust in Secretary Mayorkas and the Department of Homeland Security been broken? Mrs. Dunn. Yes, sir. Mr. Crane. Ms. Nobles. Ms. Nobles. Yes. Mr. Crane. Do you guys feel betrayed by Secretary Mayorkas and the Department of Homeland Security? You guys know his job is Secretary of Homeland Security? His job in his title is to protect the homeland, Homeland Security. Do you guys feel betrayed? Mrs. Dunn. Yes. Mr. Crane. I thought so. Ms. Pearlstein, are you familiar with Article IV, section 4, of the Constitution, often known as the invasion clause? Ms. Pearlstein. Yes, I've read the Constitution. Mr. Crane. That is not what I asked, ma'am. I asked if you are familiar with that Article. Ms. Pearlstein. Yes, yes. Mr. Crane. Thank you. I am going to read it. ``The United States shall guarantee to every State in this union a republican form of government,'' and here is the point, ``and shall protect each of them against invasion.'' Ms. Nobles, Ms. Dunn, do you think that this Homeland Security Secretary is protecting these States against invasion, he is protecting Arizona? Mrs. Dunn. Arizona is not protected against invasion. Mr. Crane. Ms. Perlstein, after having me read that, do you think that this Secretary is protecting the 50 States against invasion? Ms. Pearlstein. The word ``invasion'' in that clause is not in reference to migrants who are not trying to overthrow the government of the United States. Mr. Crane. Oh, it is interesting that you say that, ma'am. Very interesting that you say that. Ma'am, Ms. Pearlstein, have you ever studied unconventional warfare? Any idea what that term means? Ms. Pearlstein. I've heard that term used. I'm not an expert in unconventional warfare. Mr. Crane. Do you have any idea what it might mean? Go ahead, take a stab at it. Ms. Pearlstein. I would rather hear your definition. Mr. Crane. OK, great. Do you think, in any wild and unprecedented strategy in the history of the world, one of our adversaries might try and send their soldiers to infiltrate our country using our wide-open border? Not putting them in uniforms and having them come and present themselves in front of our Border Patrol agents and tell our Border Patrol agents, oh, we are just innocent immigrants. We just want a better life. Do you think that is even possible, Ms. Pearlstein? Ms. Pearlstein. Might anyone ever lie at the border? Yes. Mr. Crane. OK. So it is possible that tens of thousands-- you know that is how many we are getting a day, right, ma'am? About 10,000 a day, 10- to 15,000 a day. Are you aware of that? Ms. Pearlstein. I'm not aware of any statistics. Mr. Crane. OK. Well, I will fill you in then, ma'am. You are in the Homeland Security Committee. It is about 10- to 15,000, often, sometimes 12,000 a day. That is more than a combat division coming through our Southern Border from 160 countries, some of which are adversarial. I am going to tell you right now, unconventional warfare has been used since the beginning of time. These people aren't stupid. They are using access to our country to bring in individuals who want to do harm to it. I have been in the Classified briefs. It is a fact, ma'am. How many families have to be ruined? How many mothers have to sit next to you before you come to understand this is an invasion of our country and he is in complete dereliction of duty of his constitutional oath to protect and defend the United States of America? How many, ma'am? Would we need to have 100 here today for you? Ms. Pearlstein. Impeachment will not address the policy problem you describe. Mr. Crane. That is not a policy problem. That is him completely derelicting his oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. I read you the invasion clause. He is not doing that, ma'am. He is in complete dereliction of doing it in accordance with the other laws that other committee Members have read to you today. I think it is sad. This shouldn't be a partisan issue at all, and you know it. I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentlemen yields. I now recognize Ms. Titus, the gentlelady from Nevada, for her 5 minutes of questioning. Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to offer my deepest sympathy to the witnesses for their loss. Professor, you are the only expert in here on this topic. Would you say one more time for the record if the Constitution covers what Mr. Crane called dereliction of his oath or any of the things that are being addressed here in terms of grounds for impeachment? Ms. Pearlstein. I don't believe the record supports grounds for impeachment here, no. Ms. Titus. Are you in the mainstream of other Constitutional scholars who have taken this position, written letters to the Post, written letters to our Chairman, been public about this impeachment? Ms. Pearlstein. I signed a letter that was in addition to another dozen or more bipartisan set of Constitutional law scholars who took the same position. Ms. Titus. I want to emphasize that was a bipartisan list of scholars who are very versed in this topic and who know it better than any of us sitting up here. So it was interesting to me that when I heard Ms. Greene and her tirade against you, saying we are not talking about the Constitution. She actually had the gall to say, we are not talking about the Constitution, and she is the one who entered the resolution that we are considering. So if we are not talking about the Constitution, what are we talking about? Well, we are wasting our breath talking about history, talking about precedent, talking about previous cases, talking about the language of the Constitution, talking about the original intent of the Constitution, because obviously the people on that side of the room are not talking about the Constitution. So they are throwing out 200 years of precedent. They are ignoring the interpretation of all these Constitutional scholars. They are disregarding some of the comments that have been made by Members of their own party about the folly of this resolution and this pursuit. So if we are not talking about the Constitution, then what are we talking about? It is a political stunt. It is an attempt to distract from a do-nothing Congress that has done nothing, and even less compared to the do-nothing Congress so named by Truman. You know, I see another quote that I think is relevant. It was by the Assistant Secretary of Labor Mr. Post, who they brought up to impeach in 1920. By the way, it has only been done one time over 100 years ago, but they tried it in 1920. His response was, it was mental dullness at high tension. I believe we have seen a lot of evidence today of mental dullness at high tension with raised voices, with misinformation, with accusations, with demeaning comments. That was mental dullness at high tension. So if we are not talking about the Constitution, we are just trying to use some Constitutional terms to pretend like stump the professor, we know more than they do. I would say that my colleagues across the aisle are simply just trying to put lipstick on a pig. I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentlelady yields. I now recognize the Ranking Member for his closing statement. Mr. Thompson. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I compliment the gentlelady from Nevada, even though you sound like you are from Mississippi with your accent. Let me just say that we have had about 4\1/2\, 5 hours of hearing today on this so-called impeachment. It is unfortunate because we have not heard any solutions being offered in the course of this hearing. Because of that, whatever the problem is will still be there unless we as Democrats and Republicans come together and work on solutions. But I would like to start by thanking our witnesses for being here today and share their stories and expertise. Losing a loved one to drugs or violence is devastating, and our hearts go out to you and your families. Most of us here are family people, and we can only give you our prayers for the devastating loss that you have incurred. But I want to make sure that the record is clear. Secretary Mayorkas informed the Majority last week of his scheduling conflict for today, and I am sorry if the Majority neglected to share that information with our witnesses. I would also want to make very clear that Democrats are committed to enacting policies that will actually address these issues. Impeaching Secretary Mayorkas would do nothing to prevent other families from suffering similar tragedies. If only it were that simple. These problems are not new. They will require serious policy making, not an impeachment vote that will do nothing but undermine our Constitutional system. If my Republican colleagues were serious about addressing these issues, they would be working on legislation, collaborating with our Senate counterparts and the White House. Right now, Congress has a pending request from President Biden to fund additional Border Patrol agents, additional law enforcement personnel, and increased fentanyl detection technology. House Republicans have refused to consider this request. Instead of pursuing solutions to these problems, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are chasing an illegitimate impeachment and using tragedy to score political points. This entire process has been conducted in bad faith with a predetermined outcome. It is clear from my earlier parliamentary inquiries that the Chairman has not established any due process or procedures for this sham of an impeachment. The Majority has refused to work with the Department to find a day and time to hear from Secretary Mayorkas despite his offer to do so. Let's not forget that my Republican colleague forced their border bill, H.R. 2, through this committee without considering any Democratic input, resulting in a bill full of unworkable provisions that would create chaos on the Southwest Border. They know as well as anyone that H.R. 2 never had a chance of becoming law. Senate Republicans and Democrats are working together in a bipartisan manner and with the direct involvement of Secretary Mayorkas to try to fix the issues raised here today. Yet instead of joining that conversation and using the powers of the Congress to create change, House Republicans are pursuing a partisan impeachment effort that will achieve nothing. Perhaps this is because a bipartisan reform bill would take away from a Republican political talking point. As one Republican Member told CNN earlier this month, he has no interest in trying to pass border legislation that might help Joe Biden's approval rating. That is really what this impeachment sham is all about, a political game to make it seem like the do-nothing Republican Caucus achieves something while attacking the Biden administration. It is the American people that are paying the price of Republican inaction. This impeachment hearing just distracts from the important work that DHS is doing to secure the border and enforce immigration laws. So let me share some of that work. From May to September 2023, DHS removed or returned at least 360,000 noncitizens from the United States, more than any other 5-month period in the last 10 years. From April 2022 to September 2023, DHS arrested nearly 17,000 suspected human smugglers and seized more than $13 million in currency. In fiscal year 2023, DHS stopped over 43,000 pounds of fentanyl from entering the country, resulting in over 5,600 arrests. President Biden has requested the necessary funding, but Republicans would rather shut down the entire Federal Government than give President Biden another win. Mr. Chairman, what other conclusion can the American people draw but that House Republicans don't actually want to fix the problem on our Southern Border? The Constitution gives Congress broad and expansive powers to create laws and shape the policies we want to see. It gives us strong tools to perform oversight over the execution of those policies. Yet that is not what we have seen here today. Those real levers of power don't seem to be flashy enough for my Republican colleagues. They don't want to do the hard work of creating workable laws or collaborating or compromising. It is far easier to demand impeachment. Instead of engaging in a good-faith effort to improve homeland security, House Republicans are more interested in giving interviews on FOX News. As Professor Pearlstein has explained today, there is no Constitutional basis for impeaching Secretary Mayorkas. We heard the same from Professor Bowman last week, and we heard the same from the many other Constitutional law experts that have written our committee. There is reason they have not brought a Constitutional expert to testify in support of this impeachment. There are no Constitutional basis for impeachment. Democrats will continue to keep our focus throughout this sham impeachment on what our obligations are under the Constitution. As I said last week, Mr. Chairman, when your Members are ready to work and to use the actual power given to us by the Framers to address policy problems, I guarantee you House Democrats will do our best to work with you. But until then, we will continue to call out this do-nothing approach. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I would like to spend my closing statement reviewing why we have held impeachment proceedings against Secretary Mayorkas since my Democrat colleagues still don't seem to get it. Secretary Mayorkas has willfully and systematically refused to follow immigration laws written by Congress. Indeed, he has unilaterally created policies that violate the statutory provisions of the immigration laws related to enforcement. In fact, most courts that have actually heard relevant arguments and decided on the merits agree. The problem is when the arguments on enforcement went to the Supreme Court in the United States v. Texas, the Court refused to decide the matter. The Court said it was not subject to judicial review and they pointed Congress to remedy via impeachment. The Court said if the States can't get relief from the courts, they can get relief from Congress, who can impeach the offending official. Well, now Congress is the proper forum to resolve this dispute. We now have to decide, does the legislation enacted by the people's duly-elected representatives mean anything or can the Secretary just do whatever he wants in direct contradiction to the mandatory language in Federal law with impunity? I argue that he cannot continue to not follow the law without consequences. This isn't a policy difference. This is a matter of following the laws written by Congress and thus a matter of Constitutional significance. Today's Minority witness recognized back in 2019 that someone could be impeached for a breach of trust. James Madison, the primary architect of the Constitution, was elected to the House of Representatives to serve in the First Congress. At that time, a bill was proposed to create a Department of Foreign Affairs, now the State Department. Concerns were raised that if Congress created such a department, it could be filled by people who abused the public trust. Madison worried about it, and I quote, ``the difficulty of displacing those who are unworthy of the public trust.'' But he pointed to a solution for that concern. He said on the House floor, and I quote, ``If an unworthy man be continued in office by an unworthy President, the House of Representatives can at any time impeach him and the Senate can remove him whether the President chooses or not.'' I don't know about you, but I trust the interpretation of the Father of our Constitution more than the interpretation of those desperate to defend the indefensible for political gain. The President has chosen to continue to keep an unworthy man in office, and it is now the duty of the House of Representatives to impeach Secretary Mayorkas and the Senate to remove him from office. The Minority witness said, We could pass laws to address these issues, but to what end? The Secretary has already shown he will not follow the laws passed by Congress. Secretary Mayorkas has consistently and deliberately violated duly- enacted laws under the Immigration and Nationality Act that Congress has put into place to protect Americans and guard our Nation's sovereignty. Secretary Mayorkas has refused to comply with court orders regarding those very laws in good faith. Additionally, Secretary Mayorkas has on numerous occasions lied or misled the U.S. Congress and the American people regarding the existence and scale of the border crisis that he created. Secretary Mayorkas told the House Judiciary Committee on April 2022 that he had operational control of the Southern Border according to the definition laid out by the Secure Fence Act. By the way, that definition was passed into law by Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton. Of course, Secretary Mayorkas, his own former Border Patrol chief, testified before this committee in March of last year that according to the statute, DHS does not have operational control. Secretary Mayorkas's pure dishonesty was on full display. Again, not a policy issue. To those claiming this impeachment hearing is against the Constitution and against the separation of powers, I am sorry, that is ridiculous. President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas are the ones who have trampled on the Constitution and the separation of powers by ignoring a coequal branch of Government. As far as I understand, the Constitution, the Constitution I swore an oath to at age 17 on the plane at West Point, Congress writes the laws and the Executive branch executes those laws. But that is exactly, absolutely not what Secretary Mayorkas has been doing when it comes to our country's immigration laws. In fact, he has been spitting on those laws, and thus the Constitution in the last 3 years. Impeachment is our final remedy. We are left with no other choice. This is also not a resource issue. Democrats are wrong when they claim that the reason this border crisis is happening is because there aren't enough resources at the border and that Republicans have refused to fund the Border Patrol. First of all, House Republicans have voted substantial increases in funding for CBP above the President's requested amount. In fact, funding the Border Patrol operations and related Southwest Border requirements increased $2.2 billion since fiscal year 2021. Additionally, House Republicans in the fiscal year 2024 Homeland Security appropriations bill, where we fund the Government, increased border security funding, again above the President's proposed budget. On top of this, H.R. 2, the Secure Border Act, would fund a Border Patrol force of 22,000. Yet did any Democrat here vote for that? No. It is the definition of hypocrisy. Second, Secretary Mayorkas actually asked for less money each year to fund detention, the one thing that is a deterrent to people coming and making that trek. Third, it won't matter how many resources we have at the border if the policies don't change and follow the laws written by Congress. President Biden's supplemental package would do nothing to secure the border between ports of entry, and it would do nothing to stop the flow of migrants to our border. No, every cent of Biden's supplemental package would go directly toward funding mass catch-and-release policies. That is a nonstarter. That is what has created the crisis in the first place. This is clearly not an issue of funding. DHS has had less funding under the Trump administration for border security, yet our border was far more secure. Funding Biden's supplemental package won't fix the crisis at the border. It will fund it. Again, it's not a funding problem. Secretary Mayorkas' complete disregard for the laws passed by Congress have had a devastating impact. That is what we learn today. Everyone knows the numbers. As one Texas sheriff has said, and I quote, ``It's, quite frankly, a tsunami of death that has crashed into the United States over our Southern Border. It's killing Americans wholesale, and it's just an epic slaughter manufactured by the cartels. If you don't secure the border, it is going to continue.'' Slaughter is the right word to describe what fentanyl is doing to our country, to our young people, to many of our sons and daughters. What else do you call 100,000 overdose deaths in 2021? A comparison was made earlier today between incarceration rates of native citizens and immigrants. Well, whatever that is, it misses the point that every crime committed by anyone who is here illegally is a completely preventable crime. If you shut the border, those lives are saved. To prevent those crimes, you need only enforce the immigration laws on the books, which is exactly what Secretary Mayorkas is willfully not doing. This hearing is titled ``Voices for the Victims: The Heartbreaking Reality of the Mayorkas Border Crisis.'' Tammy Noble's daughter Kayla Marie Hamilton no longer has a voice. Josephine Dunn's daughter, Ashley Marie Dunn, no longer has a voice. That is why we held this hearing today. It is our duty to be the voices of those who can't speak for themselves and to demand accountability on their behalf. Finally, to Secretary Mayorkas, who couldn't be bothered to show up today, Secretary Mayorkas, you have one job, follow the laws and secure the homeland. Yet you allow criminal aliens to walk across our border, to spit in the face of our country's laws, and to exploit vulnerable migrants. Secretary Mayorkas, you have one responsibility, follow the law and secure the homeland. Yet you allow massive amounts of fentanyl to flow across the border and poison tens of thousands of Americans. Secretary Mayorkas, you have one duty, to follow the law and secure this homeland. Yet you refuse to let our Border Patrol do its job and keep criminal aliens from coming across the border or allow ICE to deport all criminal aliens when caught. You have one job, one responsibility, one duty, and you have refused to fulfill it over and over again. You have refused to follow the laws and to secure our homeland, yet you shrink your responsibility. This is utterly disgraceful. Now, I would like to make a few other points. Someone today has made a point, I can't recall if it was a Member or the Minority witness that if you remove the Secretary, there will be no change because they will just put another guy in there like that. Well, I have a duty to the people of Tennessee and the people of America that if we have a lawless Cabinet Secretary who refuses to obey the laws written by Congress and who refuses court orders to cease and desist, totally disrespecting the two other equal branches of Government in our Constitution, I have a duty under the Constitution to remove him. It doesn't matter if the devil I don't know is worse than the devil I do. My duty is to remove him, and I will do my duty. There have been some, I think, we will say disingenuous comments about our efforts to get Mr. Mayorkas here today. We have tried for months and months to get him to come and testify on the border issues. The only time he has come is when he is Constitutionally or legally mandated to present the National threats briefing. He came with the director. I was glad he was here for that. He has not worked with me to be here. In fact, today he decided to meet with some Mexican officials who come from Mexico instead of being present at this hearing. That ought to tell you where his priorities are. Now, some people have suggested, of course, that we could pass some more legislation. Well, again, I did say, what is the use if he is not going to abide by it? But you know what? H.R. 2 sits over there on the other side of the building. Well, actually, it is that way. I am not directionally challenged. It is that way. Amend it. Take the parts you don't like out of it. I think that is the process. Then it comes back over here, we go to conference committee, and we work it out. You don't just sit and leave it sitting on a desk and say, you are not writing legislation. Well, yeah, we sent it to you. The process is, you amend it in your committee, vote on that amended version in the Senate, and send it back to conference. So don't sit there and say, we haven't done anything. That was months ago. I have to address the Ranking Member's suggestion that we would use these young women as political pawns to make a political statement. I am offended by that. His closing remarks could have been made at a political rally. It is despicable to suggest that I would use the two of you as political stunts. I am trying to show that every American is unsafe right now with these ridiculous border policies. What happened to you ladies and your daughters could happen to any American. The reason they have happened is because the Secretary isn't following the laws passed by this body, both Republicans and Democrats. If he were a Republican, I would be saying the exact same thing. It has nothing to do with politics for me. I spent 24 years prepared to give my life for this country. At times I thought I might have. No, what matters to me is that document that I swore an oath to defend. This Secretary has spit on it by saying that coequal branches of Government don't matter to him. I am sorry, he has got to go. I thank the witnesses for their valuable testimony and the Members for their questions. The Members of the subcommittees may have some additional questions for the witnesses, and we would ask that the witnesses respond to those in writing. Pursuant to committee rule VII(D) the hearing record would be held open for 10 days. Mr. Thompson. Mr. Chairman. Chairman Green. Without objection--the Ranking Member is recognized. Mr. Thompson. You know, we have talked several times about the rules, and we can disagree with Democrats and Republicans, but I call your attention to House rules that you have referenced my comments, that they were despicable. That is against House rules. Chairman Green. Actually, calling you despicable would be against House rules. Calling your words despicable are not. Mr. Thompson. Well---- Chairman Green. I can even say it is dishonest, what you said. I can't say you are a liar. It is very clear and I have made that distinction before, actually gaveling down comments made by a Republican. She actually, in that case, called the Secretary a liar. She didn't say--others have said those words are dishonest or that is a lie. You can say that. You can't say the individual is a liar. Her words were despicable. Mr. Thompson. Well---- Chairman Green. I didn't say anything about you personally. Mr. Thompson. Well, then I am clear. As long as you didn't make Bennie Thompson---- Chairman Green. Yeah, I would never say that about an individual sitting in this committee. Mr. Thompson. Thank you. Chairman Green. But I was very disappointed with your accusation that I would use these individuals as political pawns. Mr. Thompson. Well, Mr. Chairman, your disappointment is fine. But one of the tenets of who we are as a democracy is that I have an opinion and you have an opinion, and let's respect that. So as long as you understand that we can disagree on the words. I was just trying to get clarification about that. Since you say you weren't talking about me specifically, then I am fine. I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentlemen yields. The committee stands adjourned.  A P P E N D I X ---------- Letters From the Department of Homeland Security Submitted by Chairman Green January 30, 2024. The Honorable Mark E. Green, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC 20510. Dear Chairman Green: On January 5, 2024, you sent a letter to me requesting that I again appear before the House Homeland Security Committee to provide testimony. I have testified before this Committee seven times. I agreed to testify again and asked to work with your staff to identify a mutually agreeable date. You did not respond to my request, changed course, and instead invited me to submit written testimony. Two days later, you issued a statement representing that every member of the Committee's majority already had rendered their decision. I respectfully submit this letter in response. The problems with our broken and outdated immigration system are not new. I assumed office in February 2021. Immigration cases concluded that year reportedly had been languishing in court for an average of 1,319 days. In 2010, that average was 347 days. The Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration Review reports that at the end of Fiscal Year 2020, there were 1,261,144 cases in the immigration court backlog. In 2017 that number was 656,383. The DHS Office of Immigration Statistics reported that there were approximately 11.4 million undocumented individuals present in the United States in 2018. Our immigration laws last received an overhaul in 1996. Our immigration laws were simply not built for 21st Century migration patterns. In 2019, prior to the onset of COVID and as country conditions in Latin America were on the decline, the number of migrants encountered at our Southwest Border increased almost 100 percent over the prior year. In this post-COVID period, the challenges at our border have again intensified as the world experiences the greatest displacement of people since World War II and our entire hemisphere is gripped with mass migration brought on by violence, food insecurity, severe poverty, corruption, authoritarian regimes, and the destruction of homes and communities by extreme weather events. These movements are facilitated by human smuggling organizations that exploit migrants as part of a billion-dollar criminal enterprise. The depth of suffering that migrants are willing to endure speaks to the desperation they feel about their prospects at home. We need a legislative solution and only Congress can provide it. I have been privileged to join a bipartisan group of United States Senators these past several months to provide technical and operational expertise in support of their efforts to strengthen our country's border security. These efforts would yield significant new enforcement tools and make a substantial difference at our border. Our law enforcement personnel need additional resources to execute our border security and enforcement strategy, which is why the administration requested supplemental funding in August and then again in October 2023. That request included the hiring of an additional 1,300 Border Patrol Agents, 1,000 law enforcement officers and the purchase and deployment of over 100 cutting-edge Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) systems to prevent cartels from moving fentanyl into the country, and 1,600 additional asylum officers to rapidly adjudicate claims for asylum and facilitate timely decisions so that those who are ineligible can be quickly removed and those with valid claims can receive prompt resolution. Instead, you claim that we have failed to enforce our immigration laws. That is false. We have provided Congress and your Committee hours of testimony, thousands of documents, hundreds of briefings, and much more information that demonstrates quite clearly how we are enforcing the law. The extensive material we have provided informed you that, for example: This Administration has removed, returned, or expelled more migrants in 3 years than the prior Administration did in 4 years. Since May 12, 2023, DHS has removed or returned more than 500,000 individuals, the vast majority of whom crossed the Southwest Border. Total removals and returns since mid-May 2023 exceed removals and returns in every full fiscal year since 2015. Daily removals and returns are nearly double what they were compared to the pre-pandemic average from 2014 to 2019. The majority of individuals encountered at the Southwest Border throughout this Administration have been removed, returned, or expelled. We have significantly increased the number of removal flights within the Western Hemisphere since the end of Title 42, sending over 20 flights per week of individuals who have been rapidly processed and determined to be removable. We continue to repatriate individuals to more than 150 countries. Before 2013, the majority of individuals attempting to cross the border entered without being caught. Under this Administration, the estimated annual apprehension rate has averaged 78 percent, the same average rate of apprehension as in the prior Administration. We developed and implemented a regulation that created a presumption of ineligibility for asylum if an individual who crossed the Southwest Border without authorization traveled through another country and failed to meet defined criteria, including the use of lawful pathways made available to them. We have been executing an unprecedented and high-impact campaign to disrupt and dismantle the smuggling organizations. More than 14,000 smugglers throughout the region have been arrested and thousands have been prosecuted under Federal law. We have worked with Mexico to conduct mirrored patrols along the Southwest Border, and we have worked with Mexico and other countries to increase interdictions along the migratory routes, increase repatriation flights, and execute the removal of third-country nationals. Last year we secured funding to hire 300 more Border Patrol Agents, the first increase in more than a decade. Last year I was honored to promote Jason Owens, a career Border Patrol Agent, as the new Chief of the United States Border Patrol. Undoubtedly, we have policy disagreements on the historically divisive issue of immigration. That has been the case between Administrations and Members of Congress for much longer than the past 38 years since the last overhaul of our immigration system. I think it is unconscionable to separate children from their parents as a tool of deterrence. I believe that law enforcement at the border can be tough and humane. It is our responsibility to the American people to work through our differences and try to reach solutions together. The bipartisan group of United States Senators is currently doing just that. The trafficking and use of illegal drugs are also not new problems for our country. We have been fighting the war against drugs for decades. When I was working to convict drug dealers and traffickers as a Federal prosecutor throughout the 1990's--including the prosecution of the largest cocaine money laundering operation in the country at the time--I saw up close the loss and damage wreaked by black tar heroin, methamphetamine, crack cocaine, and other illegal drugs. I was dedicated then, as I am now, to defeating this scourge upon our country. What I saw for 12 years as a Federal prosecutor does not compare to what our country has experienced and what we have been fighting for more than the past 7 years. The addictiveness and fatality of synthetic opioids have cost hundreds of thousands of lives and have ravaged communities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids--primarily fentanyl--began to climb in 2014 and have accelerated since. Provisional data from the CDC reflects 28,659 overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids in 2017, escalating to 56,894 in 2020; 71,143 in 2021; and 74,789 in 2022. Every death from drug overdoses and poisoning is a tragedy. The battle against fentanyl presents unique challenges because fentanyl is cheap to make, easily concealed, and made with precursor chemicals and materials that have legal uses. We have intensified our efforts against the cartels and developed new strategies in response. In Fiscal Year 2023 our targeted operations seized more than 43,000 pounds of fentanyl, 3,600 pill presses, and $16 million in currency. We work closely with partners in other countries. Homeland Security Investigations has established 16 Transnational Criminal Investigative Units (TCIUs) that are successfully supporting investigations and prosecutions abroad. In Fiscal Year 2023, efforts by the Mexico TCIU resulted in more than 59 criminal arrests and the seizure of 64,138 pounds of precursor chemicals. To better detect smuggling, we are dramatically expanding the use of NII technology at ports of entry, through which more than 90 percent of fentanyl is smuggled into the United States. We are adding new state-of-the-art NII systems to complement those currently in use across Southwest Border ports of entry, with 72 construction projects underway at 15 ports. Our strategy has evolved to target not just fentanyl, but also the tools and materials the transnational criminal organizations use to make it. We are interdicting and seizing precursor chemicals, pill press machines, die molds, and pill press parts used in the manufacturing process. We are targeting Chinese pill press and precursor supply chains, Mexican pill press brokers, the Mexican transnational criminal organizations and the domestic traffickers who are producing and moving fentanyl, and the money launderers who help facilitate this illicit trade. Our efforts over the past year have resulted in the seizure of nearly 1 million pounds of fentanyl and methamphetamine precursor chemicals. Our Department is helping partners in the Western Hemisphere and Asia build their own capacity to combat the smuggling of illicit fentanyl. We recently established a working group for on-going communication and law enforcement coordination with the People's Republic of China to increase cooperation and information sharing. We are innovating with the responsible use of artificial intelligence at our ports of entry. This year alone, machine learning models that help CBP Officers determine which suspicious vehicles and passengers to refer to secondary screening have led to 240 seizures, which included thousands of pounds of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and fentanyl. More details about our efforts to combat fentanyl can be found in this recent DHS fact sheet. There is much more to do in the fight against fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. We must reduce both supply and demand. To accomplish this, we must work together to tackle what we all agree is a horrific problem that poses grave danger to our citizens, our communities, and our Nation. The Chairman and Members of the Committee's majority have harshly criticized the Department's responsiveness to oversight. The allegations are baseless and inaccurate. I take very seriously my responsibility to cooperate in good faith with Congress's oversight function. I have devoted significant Departmental resources and personal time to this effort. I have testified publicly in 27 congressional hearings since I became DHS Secretary. Twelve of those hearings were in the House of Representatives, including seven before the House Homeland Security Committee. I have testified more than any other member of the Cabinet. In every House hearing, I was asked and I answered many questions about immigration and the border. In all but one of those hearings, I was asked and I answered questions about our counter-fentanyl work. The Department has produced thousands of pages of documents, provided countless briefings, and sent dozens of witnesses to appear in hearings and transcribed interviews. We have produced more than 13,000 pages of documents and data in response to this Committee's requests alone. Further information evidencing the Department's response to congressional oversight is attached. Whatever proceedings you initiate, however baseless, my responsiveness to oversight requests will not waiver. The Department has been committed to responding and will continue to respond in good faith to congressional oversight requests. I will defer a discussion of the Constitutionality of your current effort to the many respected scholars and experts across the political spectrum who already have opined that it is contrary to law. What I will not defer to others is a response to the politically motivated accusations and personal attacks you have made against me. I have been privileged to serve our country for most of my professional life. I have adhered scrupulously and fervently to the Oath of Office I have taken six times in my public service career. My reverence for law enforcement was instilled in me by my parents, who brought me to this country to escape the Communist takeover of Cuba and allow me the freedoms and opportunity that our democracy provides. My parents experienced such loss at the fisted hands of authoritarianism that the American law enforcement officer stood as a tangible symbol of safety and the rule of law in our new home. When I was a boy, my mother would have me jump out of the back seat of our family's station wagon, approach a police officer in uniform, extend my hand, and say thank you. It was because of everything America meant and gave to my family that I was motivated to enter public service. It was because of my admiration and respect for the men and women who wore a badge that I wanted to work with them to enforce our country's laws. In 1989, I was privileged to take the Oath of Office and be sworn-in as an Assistant United States Attorney for the Central District of California. For the next nearly 9 years, I worked with Federal, State, and local law enforcement agents and officers in the investigation and prosecution of Federal crimes. We seized and forfeited property purchased with proceeds of drug deals, and successfully prosecuted bank robbers; counterfeiters; members of the MS-13, 18th Street, Crips, Bloods, and other street gangs; cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and marijuana traffickers; migrant smugglers; illegal border crossers (most often criminals with multiple felonies, deportations, and reentries); fraudulent document manufacturers; illegal telemarketers; and many others. In 1996 I became the Chief of our General Crimes Section, where I trained all new Assistant United States Attorneys in the investigation and prosecution of Federal criminal cases and how to try them before a jury. I have represented the United States in a Federal courtroom in hundreds of hard-fought criminal cases. In 1998 I was confirmed to serve as the United States Attorney for the Central District of California. I was the first Federal prosecutor in our office's history to be promoted from within to the top leadership position. To have my father at my side as I took the Oath to assume that role was one of the proudest moments of my life. Over the next 3 years, I prosecuted cases of national and international significance, enforcing a wide breadth of criminal statutes. I pursued the death penalty against members of the Mexican mafia, brought RICO charges against a Los Angeles street gang, and successfully prosecuted Federal cases of money laundering, public corruption, human trafficking, foreign corrupt practices, drug trafficking, securities fraud, violent crime, immigration fraud, organized crime, and much more. A partial list of the recognition I received for my work as an Assistant United States Attorney and as the United States Attorney is attached. I returned to public service in August 2009, upon my confirmation as the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. I vividly remember taking the Oath and getting to work on a top-to-bottom review of the agency and leading a subsequent realignment to best serve its mission. As a result of that review, I created a new Directorate within the agency--the Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate--to prioritize and more effectively fulfill the fundamental responsibilities of safeguarding our homeland and protecting the integrity of our legal immigration system. I served as the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for 4 years, until I was nominated and confirmed by the U.S. Senate to serve as the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security. My responsibilities as the Deputy Secretary covered the entire expanse of the Department's work, from going after the drug cartels, building the Department's cybersecurity capabilities, combating illegal immigration, and strengthening the Department's partnerships with State and local law enforcement, to negotiating security agreements with foreign countries, implementing new trade and travel protocols, and advancing our interests in the Arctic. For my service as the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, I was awarded the Distinguished Service Award, the Department's highest civilian honor; the Distinguished Public Service Award, the United States Coast Guard's highest civilian honor; and recognition and awards from law enforcement agencies across the Department and the Federal Government. On February 2, 2021, I took the Oath for the sixth time in my public service career and was sworn-in as the Secretary of Homeland Security. I am now in my 22nd year of service to our country. I no longer introduce and argue evidence in a Federal courtroom to persuade the jury to convict a dangerous criminal, but the mission to which I remain devoted is the same: to safeguard the American people. I assure you that your false accusations do not rattle me and do not divert me from the law enforcement and broader public service mission to which I have devoted most of my career and to which I remain devoted. The privilege of working alongside the 260,000 men and women who serve in the Department of Homeland Security--the privilege of working with incredibly talented and dedicated people on behalf of the United States of America--is the greatest thing one can do. Sincerely, Alejandro N. Mayorkas Secretary. ______ January 29, 2024. The Honorable Mark E. Green, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC 20510. Dear Chairman Green: Thank you for your January 17, 2024, letter regarding oversight requests to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS or the Department) by the Committee on Homeland Security. I am responding on behalf of the Department. DHS works in good faith to provide the Committee with the information it needs to conduct its legitimate oversight and legislative objectives. This is accomplished through many forms of communication. For example, since the start of the Biden administration, the Department has provided 90 witnesses for 56 Committee hearings, including 27 appearances by the Secretary, more than any other member of the President's Cabinet. The Department has also produced more than 25,000 pages of documents in response to over 1,400 congressional letters, including more than 13,000 pages to this Committee, during this Congress alone. Additionally, the Department has provided nearly 20 employees for transcribed interviews. It has done so while answering to more than 70 committees and subcommittees of jurisdiction, including this Committee. The Department strives to respond to oversight requests, but it is constrained by the content of the requests themselves, as well as limited internal resources. For example, the Committee makes many requests for classified information, records that require interagency review, and datasets drawing information from multiple DHS offices and agencies. DHS must respond with information that is accurate and with appropriate security and privacy safeguards. This requires careful prioritization of limited departmental resources. As such, in several instances, the Department has asked the Committee to prioritize requests and narrow their scope in ways that would more accurately target the information sought. That is exactly the sort of accommodation process envisioned by our Constitution and the courts that interpret it.\1\ Rather than engaging in the accommodations process, the Committee has chosen to issue new requests with a pace, volume, and deadlines it knows are not reasonable. Moreover, the Committee continues to knowingly reiterate requests that DHS is unable to fulfill, such as requests for documents belonging to other agencies, requests for which there are no responsive records, and those which the Department is prohibited by law or policy from providing due to ongoing investigations. DHS has consistently identified these requests and complied with them to the extent permissible by any reasonable standard. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ See United States v. American Tel. Tel. Co., 567 F.2d 121 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (``Negotiation between the two branches should thus be viewed as a dynamic process affirmatively furthering the constitutional scheme.''); Trump v. Mazars U.S., LLP, 140 S. Ct. 2019, 207 L. Ed. 2d 951 (2020) (Negotiations between the branches should ensure that a request is ``no broader than reasonably necessary to support Congress's legislative objective.'') --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Despite these obstacles, DHS has provided substantial cooperation and accommodation with the Committee, including: In response to a Committee letter dated January 30, 2023, the Department provided a narrative response on June 15, 2023, and produced two sets of documents on March 17 and June 15, 2023, totaling more than 600 pages. In response to a Committee letter dated January 31, 2023, the Department responded with a letter on March 1, 2023, in which it committed to making rolling productions. The Department has lived up to that commitment making productions on March 1, April 4, August 30, and November 20, 2023, totaling more than 2,100 pages of responsive documents. In response to a Committee letter dated May 10, 2023, the United States Coast Guard provided a classified briefing on October 1, 2023. In addition to that briefing, on October 31, 2023, the Department provided a written response accompanied by more than 1,000 pages of responsive documents. In response to a Committee letter dated May 10, 2023, the Department produced more than 850 pages of responsive records with a written response on November 1, 2023. In response to a Committee request dated May 19, 2023, the Department has been working closely with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which owns relevant information, to provide responses. On September 11, 2023, the Department submitted a written response that included an offer for a classified briefing. The Department has since provided multiple opportunities in a classified setting for the review of 750 pages of responsive records and continues to work with its interagency partners to produce additional records for the Committee's review. In response to a Committee request dated June 15, 2023, in addition to a written response dated October 5, 2023, the Department produced two sets of responsive documents on October 5 and December 20, 2023, totaling more than 900 pages. In response to a Committee letter dated September 27, 2023, the Department responded on November 3, 2023, with a letter clarifying the Department's role and indicating that the questions posed would be best answered by other Federal agencies. In response to a Committee letter dated December 11, 2023, on December 15, 2023, the Department offered to answer the Committee's questions in a briefing. Committee staff postponed initial plans for this briefing and have since been unresponsive to multiple attempts to reschedule. The Department continues to make rolling productions responsive to the Committee's two subpoenas. To date, the Department has produced more than 6,000 pages of records in response to those requests, and the Department continues to search for and review additional records. This is by no means intended to be an exhaustive line-by-line response to the Committee's letter. It is provided, however, to demonstrate the Department's good faith compliance with oversight requests from the Committee. Furthermore, your letter erroneously includes several requests to which you allege you have not received a response, when in fact material has already been produced. The Department will gladly direct your staff to those productions at a time that is convenient for them. The Department continues to identify and review records responsive to the Committee's requests and to prioritize based on compulsory processes, conversations with Committee staff, and dates of requests. DHS staff remains willing and available to work with Committee staff on these priorities, with the recognition that staff capacity may have to be reallocated from other Committee requests, and that responses are subject to the limits described above. Thank you again for your letter. Should you wish to discuss this or any homeland security issue, please contact the DHS Office of Legislative Affairs, (202) 447-5890.

Thompson January 18, 2024 I'd like to start by thanking all of the witnesses for being here today to share their stories and expertise. Losing a loved one to drugs or violence is devastating, and our hearts go out to you and your families. I also want to make sure that the record is clear--Secretary Mayorkas informed the Majority last week of his scheduling conflict for today, and I am sorry if the Majority neglected to share that information with the witnesses. I also want to make very clear that Democrats are committed to enacting policies that will actually address these issues. Impeaching Secretary Mayorkas will do nothing to prevent other families from suffering similar tragedies. If only it were that simple. These problems are not new. They will require serious policy making, not an impeachment vote will do nothing but undermine our Constitutional system. If my Republican colleagues were serious about addressing these issues, they would be working on legislation, collaborating with our Senate counterparts and the White House. Right now, Congress has a pending request from President Biden to fund additional Border Patrol agents, additional law enforcement personnel, and increased fentanyl detection technology. House Republicans have refused to consider this request. Instead of pursuing solutions to these problems, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are chasing an illegitimate impeachment and using tragedy to score political points. This entire process has been conducted in bad faith with a predetermined outcome. It is clear from my earlier parliamentary inquiries that the Chairman has not established any due process or procedure for this sham of an impeachment. And the Majority has refused to work with the Department to find a day and time to hear from Secretary Mayorkas, despite his offer to do so. Let's not forget that my Republican colleagues forced their border bill, H.R. 2, through this committee without considering any Democratic input, resulting in a bill full of unworkable provisions that would create chaos on the Southwest Border. They know as well as anyone that H.R. 2 never had a chance of becoming law. Senate Republicans and Democrats are working together, in a bipartisan manner and with the direct involvement of Secretary Mayorkas, to try to fix the issues raised here today. Yet instead of joining that conversation and using the powers of the Congress to create change, House Republicans are pursuing a partisan impeachment effort that will achieve nothing. Perhaps this is because a bipartisan reform bill would take away a Republican political talking point. As one Republican Member told CNN earlier this month, he has no interest in trying to pass border legislation that might ``help Joe Biden's approval rating.'' And that's really what this impeachment sham is all about. A political game to make it seem like the do-nothing Republican caucus achieved something while attacking the Biden administration. It's the American people that are paying the price of Republican inaction. This impeachment hearing just distracts from the important work that DHS is doing to secure the border and enforce immigration laws, so let me share some of that work. From May to September 2023, DHS removed or returned at least 360,000 noncitizens from the United States, more than any other 5-month period in the last 10 years. From April 2022 to September 2023, DHS arrested nearly 17,000 suspected human smugglers and seized nearly $13 million in currency. And in fiscal year 2023 DHS stopped over 43,000 pounds of fentanyl from entering the country, resulting in over 5,600 arrests. President Biden has requested the necessary funding, but Republicans would rather shut down the entire Federal Government than give President Biden another win. Mr. Chairman, what other conclusion can the American people draw but that House Republicans don't actually want to fix the problems on our Southern Border? The Constitution gives Congress broad and expansive powers to create laws and shape the policies we want to see. It gives us strong tools to perform oversight over the execution of those policies. Yet that's not what we're seeing here today. Those real levers of power don't seem to be flashy enough for my Republican colleagues. They don't want to do the hard work of creating workable laws--of collaborating and compromising. It's far easier to demand impeachment. Instead of engaging in a good-faith effort to improve homeland security, House Republicans are more interested in giving interviews to FOX News. As Professor Pearlstein has explained today, there is no Constitutional basis for impeaching Secretary Mayorkas. We heard the same from Professor Bowman last week, and we've heard the same from the many other Constitutional law experts that have written our committee. There is a reason they have not brought a Constitutional expert to testify in support of this impeachment--there is no Constitutional basis for impeachment. Democrats will continue to keep our focus throughout this sham impeachment on what our obligations are under the Constitution. As I said last week, Mr. Chairman, when your Members are ready to get to work and to use the actual powers given to us by the Framers to address policy problems, I guarantee you House Democrats will do our best to work with you. But until then we will continue to call out this do-nothing approach.
