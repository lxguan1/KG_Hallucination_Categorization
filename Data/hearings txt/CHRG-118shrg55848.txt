ADDRESSING LONG COVID: ADVANCING RESEARCH AND IMPROVING PATIENT CARE ---------- Thursday, January 18, 2024 U.S. Senate, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:03 a.m., in room 430, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Bernard Sanders, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Sanders , Murray, Casey, Baldwin, Kaine, Hassan, Smith, Lujan, Hickenlooper, Markey, Cassidy, Murkowski, Braun, Marshall, and Romney. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR SANDERS The Chair. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions will come to order. Today, in my view, we are going to be talking about an issue that has not gotten the attention that it deserves from the medical community, from the media, and certainly from Members of Congress, and that is the crisis of long COVID. Long COVID, as we all know, is the fact that after people get COVID, sometimes there are symptoms which simply do not disappear. And we are going to hear from our panelists in a moment about that. What I would like to say to our panelists--and by the way, we have a full house here. We have an overflow room over there, and I suspect a lot of folks are watching this on TV and on livestream. I think there is the sense that something is going on in America which is serious that we are not addressing. I just want to say to our panelists and all those who are dealing with long COVID, we hear what you are experiencing. We take it seriously. We think we have not, as a Congress, done anywhere near enough, and we hope to turn that around. The reality is we are going to hear from our panelists for a moment, is that long COVID is a very serious illness that can have devastating consequences for those who contract it in America today. And it is--the estimate is that some 16 million people throughout our Country have long COVID. It affects people of all ages and all backgrounds. And we are going to hear a little bit of evidence that it disproportionately impacts people of color and lower income people. For too many--far too many people who were previously healthy, and we are going to hear from a former athlete this morning, who are leading active and productive lives, they have suddenly found themselves bedridden and grappling with strange, debilitating systems that they could not conceive of ever having gotten as a result of long COVID. The truth of the matter is, and we will hear from our experts after we hear from the patients, that we still don't know why. We don't know the cause of the disease. But this is what we do know. We know that long COVID can include more than 200 symptoms, including serious cognitive impairment and severe cardiovascular and neurological problems that can continue for weeks, months, or even years after initial infection. We know that people with long COVID have experienced a wide variety of chronic symptoms, including extreme fatigue, insomnia, migraines, brain fog, dizziness, shortness of breath, loss of smell or taste, and sometimes those diseases can be so debilitating that it leads literally to suicide. This case in my own state, where a young man, previously healthy, committed suicide as a result. So let us be clear, the symptoms of long COVID are not minor inconveniences. They are debilitating conditions that affect the ability of people to work, to care for their families, and to live full lives. And here is what far too many do not know. Long COVID, and we are going to hear more about this, this morning, can affect anybody who has had COVID-19, from those who experienced mild symptoms to those who are severely ill. Further, although you may not have long COVID after your first infection, each reinfection can increase the risk of developing it. In other words, if you are under the impression that once you have gotten COVID, you don't need to worry about it ever again, you are mistaken. This is an escalating danger, particularly for those who have suffered repeated infections. It poses a severe threat to public health, and it demands our immediate and focused attention. Now let's be clear, the impact of long COVID is not just a health issue, it is an economic one as well. It is estimated that as many as 4 million Americans are out of work due to long COVID. The annual cost of those lost wages alone is around $170 billion a year. So, what should we do about it? First, we must educate medical professionals on how to adequately diagnose long COVID, better understand the risks associated with it, and identify potential therapeutic options. Far too many patients, and I think we are going to hear a lot about this morning, with long COVID have struggled to get their symptoms taken seriously, and far too many medical professionals have either dismissed or misdiagnosing their serious health problems. This crisis is made even worse by the fact that long COVID patients often require multiple specialists to treat their complex symptoms. The existing shortage of health care providers, from primary care to mental health providers, means that far too many Americans are unable to access affordable, high quality care when they need it. That is another issue that some of us hope we can address in the near future. So let me just conclude by thanking our panelists, both the patients and the experts who we will be hearing from in a moment. And let me give the mic over to Senator Cassidy. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CASSIDY Senator Cassidy. Thank you, Chair Sanders. You know, I am a doctor, and I worked for a long time with people who had chronic fatigue syndrome, or other things which are just difficult to put your finger on, this is my problem. The frustration they had with real symptoms but without real test findings was just remarkable. And so, when I hear of long COVID, you have not my sympathy, my empathy. My understanding that this is something which can be devastating for someone. They feel like there is something out of their control dictating their life. I thank you for being here. I thank you for sharing your story. And for the researchers, I thank you for doing that research. Some of what I say will just be an echo of that which Senator Sanders says, because the facts are the facts. You know, most folks with COVID recover, but there is this subset which does not. Again, thank you for representing them. And we know that long COVID sometimes ends. That is the hope there, that there is not necessarily perpetual long COVID. But for some, it is. And again, that is the challenge that we have before us. So, let's get the research better. Let's do what we can so that those who have it, somehow it does end. By the way, my own kind of episode of it is that after having COVID, I could really smell ammonia, and I would walk into a hospital where they were using it to clean a place, and whoa, it just powered me. I hope you don't mind me saying this, but when my dog urinated, I could really smell that urine. It was just something that was just so acute. But fortunately, that has kind of waned away and now it's much less than it used to be, but it still comes back as just a reminder, and that reminder tells me of that which you who have these symptoms more severely, just how you might experience that. So, what are we doing? Well, Congress, I am glad to say, has put significant funding toward this. We gave the Department of Health and Human Services $1 billion to study long COVID. And last summer, this Committee included a policy that would give further direction to HHS's long COVID research as part of the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act, which we call PAHPA, the reauthorization. Now, we know, we are about to hear, NIH has received criticism about the effectiveness of their long COVID research program. The Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery, or the Recover Initiative, and that is why Congress needs to reauthorize PAHPA. That gives us the ability to give not just money but oversight as to how these programs are being conducted. Today, we are going to hear from some of our non-Federal partners working on Recover and other HHS funded projects to better understand how that work is going, what opportunities are there, what else can Congress do. We are also going to hear from patients and from the mother of a patient, as regards to your long--about your long COVID experience and allowing that to illuminate the conversations that we will be having. I thank you for being here. I thank the Committee for examining--and, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. The Chair. Thank you, Senator Cassidy.  The Chair. Okay. All right----  The Chair. Okay. Let me begin by introducing our first witness, who is Ms. Angela Vazquez from Los Angeles. Ms. Vazquez is an individual with long COVID and the Policy Director for the Children's Partnership, a nonprofit organization that advocates for children's health equity. She has advocated for the long COVID patient community since early in the pandemic. Ms. Vazquez, thanks very much for being with us. STATEMENT OF ANGELA MERIQUEZ VAZQUEZ, M.S.W., LONG COVID PATIENT, LOS ANGELES, CA Ms. Vazquez. Thank you, Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and Members of the Committee for having me here today. My name is Angela Meriquez Vazquez, and today I am here to speak as a disabled former athlete, long COVID patient, and former president of Body Politic, the grassroots, patient led health justice organization that was at the forefront of long COVID advocacy. Before we had to close due to a lack of funding, we connected and supported over 15,000 long COVID patients worldwide, the vast majority of whom were from the U.S. Before getting COVID-19 in Los Angeles in March 2020, I was a healthy runner for nearly two decades. What started as a mild illness progressed over weeks with an increasingly scary set of symptoms, including severe levels of blood clots, a series of mini strokes, extreme confusion and numbness in my face, hands, and legs that progressed to an inability to walk for several days, and new onset allergic anaphylaxis after every meal. I had many clinical signs that something was wrong within weeks, high markers for an autoimmune disease, labs that showed my blood was severely clotted, markers of an over activated and exhausted immune system. All were dismissed by doctors as anxiety, but now are being verified by the decades long overdue research as clear evidence of infection related pathology. I was left to fend for myself from bed that first year because I did not fit the profile of who is considered high risk. There wasn't even acknowledgment that infections could trigger chronic disease, something I knew when I first got sick since I have a friend who has lived with chronic Lyme for years. I was a young person of color, not elderly and white. Now, even the CDC data shows that Latina and LGBTQ+ communities are currently experiencing the highest levels of long COVID in the U.S., and there is strong evidence that people of color are not prescribed antivirals like Paxlovid at the same rate as white people. The medical neglect and discrimination I faced contributed to my current level of disability and continues to harm patients like me. With long COVID, I have several chronic diseases, including myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome or ME/CFS. It is a neuroimmune condition whose hallmark symptom is post exertion symptom exacerbation or post exertion malaise, which means when I push myself past a dynamic threshold, I will experience a relapse of my worst symptoms like insomnia, brain fog, and confusion, sleep apnea, heart palpitations, fevers, and severe migraines. I am on 12 different prescription medications, including weekly IV treatments at the hospital. I have a strict pacing regimen that allows me to work from home but not do much else. I don't socialize, I don't enjoy my old hobbies, and I don't really leave my home, especially now that I am considered high risk. I am actually on the mild end of disability and now have access to a lot of medical support. Patients who have had me ME/CFS for decades guided me to the right specialists who are familiar with infection triggered diseases like dysautonomia, mast cell activation syndrome, and ME/CFS, and how to manage them. My employer has been supportive in accommodating my needs, like frequent breaks and working from home where I can work while laying down. Low income and patients of color who are more likely to get COVID-19, long COVID, and have the least access to health care, are likely experiencing the greatest levels of disability and medical neglect, and largely remain unidentified or unsupported with their new disabilities by the health care system, employers, and schools. Having insurance doesn't necessarily guarantee access to care. Long COVID patients with managed care plans especially are at the mercy of overwhelmed primary care doctors unfamiliar with infection triggered sequelae who gatekeep access to specialists who can diagnose and manage the known pathologies. I recently had to assist a colleague, a health access lawyer, navigate her own HMO to get her son a long COVID dysautonomia diagnosis after 2 years of constant symptoms. There is also an escalating health access crisis with the return of Medicaid eligibility redetermination this year. Having to prove that you are still poor is a time consuming, stressful, and bureaucratic process that contributes to millions of otherwise eligible people losing their health insurance because of application errors or mis-notifications. Hundreds of thousands of disabled long COVID patients are now--are new Medicaid recipients who may have moved or--due to their financial or employment changes, or they may simply be too ill to understand and fill out the forms as I have been during relapse. My insurance keeps me stable enough to work, and I need to work to keep my insurance, a horrible double bind. We are living through the largest mass disabling event in modern history. Not since the emergence of AIDS has there been such an imperative for large scale change in health care, public health, and inequitable structures that bring exceptional risks of illness, suffering disability and mortality. COVID-19 is but the most recent driver of a known phenomenon of post-viral illnesses that cluster around a set of understudied, complex chronic diseases, and that are compounded for marginalized communities by social drivers of health. With enough political will, we can fund a long COVID moonshot that transforms clinical and community care for all of us. Thank you.  prepared statement of angela meriquez vazquez My name is Angela Meriquez Vazquez and today I am here to speak as a disabled former athlete, Long COVID patient, and former President of Body Politic, the grassroots patient-led virtual community health organization that was at the forefront of Long COVID advocacy. Before we had to close due to a lack of funding, we connected and supported over 15,000 Long COVID patients worldwide, the vast majority of whom were from the U.S. Before getting COVID19 in Los Angeles in March 2020, I was a runner for nearly two decades. What started as a mild illness progressed over weeks with an increasingly scary set of symptoms, including severe levels of blood clots, a series of mini strokes, brain swelling, seizures, painful heart palpitations, severe shortness of breath, extreme confusion, and numbness in my face, hands, and legs that progressed to an inability to walk for several days, and new onset of allergic anaphylaxis after every meal. I had many clinical signs that something was wrong within weeks--high markers for an autoimmune disease, labs that showed my blood was severely clotted, markers of an exhausted immune system. All were dismissed by doctors as anxiety, but now are being verified by overdue and still underfunded research as clear evidence of Long COVID and infection-related pathology. I was left to fend for myself from bed that first year, because I did not fit the profile of who was considered high-risk.

The medical neglect and discrimination I faced contributed to my current level of disability and continues to harm patients like me. With Long COVID, I have several chronic diseases, including myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), also known as chronic fatigue syndrome or ME/ CFS. It is a neuroimmune disease whose hallmark symptom is post exertional symptom exacerbation or post-exertion malaise, which means when I push myself past a dynamic threshold, I will experience a relapse of my worst symptoms like insomnia, brain fog and confusion, sleep apnea, heart palpitations, fevers, and severe migraines. I'm on 12 different prescription medications, including weekly IV treatments at the hospital. I have a strict pacing regimen that allows me to work from home, but not do much else. I do not socialize, or enjoy my old hobbies, and I don't really leave my home, especially now that I am now considered high-risk. Though we were recently vaccinated, my spouse and I were reinfected with COVID over Christmas--I am here today despite my Long COVID and new autoimmune disease flaring, and I am risking permanent worsening of my MECFS from the exertion. I am on the mild end of disability and now have access to a lot of medical support. Patients who have had MECFS for decades guided me to the right specialists familiar with the historic research on infection triggered diseases like Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), and ME/CFS and how to manage them. Patients of color's access to benefits, and diagnostic and supportive healthcare, is nonexistent because Long COVID was not even a diagnosable condition until nearly 2 years into the pandemic, despite the medical research that has existed, though limited, to guide clinicians in managing infection-triggered diseases. Low-income, immigrant, and patients of color who are more likely to get COVID-19, Long COVID, and have the least access to healthcare, are likely experiencing the greatest levels of disability and medical neglect and largely remain unidentified or unsupported with their new disabilities by the healthcare system, employers, and schools. Unlike me, at least half to nearly two-thirds of surveyed Long COVID patients could not work full-time, according to research conducted by the Patient Led Research Collaborative, a group of patients with Long COVID that started their peer-reviewed research through our Body Politic support group. Many patients like me experience deep fatigue along with neurological and cognitive symptoms that make it difficult to drive, make decisions, remember instructions, follow conversations, and plan ahead. The Brookings Institution estimated that 1.6 million workers are out of the workforce due to Long COVID, which represents an astounding majority of the estimated 2.2 million people that the labor force is missing from its pre-pandemic size. As we speak, the return of Medicaid eligibility redetermination as a result of the Federal Public Health Emergency unwinding is creating an escalating health crisis for Long COVID patients. Having to prove that you are still poor is a time-consuming, stressful, and bureaucratic process that contributes to millions of otherwise eligible households losing their health insurance because of application errors or missed notifications. This process was wisely stopped during the first 3 years of the crisis in the interest of preserving healthcare access for vulnerable groups. Hundreds of thousands of disabled Long COVID patients are likely to be new Medicaid recipients who are unfamiliar with the process. They may have moved due to their shifting financial situation and employment and thus may have missed notices sent by mail. Or, they may be simply too ill, like I have been during relapses, to understand and complete the process on their own. If they lose their health insurance, they will inevitably become sicker and almost certainly become poorer. We are living through what is likely to be the largest mass disabling event in modern history. Not since the emergence of the AIDS pandemic has there been such an imperative for large-scale change in healthcare, public health, and inequitable structures that bring exceptional risks of illness, suffering, disability, and mortality.

Our next witness will be Mrs. Rachel Beale, and she will be recognized by Senator Kaine of Virginia. Senator Kaine. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I so appreciate this hearing. I will actually introduce both Ms. Beale and Ms. Heim, both from Virginia. The next witness will be Rachel Beale from Southampton County, Virginia, in the Southeastern part of our state. Rachel was previously the Director of Human Relations at the Paul D. Camp Community College. She is a wife and mother to three children. Her husband, Steve, is here with her. Last year, she joined me at a long COVID summit that I hosted in Richmond, Virginia. The summit brought together patients and providers to discuss ways to improve patient centered care. Rachel has been living with long COVID for almost 3 years, and her story is one that is very focused upon the tremendous challenges of maintaining work with long COVID, and also the tremendous challenges of negotiating the Social Security disability insurance system with long COVID. After Ms. Beale testifies, the next witness will be Nicole Heim from Winchester, Virginia. Nicole is the mother of three children and is here on behalf of her 16 year old daughter, who has long COVID. Nicole will share with us her journey navigating the health care system and the education system as the parent of a child with long COVID, one that is so significantly challenging that it even required the family to move in order to be able to get the health care that their daughter needs. With that, Ms. Beale, please, we are glad to have you. We are open--we are now open for your testimony. Then Ms. Heim, you can follow. STATEMENT OF RACHEL BEALE, M.B.A., LONG COVID PATIENT, SOUTHAMPTON COUNTY, VA Ms. Beale. Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me here to testify. It is an honor to be here. My name is Rachel Beale, and I live in Sedley, a small town in Southeastern Virginia. I live with my husband, Steven, who is here with me today, and my daughter and two sons. I tested positive for COVID on March 17th, 2021. I was sick with COVID for 2 weeks. I had a high fever and intense body aches. Although I didn't feel well, I managed my COVID at home. After the fever went away, I tried to return to my normal life. I worked as a human resources director at our local community college. I loved my job but soon realized I was struggling. Even after my initial COVID infection, I continued to experience extreme fatigue, chronic pain, and neurological issues, to name a few. Before COVID, I was very healthy. I didn't expect to have problems recovering. When I realized I was struggling, I visited my primary care doctor. My doctor told me I needed more time to recover. I was stunned when he took me out of work for 2 weeks. I was very stressed about missing more work and worried that I would fall behind, but 2 weeks turned into two more weeks, and eventually my doctor diagnosed me with long COVID in May 2021. I was lucky to have a primary care doctor that believed me and believed my symptoms. I know not every person with long COVID has that same experience. My long COVID symptoms persisted beyond May 2021. I tried to go back to work part time, but I just couldn't do it. For the first 6 months of my illness, I was on short term disability. I tried over and over to work, but I could only manage an hour before I would start getting headaches and feel sick. Six months after I was diagnosed with COVID, I was transitioned to long term disability and at this point I was separated from my job. As someone who has helped countless employees on short term disability and has transitioned some to long term disability, I knew this would happen to me. I used to have the very same meetings with employees, but there is nothing that prepares you to hear the words that you no longer have a job. I loved my position at the college. I loved my career in human resources. Having to stop working because of my health has been devastating. I had a very full life before I got sick. Long COVID has affected every part of my life now. I wake up every day feeling tired, nauseous, and dizzy. I immediately start planning when I can lay down again. There are many days when I sleep all day, and on my good days I get 2 to 3 hours of energy. I have had most of the symptoms of long COVID. The fatigue and chronic pain are the hardest to manage. It can be debilitating. I also have neurological issues. The executive functioning part of my brain seems to be affected the most. Being sick for so long has made my depression and anxiety worse. I have had low times, and when I don't feel good, I get depressed. I was just diagnosed with fibromyalgia, triggered by long COVID, yet another illness for which there is no cure. In December 2021, I filed my initial application for Social Security disability insurance. I have been denied twice. I am now waiting for hearing date with administrative law judge. Long COVID is recognized by the Americans with Disabilities Act. It should be easier for someone with long COVID to be approved for SSDI. I am very fortunate that I have a supportive family. My husband has good health insurance. My doctors, procedures, most of my therapy is covered and I am thankful for that. However, the co-pays add up and sometimes we can't pay them on time. My kids have grown accustomed to me being sick. We plan things around how I feel and my energy level. If there is something coming up like a birthday or holiday, I try to get as much rest as I can before the event. I know that I will have a crash for the next few days after, and I won't be able to do much but sleep. Sometimes it takes several weeks for me to get back to my baseline. For example, coming to testify today has been a huge effort, and I know that I will need several days to recover. We have gotten used to this lifestyle and living within my physical limitations. When I think about what comes next, I just don't know. Full recovery seems out of reach for me. I have been sick for almost 3 years, and it feels like there hasn't been much progress in long COVID research. I hope that Congress can help with that to move the research forward. But for now, I am trying to make peace with this--with my situation. It makes me sad to think about my future. This may be as healthy as I get.  prepared statement of rachel beale Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me to testify today.

STATEMENT OF NICOLE HEIM, PARENT OF LONG COVID PATIENT, WINCHESTER, VA Ms. Heim. Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, Members of the Committee, thank you for the invitation to testify today on this important issue. My name is Nicole Heim and my 16 year old daughter has long COVID. In this room alone, I am sure there are countless stories about the impact of long COVID, but one story that is rarely shared is that of our children and the devastating physical and mental long term effects it has. My daughter is just one example, and I am here to share her story in the hopes that it may help other families. In September 2021, my daughter, 14 years old at the time, contracted COVID. Before COVID, she was a relatively healthy, typical teenage girl, excelling at school with a robust social life. A month following her recovery, I received a panic phone call from the school nurse saying my child was short of breath, her pulse was extremely high, and her arms and legs were locked in place. This is the kind of phone call no parent ever wants to receive. After seeing she was hypoxic, low blood oxygen, at the local E.R. they transferred her via ambulance 3 hours away to a larger hospital where she was admitted and received a long COVID diagnosis. Following this diagnosis, we were fortunate to be introduced to and get into the long COVID clinic at Children's National Hospital here in Washington, DC. After a few months of waiting and jumping through prior authorization hoops with Medicaid, we were able to begin seeing Dr. Alexandra Yonts, the late lead infectious disease doctor at Children's who coordinates the team, which includes multiple specialists. At the time of our initial visit with them, my daughter was experiencing a wide range of symptoms, including extreme fatigue, low blood pressure, increased heart rate, severe joint pain, daily nausea and vomiting, severe brain fog, depression, and more. We learned about and enrolled in the joint Children's National and NIH Pediatric COVID Outcomes Study, led by Doctor Roberta DeBiasi. This is the only study of its kind in the country where 1,000 children are evaluated for 3 years following enrollment to determine long term effects on children with COVID infection. Long COVID stripped away my daughter's life as she knew it. She was a straight-A honor student, an active member of the school's marching band, and had an active friend group. Now she is isolated and struggles to do her schoolwork. Because of the severity of her symptoms, she is no longer able to physically participate in the marching band or go to school. Instead of looking forward to a high school graduation, my 16 year old is working slowly on her GED from home. The mild depression and anxiety she struggled with prior to COVID has only been intensified and has led to increased panic attacks and hospitalization for suicidal ideations. We so frequently hear about the physical effects of long COVID. Unfortunately, we rarely discuss the mental health impact it has. It is especially concerning when considering our children. Having a chronic illness as an adult is difficult, but it is more challenging and takes a greater toll, a much greater toll on a child. So much of our children's lives revolve around school, extracurricular activities, sports, and friends, activities that continue for my daughter's peers but not for her. After 2 years of treatment, my daughter has seen some symptom improvement. However, we are still experiencing symptoms and struggling each day to adjust to this new norm. We are learning more and more every day. In fact, we recently discovered she has micro-blood clots which will require her to be on daily blood thinners. We are optimistic that she will fully recover 1 day, but we remain concerned that her current treatment regimen may be necessary for the rest of her life. Clinics and studies like these done--like those done at Children's are crucial to understanding this infection and its unique impact on our children. I feel so grateful for the treatment my daughter is receiving at Children's, but I know there are many other parents and children struggling not only with the long COVID diagnosis, but also to find symptom relief. In reflecting on our experience, my recommendations to this Committee are simple. Create medical screening tools to help identify long COVID. Increase awareness around pediatric long COVID. Allow physicians caring for long COVID patients to have telemedicine appointments in states they are not licensed in, for both the initial visits and for follow-up. Encourage the Committee to meet with the hospitals that are running the long COVID clinics to understand the level of services that they provide. I would tell any parent that if their child's existing conditions worsen or they develop persistent and or new symptoms after COVID, they should contact their doctor to discuss long COVID. I look forward to a day when doctors not only know more about long COVID but can also quickly identify patients to provide timely treatment. I hope studies like these at Children's National Hospital are continually supported to lead new treatment options for patients like my daughter. I would like to offer myself as a resource to this Committee and our health care system as we continue to address long COVID. Thank you for the opportunity to share our story. I look forward to our discussion.  prepared statement of nicole heim Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, Members of the Committee Thank you for the invitation to testify today on this important issue. My name is Nicole Heim and my 16-year-old daughter has Long COVID. In this room alone, I am sure there are countless stories about the impact of a COVID diagnosis. But one story that is rarely shared is that of our children and the devastating physical and mental long-term effects of this virus. My daughter is just one example, and I am here to share her story in the hopes that it may help other families. In September 2021, my daughter, 14-years-old at the time, contracted COVID after an exposure in band class. Before COVID, she was a relatively healthy, typical teenage girl, excelling at school with a robust social life. She was diagnosed earlier in her adolescence with POTS, Posterior Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, in which she experienced an abnormal and elevated heart rate. Her COVID diagnosis only exacerbated this issue and we saw her heart rate increase after walking up a flight of stairs from 177bpm before COVID to 208bpm after COVID. Her COVID symptoms were extensive, and she was very sick, but thankfully not hospitalized. A month following her recovery, I received a panicked phone call from the school nurse saying my child was short of breath, her pulse was extremely high, and she was unable to move her arms and legs. This is the kind of phone call no parent is ever prepared to receive. At the time, we lived in Charles Town, WV, so I rushed her to the local ER where she was diagnosed with hypoxia with low blood oxygen. She was transferred via ambulance 3 hours away to Ruby Memorial in Morgantown, WV, where she received a Long COVID diagnosis. Following this diagnosis, we were fortunate to be introduced to the team at Children's National Hospital here in Washington, DC. While waiting to receive care at Children's pediatric Long COVID clinic, my daughter's testing and blood work continued. After many months of waiting and jumping through prior authorization hoops with Medicaid, my daughter gained access to the wide network of specialty doctors in the Long COVID clinic led by Dr. Alexandra Yonts, the lead infectious disease doctor at Children's. She coordinates the clinic and team that provides my daughter with care. At the time of our initial visit with Children's, my daughter was experiencing a wide range of symptoms, including extreme fatigue, low blood pressure, increased heart rate, rapid weight loss due to daily nausea and vomiting, severe brain fog, and depression. As patients of the Long COVID clinic, we learned about and enrolled in the joint Children's National and NIH Pediatric COVID Outcomes study, led by Dr. Roberta DeBiasi. This is the only study of its kind in the country, where one thousand children are evaluated for 3 years following enrollment to determine long term effects of a COVID infection. Long COVID took my straight ``A'' honors student, talented flautist, and member of the school's marching band with an active friend group and stripped her of life as we knew it. Because of the severity of her symptoms, she is no longer able to physically participate in the marching band and is now homeschooled full-time. Instead of looking forward to a high school graduation, my 16-year-old is working slowly on her GED from home. The mild depression and anxiety she struggled with prior to COVID has only been intensified and has led to increased panic attacks and hospitalization for suicidal ideations. We so frequently hear about the physical effects of Long COVID. Without a doubt it significantly impacted my daughter's life. Unfortunately, we rarely discuss the mental health impact of COVID. It is especially concerning when considering our children. Having a chronic illness as an adult is difficult, but it's more challenging and takes a much greater toll as a child. So much of our children's lives revolve around school, extracurricular activities, sports, and friends--activities that continue for my daughter's peers but are no longer a part of her normal life. After 2 years with Children's, and through extensive testing and blood work, physical therapy, supplements, and daily medications, her GI symptoms, stamina, heart condition, and brain fog are manageable and under control. Although my daughter has improved, we are still experiencing new symptoms and struggling each day to adjust to this new norm, including a recent discovery that she has micro clots which now requires her to be on daily blood thinners. We are optimistic that she will fully recover 1 day but remain concerned that her current treatment regimen may be necessary for the rest of her life. Clinics and studies like those done at Children's are crucial to understanding this infection and its unique impact on our children. Unfortunately, fewer than a dozen pediatric Long COVID clinics exist across the country to help affected children. Children's National's approach is unique in that each pediatric patient meets with their whole team of specialists back-to-back during a single coordinated clinic visit. But I have heard other clinics focus just on rehab or pulmonology. I would urge the Committee to meet with the hospitals running Long COVID clinics to better understand the level of services they provide. With increased research, I am confident that treatments can be found. I feel so grateful for the treatment my daughter is receiving at Children's, but I know there are many other parents and children struggling, not only with the Long COVID diagnosis but also to find some symptom relief. In reflecting on our experience, my recommendation to this Committee and our health care system is simple--do more to increase awareness around pediatric Long COVID. My daughter had many medical appointments and interacted with many providers before receiving a diagnosis. I believe this contributed to the severity of her symptoms and a delay in appropriate treatment. Like medical screening tools used for depression and suicidal ideations, there should also be a screening protocol for providers and patients to help identify Long COVID. I would tell any parent today that if their child's existing conditions worsen or they develop persistent and/or new symptoms after COVID, they should contact their doctor to discuss Long COVID. We should also allow physicians caring for Long COVID patients to have telemedicine appointments in states that they are not licensed in for both initial visits and for follow-up visits. This is very important because most states do not have a pediatric Long COIVD clinic. And even in areas where there is a Long COVID clinic, families like mine have to travel for several hours to make appointments. Finally, my daughter's care was partially delayed because of the long prior authorization requirements of our state's Medicaid program. If there were less hurdles like these, it would help patients get to clinics faster. I look forward to a day when doctors not only know more about Long COVID but can also quickly identify patients to provide timely treatment. I hope studies, like those at Children's National Hospital, are continually supported to lead to new treatment options for patients like my daughter. Thank you for the opportunity to share our story, I've done so in the hopes that it can help many other families, and I'd like to offer myself as a resource to this Committee and our health care system as we continue to address Long COVID. I look forward to our discussion today. Addendum: I have included attachments to my testimony to further inform the Committee of all the ways children are being affected by Long COVID.

Well, I think I speak for the whole Committee in thanking all three of you for being here and for educating us and the American people about what you, and in your case your child has experienced. Let me begin my questioning with Ms. Vazquez. I know you have experienced obviously not only with yourself, but you have interacted with many, many hundreds of people with long COVID. Is one of the frustrations that the medical community or others do not believe, in fact, what you are experiencing? Is that one of the problems that you are going through? Ms. Vazquez. Yes, absolutely. I--daily, it seems like I hear from patients who have been experiencing long COVID symptoms that are clearly as a result of their infection with COVID, being dismissed by doctors as anxiety, as pandemic stress. It is, I think, quite alarming that even with the media attention that it has gotten and then all of the grassroots advocacy that we have done to educate providers and the community about long COVID, it is not enough. There really needs to be, I think, a stronger, louder, Government campaign around long COVID for public health, and as well as clinical education to providers, particularly primary care. I mean, you said yourself that primary care is overwhelmed. You--it is really, really difficult to assess a patient in 15 minutes and get them everything they need. The Chair. Let me jump to, Ms. Beale and Ms. Heim just to pick up where Ms. Vazquez left off. How has your--how--what kind of impact--what kind of effect have you had in terms of reaching out to the medical community? Have you found doctors understanding of the problem? Have you been able to get the help you need, Ms. Beale, for your symptoms? Are others in a similar place? Ms. Beale. Thank you so much for your question, Senator. Early on in my long COVID journey, it was difficult to find a doctor that knew what long COVID was. I even had a doctor tell me that she didn't believe that long COVID was real. That is hard when you are sick and you know it is real, and you have a medical professional telling you that they don't believe it. It is hard to get anything out of a conversation like that. I have become more selective in which physicians I see. I ask every single one of them, have you heard of long COVID? Are you treating any other patients with long COVID? I think that last year more of the providers are more aware of long COVID. So that has been very helpful. The Chair. Good. Ms. Heim, you have introduced us to something I think has less attention than the overall crisis of long COVID, and that is how it impacts young people. I guess you have, not by choice, become somewhat of an expert on COVID in young people. Can you tell us a little bit about what you have learned as to how many kids are experiencing long COVID, whether they are getting the kind of treatment that they need, how it impacts a teenager's life? Speak into the mic there, please. Ms. Heim. Just being on social media and connecting with all these different groups of parents, a lot of times you get to talk directly with other parents and hear their stories, and there is a lot of parents that are struggling to get treatment for their children. I mean, they are trying all kinds of different medications, supplements, even hyperbaric chambers. I mean, they are doing anything to try and help their children feel better. I think the biggest thing in relation to the question about the doctors I come across--the doctors I have been around are not dismissive. They just say, I don't know. I hear that a lot from doctors. I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. So, what I do is because I have got the information from the clinic and the study and stuff, I tell them what I know. I was at the gastroenterologist yesterday and I said, did you know COVID lives in your gut for months after infection? She said, no, I didn't know that. I said, well, tell everybody at your office.  Ms. Heim. Then she looked at me and she said--yes, well, she----  Ms. Heim. She looked at me and she said, well, how do I do that test? I don't even know how to order that test to see if they have COVID in their stool. I think that is part of the problem, is the doctors need the information so that they can help the patients because they just don't know that COVID is doing this to people, I don't think. They are shocked usually when I tell them the stuff that I have learned. The Chair. All right. I am running out of time. My last question is, what good question did I not ask any of you?  The Chair. All right, Ms. Vazquez---- Ms. Vazquez. Yes. I think the--a question that I would have liked to have answered is why it is important to include patients in research and education for clinicians and providers. I think we have been living this. We have been living with long COVID since the pandemic began. And patients have been living with infection associated chronic diseases for generations. We know this stuff backward and forwards, not only because we live it, but so many of us have had to do our own research. You know, I am heavily invested in PubMed and Google Scholar. I can read a paper. I send papers to my providers. We are experts from a lived experience and because some of us are getting in there, doing the research ourselves. So that is on why it is important to include us.  The Chair. See that? I knew I would ask a brilliant question, then it was you. Senator Cassidy. Senator Cassidy. I defer to Senator, Dr. Roger Marshall. Senator Marshall. Well, thank you, Chairman and Ranking Member again. And this is personal for me. One of my loved ones is one of those 16 million people that suffered from long COVID, incapacitated for some 2 years. People often ask me, well, what is long COVID? I think that we have some loose definitions, but it is--I tell people it is like if you had mono that never goes away. There is a brain fog. There is aches and pains. And sometimes the pains follow nerve tracks, the vagus nerve and the femoral nerve. Maybe it is a venous process and there is micro blood clots. Like you, we have taken my loved one to dozens of doctors. I have talked to 40, 50, 60, 80. I have read everything there is to read about long COVID. Talked to other Members of the Senate that have had long COVID, what are they doing. I share your frustration. I am frustrated that our CDC seems to be more focused on I guess vaccines than they are treatment for long COVID. I mean simple questions still have not been answered. If you take Paxlovid early on, even though you are young and healthy, does it help decrease the incidence of long COVID? I don't think we know the answer to that. Do vaccines increase or decrease the incidence of long COVID? If you have already had COVID, does the vaccine increase or decrease your risk of long COVID? You know, we don't know the answers. I couldn't be more frustrated that it is vaccines, vaccines, vaccines, rather than focused on diagnosis and treatment. I don't need epidemiology anymore. I need diagnosis and treatment. What blood tests should we be offering? What is the standard of care when a person has long COVID? What blood should we be ordering? Now, I am going to give you some hope though. I think in the past month, I have finally--talked to a couple physicians that get it. That understand it. Dr. Bob Redfield from the former CDC is one of those people that has dedicated his life now to figure out what is causing long COVID. I think they are getting closer, but I couldn't be more disappointed in what is coming out of the CDC right now. That they are not cooperating adequately enough with private doctors. Trust me, these doctors--we want to help. We want to help you, but we don't know--we don't have a cure for mono. We don't have cures for the flu. I am frustrated. And, Mr. Chairman, what I am really concerned about is more recent news coming from across the--from foreign lands that just recently learned that Dr. Lily Ren, 2 weeks before we knew what COVID was over here, was sequenced. That our own NIH--that she had submitted the DNA sequence for COVID to our own NIH on December 28th, but the NIH deleted it. That would have given us two more weeks to work toward a vaccine and curing--and preventing the problem. And then I find out she was on the Eco Health grant from NIH--our own American dollars. She was working for the American Government. She has the sequence, she gives it to us, and we delete it. Remember, it only took 2 days for Moderna to develop a vaccine. If we would have had the vaccine earlier--my point is, how many long COVID would we have prevented if we knew that this was person to person transmission, which the Chinese certainly did by then. If we would have known this is person to person transmission, that this came from a laboratory, that it was a superbug, maybe we could have prevented some of these 16 million people. It points out that we don't have a good grasp of our grants. We award these grants to people who are doing research, and we don't have a good grasp of what they are doing. I am even more concerned recently, again coming out of China, that their viral gain of function continues. This week, they found--they have made a COVID virus that attacks the brain more so than human lung cells and human veins. That is why we have called for a viral gain of function moratorium until we can wrap our arms around this horrible situation. Who here can say the benefits of the virus that looks like COVID, that attacks the brain more over any other cells--what are the benefits of that type of research? People just can't show me what the benefits that are. I guess my question for you all--and I think it goes to the mental health of my patients, my family members, the people I talked to. If we knew where COVID came from and what are we doing to prevent it? Ms. Heim, is it your daughter or your son, I am sorry---- Ms. Heim. Daughter---- Senator Marshall. Your daughter. You know, the mental-- her--this is definitely a mental health impact on people as well. Are you frustrated with the CDC that we don't have better research out there, diagnosis, treatment? Are you frustrated that we are not doing more to stop this next round of COVID from coming? Ms. Heim. I just want them to do something about it now, going forward. And to acknowledge that it is real and how it is affecting their children. Senator Marshall. I get it. Thank you. Thank you so much, everybody. The Chair. Senator Murray. Senator Murray. Well, thank you very much, Chair Sanders. I am really glad we are having this really important hearing. I want to thank all of our witnesses for being here today. You know, since the COVID-19 pandemic, I have really been pressing for more NIH funding to help us better understand and treat long COVID. I continue to fight for strong funding bills for health research and public health infrastructure, as we are now negotiating our current funding bills. Last Congress, I fought very hard to pass my Prevent Pandemics Act to make sure that we would not be caught so unprepared for whatever the next pandemic hits. But there is a lot more that we need to do, as all of you well know. We need better information. We need better care. We need better treatment. We need better public awareness, to help with prevention. I know for patients dealing with this, long COVID is a serious, life altering condition, and one we are, as many of you just said, learning about every single day. I really appreciate all of you being here and sharing your stories. You know, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we know that women were likely to be exposed to COVID-19, frontline essential workers, our daycare workers, our nurses, and many of them living in underserved communities. Now, I believe in general that our Country needs to take women's health more seriously, so I think this question I have for you is extremely important. Given the barriers women already face in getting quality care, what are some of the unique challenges you all may have seen as women seeking care and treatment for long COVID complications? Ms. Vazquez, I will start with you. Ms. Vazquez. Yes, I absolutely believe my gender and my ethnicity played a role in not being able to get care, especially at the beginning of the pandemic when they--when hospitals were absolutely rationing care, even if it wasn't an official policy, I was told multiple times that unless I was elderly and in need of a ventilator, that I needed to go home and save beds for people who were really sick. This was after getting the labs showing that I was severely blood clotted. I was told that was a false positive and that I didn't actually need any care. I was sent home as a psych patient. And that continues to happen to women, especially women of color--Black women especially. I kept going back to the emergency room because I told myself I am not going to be a statistic. I think, unfortunately, those statistics are growing. Senator Murray. Ms. Beale. Ms. Beale. Thank you for your question, Senator. For me, early on, I did have a doctor that kept saying that it was just depression and anxiety. That is why I was achy. That is why I was tired. It is just depression. It is just anxiety, you know. Go see a therapist. Let's work on it from that angle. And that is very discouraging as a woman or any patient that it is all in my head. You know, I know it is not all in my head, but this doctor is trying to make me feel like it is all in my head and it is very discouraging. You know, there are--there were some instances where I requested some testing, and it was--there was a little bit of pushback on that and I think that was coming into play of the woman--being a woman and I guess kind of brushing me aside a little bit more. One of the things I needed was blood work to test my ferritin levels and the doctor kept testing just the iron but a separate test, and I found out that I was anemic. But if I hadn't kept pushing that with him, I wouldn't have come--I wouldn't have been able to get that conclusion. Senator Murray. Okay. Ms. Heim. Ms. Heim. I don't think that is something I can really speak on for my daughter. Senator Murray. Okay. Well, let me ask you about access because lot of patients with COVID, long COVID in my State of Washington have told me that they have really limited access to quality treatment and rehab services. The University of Washington's Post-COVID Rehab and Recovery Clinic is one of the few that we have in a very large state. I know you all have lived through the challenge of navigating our health care system. What do you want to see done at the Federal level to expand access to quality care for long COVID patients? Any of you? Ms. Vazquez. Ms. Vazquez. Yes. I really feel like we need to broadly disseminate sort of basic diagnostic and screening tools to, again, primary care physicians. They are the front line. They are the first person that folks go to after an infection with these somewhat nebulous symptoms. These conditions have existed. We have clinical diagnostic tools to be able to diagnose and then manage these conditions. That needs to be disseminated widely. I think there is also a role to play through HHS, and guidance to state Medicaid agencies to really hold contracted managed care plans accountable to identifying and treating long COVID adequately. Senator Murray. Okay. Very helpful. Either of you want to comment? I am out of time. I wanted to ask Ms. Heim very quickly. We know that the education system during COVID, a lot of kids suffered. We are still dealing with a lot of the significant impact of learning throughout that time. Your daughter is now--how are you educating her with long COVID? Is that a challenge still for parents? Ms. Heim. We had transitioned from in-person school to a homebound program, which most states have. But even that was too much for her to be able to do with the anxiety, the four core classes. They had tutors that would meet with them, but a lot of the teachers weren't cutting her any slack. They weren't giving her less work. They weren't sympathetic at all. Senator Murray. We are dealing with learning loss from COVID in general, and I think we need to highlight it with long COVID patients as well, especially young kids. So, thank you. The Chair. Senator Cassidy. Senator Cassidy. I will defer to Senator Braun. Senator Braun. Thank you. When I look at what we do here on this Committee, I think whatever the particular topic is, we need to weave it always into maybe a little broader discussion. When you look at COVID coming along, catching our Country by surprise the way it did, I think a big part of the trickiness of navigating through it was what is true and what isn't. How much transparency is there? I know in my own business that I ran, that I could only look back on in terms of what they were doing, we took it seriously. Just like we took health care seriously 15 years ago when I was sick and tired of a health care system that was telling us how lucky we were that our premiums are only going up 5 to 10 percent a year, along with zero transparency into the system. I think COVID, if you want to find a silver lining to it, shows you how when you really get into a predicament where it is just laced with uncertainty, novelty, and then you try to remediate it through a system that you know is not real good at taking care of the standard operating staff. No one should go broke in this country because they get sick or have a bad accident. I think most of us--thank you, and that should be something we all agree with. Then it gets down to what are you going to do about it? I want to highlight something that the Chair of the Committee and I are doing, and then the question will be around that as you navigated through your own complications with COVID. To me, when I wrestled with it 15 years ago, there was zero transparency. You basically hoped that your insurance plan was going to take care of it. You never found out the net result until 3 or 4 months later, when you opened the envelope up with trepidation to see how much it was going to cost you. That is no good. We have got a bill called Healthcare Transparency and Competition, all the things I have been talking about. There are bigger things working here in the U.S. Senate. And thank you, Chairman, for doing that alongside many of us that are interested in it. Let's start on the left side of the--down here. Tell me, once you got into your own predicament fighting COVID, was it easy dealing with the system itself when you were trying to see what your alternatives were? Could you actually quantify that into how much it was going to cost? And tell me what that was about? Ms. Vazquez. The costs of living with long COVID are high. I have an excellent employer based health plan, a PPO, and I still last year spent $4,000 out of pocket on medically necessary care. This was not alternative care or--they were things that were not covered that were denied by my health plan. And that is--that was for a variety of reasons. A lot of my medication needs to be compounded because I am allergic. Insurance does not cover compound medication easily. I spent hours, probably a total of 40 hours over a month, just trying to get one medication covered. So, there is a cost, there is a financial cost and a time cost. Senator Braun. Thank you. Ms. Beale. Ms. Beale. Yes. For me, the same thing with the cost. I have my co-pays that I pay for every specialist I see, and that really adds up. Also, I live in a small town about an hour away from most of my doctors, so I am having to drive everywhere to these appointments when my time would be better spent resting, instead of going everywhere to try to see the doctors. It is very frustrating for me. You know, with my medical insurance, I have to see my PCP to ask for referral. When I wanted to see a neurologist, I had to ask to go see a neurologist, or cardiologist, hematology. Every time I had to have a referral. And then you have to wait 6 months to get seen by the specialists, and all this time is going by, and you know what the issue is, but you can't get in front of the right doctor. That is all--that has been very frustrating. Insurance, when things aren't covered that you need, it is very demoralizing because you know you need it and it is out of your--you know, not in your own personal budget to cover it. One of the things that I need is massage therapy for my chronic pain, and I pay out of pocket, but I can't afford to go every week like I need to. I go maybe once a month. And that is something that helps people with long COVID. So why can't the insurance cover it? Senator Braun. Good question. Ms. Heim. Ms. Beale. Really frustrating. Ms. Heim. My experience is very different because my daughter is on Medicaid. So, what was going on with us was, well, first off, in order to get into Children's National, there is a lot of prior authorizations that needed to happen. I definitely feel for my doctor's office sometimes because of the hours that they put into getting in--getting us into some of these specialists. But part of the reason why we moved states was because we previously lived in West Virginia, and whenever I needed to see a specialist, which was a lot, we had to drive over 3 hours to go to the university to see a specialist. It was like a full time job getting her to all the appointments and the testing and all that stuff. So, that was really hard. Senator Braun. Well, I think you are all saying the same thing. We had a kind of broken system that lacks transparency, competition, and all of that. Again, this health care price transparency 2.0 addresses all of that. And until we get that, we are always going to be wrestling with issues like you have just described. Thank you. The Chair. Thank you, Senator Braun. Let me take a Chairman's privilege to pick up on a point that Senator Braun made. He and I agree with the diagnosis. We have the health care system, which is broken, which is dysfunctional. In my view, its main function is to make huge profits for the insurance companies and the drug companies. Meanwhile, our life expectancy is far lower than many other countries. We don't have enough doctors, nurses, mental health practitioners, pharmacists, you name it. We need a fundamental overhaul of our health care system with a Congress that is able to do it. Given the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies and big money interests, we will see. Senator Hassan. Senator Hassan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Ranking Member Cassidy, for this hearing. To the witnesses, thank you for being here today, because this is really, really important for us to hear and understand. And before I turn to my questions, I just want to highlight the long COVID research that is happening in New Hampshire and the need for consistent investments in this work. This is more for my colleagues than for the three witnesses. Patients in New Hampshire have benefited from the research and care happening at the Dartmouth Hospital Post- Acute COVID Syndrome Clinic. The clinic has received some Federal funding through NIH but additional funding to expand services for patients has been delayed because of uncertainty around consistent, long term Federal funding. We have to work in a bipartisan manner to come to an agreement on long term Government funding, including to ensure reliable research funding that supports millions of Americans who are experiencing long COVID. Now to my questions to the panel. Ms. Beale, I want to start with you. I want to--this is a follow-up on questions you have heard and discussions you have had with Senator Murray, and just now, Senator Braun. In New Hampshire, our clinic at Dartmouth Health is the only long COVID clinic in the state. The clinic is in the Upper Valley region of New Hampshire, and as a result, some patients may have to drive hours to get there. You have talked about the impact of long car rides on your condition, but it can be really hard for any patient, especially those experiencing symptoms of long COVID, to have to engage in that kind of travel. That is just one example of the barriers that patients face to accessing the care they need. But I just would like you to elaborate, what has it been like for you, with the symptoms you have, to have to make long trips for your care? Ms. Beale. Thank you for your question, Senator. There have been many times where I have wanted to cancel appointments because I am sick. I don't feel good or I have zero energy and my husband is at work. He can't take off work to drive me everywhere. You know, he is our only income. So, yes, there is plenty of times that I am driving to my appointments, and I am--just I am so sick. Then I get into the appointment, and I am in front of the doctor, and I don't always remember every single thing that I need to say. I forget the biggest symptom that I need to talk about, or I forget my questions and all I am thinking about is, gosh, I don't feel good. I just want to go back home. And it is hard. It is really hard. Senator Hassan. Yes. I think it speaks to not only the challenges of long COVID patients, but just generally whenever patients with chronic illness have to travel a long time---- Ms. Beale. Right. Senator Hassan. So that is why rural health care and having multiple places that can address various health care issues is so important. Ms. Vazquez, my office has heard from Granite Staters with long COVID who are facing difficulties accessing and affording the health care that they need, just as you have discussed. One study suggests that patients who experience conditions like long COVID and chronic fatigue syndrome could face an average of $9,000 annually in medical bills. Can you--you talked about your experience and the out-of- pocket payments you have needed to make. But from a policy perspective, what can we do to protect patients from these costs? What are the recommendations? I know you have been advocating on this front. Ms. Vazquez. Yes. I think, there absolutely needs to be Government funding for research, which takes place in clinics and in long COVID clinics. And additionally, there--we have to hold health plans and especially managed care plans accountable for adequately reimbursing for services like care coordination. If you are working with 10 different specialists---- Senator Hassan. Right. Ms. Vazquez . you are going to need a care coordinator. And these are services that, again, that health plans are required by law to provide, and they are not always doing that. Senator Hassan. Some of our oversight function could also come into play here as well. Ms. Vazquez. Yes. Senator Hassan. Finally, to Ms. Heim, the small team at New Hampshire's long COVID clinics serves around 60 new patients per month and hundreds of existing patients, and the rate of referrals to the clinic isn't slowing. About 6 percent of New Hampshire has long COVID. It is clear that patients need access to more medical providers who can recognize and treat long COVID. What would you like to see change in how providers understand and treat children with symptoms of long COVID? I know that is your particular area of expertise at this point. Ms. Heim. I would say just as we do a screening for depression with teenagers, let's say, why can't we do a write up that screens for long COVID? Senator Hassan. Yes. Ms. Heim. We cannot only have it at the doctor's office but put it online so people can access it. And then if they realize that this might be what is affecting them, they can get in contact with a specialist. Even have it accessible to the schools. Senator Hassan. Yes. Ms. Heim. If they have a child that is coming into the school counselor's office or missing a lot of school, it might raise a red flag and they can just put a document in front of them and that could start the process. And then of course, telling the doctors what is going on, just giving them information we already have. Senator Hassan. Yes. Ms. Heim. I mean, I know so much just after the past couple of years, and I tell every doctor I see, but that is not going to make much of an impact. So why not get it out there to everybody what we know already. Senator Hassan. Right. Well, I appreciate that. And it strikes me that interacting with school nurses and getting school nurses engaged in this is one way to make sure that the schools have that information, from the viewpoint of a health care professional. I appreciate that. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. The Chair. Senator Cassidy. Senator Cassidy. I am a doctor. You are going to see my questions kind of reflect the technical aspect of this. By the way, you are talking about having to leave West Virginia, beautiful state, to move to be closer. You are talking about, Ms. Beale, etcetera, same sort of story. Is telemedicine--are people using telemedicine for this? Because I am thinking that probably the examination is not showing very much. It is an interview, and they are asking you a response. So, is Virginia Medicaid covering telemedicine, or are your insurance plans covering telemedicine? Ms. Vazquez. You know, I can, say that, yes, my health plan is covering telemedicine. However, the specialists--many of the specialists that I and others have seen are out of network and sometimes even out of state, which are not necessarily always covered. Many of the folks who have treated---- Senator Cassidy. Now, are the doctors themselves, herself, himself, require you to show up in person, or will they do a telemedicine interview as at least an intake interview? Ms. Vazquez. It depends. I think for those of us who can get in that first appointment via telemedicine, it is great. But so many are in boutique practices. Senator Cassidy. So--Ms. Beale, your experience? Ms. Beale. For me, telemedicine, telehealth is available with my health insurance. However, when I am seeing a specialist, I want to see them--I need to be in the room with them. I want them to see me, all of me so that they---- Senator Cassidy. Oh, I get that. Believe me, there is a therapeutic aspect to that interview, which as a physician, I am so aware of. Sometimes for follow-up it helps though, particularly since you have mentioned the drive is so fatiguing. Ms. Heim, your experience? Ms. Heim. When we lived in West Virginia, WVU had a telemedicine office for children. What would happen was we would go see the specialist in Morgantown and then for prior visit visits after that, we would go into an office and see a nurse or a PA, and they would essentially wheel the doctor in on a screen and we would still get that visit. That was powerful. However, as a child, they required us to be at the hospital to do colonoscopy and pulmonary--all the testing always had to be done---- Senator Cassidy. Of course. Ms. Heim . at the hospital. So even with that help of the telemedicine, we still had to travel quite a bit. Senator Cassidy. Let me ask you---- Ms. Heim. Children's of course, did not--they have not done the telemedicine because a lot of times the doctors aren't licensed in different states. So, you have to be in the state in order to see the doctor. So sometimes we will drive and just kind of park and then see the doctor on the side of the road, but that is not very convenient. Senator Cassidy. Now, you have been involved in Children's. And as y'all were talking, I was on PubMed listening, looking at some of the articles and stuff. And the therapies, are they actually giving you your child therapy at Children's. Put it this way, is she in clinical trials testing different therapies as to what might be benefiting her? Ms. Heim. There is two separate things. There is the long COVID clinic which has the doctors and the specialists, and then there is the NIH study that is run through Children's. So, the study is just gathering information. Senator Cassidy. It is observational. It is not therapy. Ms. Heim. Two of my children are in that study because as a parent, that was the only thing we could do to help the situation is to give them information. So, we just do the study to help. We don't really we get information sometimes, but mostly it is just them doing testing and questionnaires and stuff. The actual clinic has offered advice and treatments, and some of them have helped, yes. Senator Cassidy. Okay. Now, the treatments, some of them are like massage. You had mentioned how massage therapy, etcetera. Are any of them clinical trials? We are going to try this drug versus placebo to see if this drug is beneficial. Ms. Heim. I don't know if it is trials necessarily. But again, they have learned that there is COVID in the stool, right. So, one of my daughter's symptoms was she was nausea and vomiting and constipation and pain every day for like 6 months. She walked around with a puke bag in her hand all the time. When we found out that it might be in the stool, we did a clean out through a colonoscopy that was kind of by chance, but nevertheless, and then we started on a pro and prebiotic that Children's recommended. And those symptoms almost completely went away. Senator Cassidy. Really? Ms. Heim. Yes. Senator Cassidy. That is great. And that was not part of a clinical trial, that was just kind of like---- Ms. Heim. No, but that is what I am saying, I want the doctors to know what we are learning, because somebody could be having nausea and vomiting and pain, and all they got to do is clean out their gut because COVID is still there a year later. Senator Cassidy. Well, the probiotics helped. I mean, obviously---- Ms. Heim. Yes. Senator Cassidy. It has--it is more than cleaning out the gut. But anyway, that said, Ms. Vazquez, post exertional issues are a major--I think everybody is describing you get tired, and you were the runner, so you are going to notice it most. Has there been--and I have read that there are some problems with the mitochondrial so this may not be reparable, but in other cases they are talking about how gradual, physical therapy, etcetera can actually be a positive thing. What therapies have been attempted for you as a former runner to attempt to recover your ability to exert? Ms. Vazquez. As a former runner, I know what it is like to push through and overtrain to the point of stress fractures. And exercise is not good for me, especially when I---- Senator Cassidy. But there is things--there is passive resistance, for example, where the physical therapist kind of moves you back and forth, etcetera. I am not prescribing that. I am just wondering, what is being tried? Ms. Vazquez. You know, I will say that there is just so much evidence that post exertional malaise is the downstream effect of exercise. I think exercise and movement will improve when we manage the upstream drivers of post exertional malaise. Senator Cassidy. Okay.  Senator Cassidy. Okay. Mr. Chairman, I yield. Thank you all. The Chair. Senator Kaine. Senator Kaine. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I really appreciate the witnesses being here. You know, it is--I think it is an honor to testify before the U.S. Senate. It can also be a hassle, but for y'all, it is an additional burden. It is a burden to come. As Ms. Beale testified, or as Ms. Vazquez, traveling across the United States, or Ms. Heim here with family you are going to suffer a consequence from having been here today, likely fatigue. We don't have a lot of witnesses who have to come over the mountain the way you have had to, to be here, and I really appreciate it. I have--you know, I have been dealing with my own long COVID issue for almost 4 years. It is mild, thank goodness. I feel like every nerve ending in my body is in an Alka- Seltzer 24/7, and it is--I can work, I can focus, I can exercise. It is harder to sleep. After 6 months and it not going away, I finally decided, I guess maybe it is not going to. I should see a neurologist. I have been able to be told this is probably not going to get worse, and it is probably not going to get better, and both have proven true. Two other colleagues, one a former colleague, Senator Inhofe, and a current colleague, Senator Young, we wrote a piece about our own experiences together that I would like to introduce into the record, if I might, Mr. Chair. The Chair. Without objection.  Senator Kaine. The reason that we wrote it is, Ms. Vazquez, you pointed out, and I think subsequent testimony is underlying, long COVID is disproportionately affecting people of color. Long COVID is disproportionately affecting women. But we are three white guys. One got long COVID in his 40's, Senator Young. One got long COVID in his 60's, Senator Kaine. One got long COVID in his 80's, Senator Inhofe. We decided after kind of finding ourselves on the floor of the Senate bumming around and wonder if anyone else is having this weird experience here, we found each other and shared our experiences, and I think the reason that we all started to be public about it is, we didn't like that you weren't being believed. U.S. Senators get believed. You know, I----  Senator Kaine. By a certain percentage of the population. I didn't have trouble getting believed by a doctor. I didn't have trouble getting believed by a doctor. I don't think Senator Inhofe did. I don't think Senator Young did. Our physical reports of our own conditions were given credibility, but so often, with women that is not the case. With minorities, that is not the case. With young people, it is not the case. We have seen the similar phenomenon in maternal mortality when we have had hearings about this. We decided the three of us to talk about our experiences so that people would understand they're being believed. And, Mr. Chair, by doing this hearing today, we can approach some substantive improvements. But also, I think doing a hearing like this has a way of sending a message that people are believed. Ms. Beale, I don't want you to say more than you comfortably feel like you can, but can you talk a little bit about this SSDI ordeal and that you have been--I mean, the ADA says long-COVID is a condition, a disabling condition that can be one that would either require reasonable accommodations or lead to an SSDI disability determination. But in a situation where you are already low energy, you are going through an extended process where you have already been denied twice. Talk a little bit about how frustrating that might be. And you are a human resources professional who have helped employees do this, so imagine if you hadn't had that background, how frustrating this would be. Ms. Beale. Thank you for your question, Senator. It has been an ordeal, like you said. It is--the whole process has been very frustrating. The system is very difficult to navigate. You know, when I am working on the paperwork, it is very overwhelming, and I can only work on it but for so long. I have to--you know, I set like a little timer for about 30 minutes, because if I go over that I start getting headaches. I am trying to compile all of my medical documentation to send in. And you know, both times I was denied, SSDI doesn't give specific reasons why you were denied. I don't know what it is that they need for me to show that I can't work. Senator Kaine. Interesting. So, you don't know whether it is, we don't think you are disabled, or you didn't fill out this piece of information right, or you left something blank, or--you really don't know. Ms. Beale. Right. You know, I don't know if they were able to get in contact with all the doctors. I don't--you know, I don't know unless the doctor tells me. Senator Kaine. Here is a class of folks with long COVID who really have problems with the SSDI. A lot of people got COVID before we had tests. You remember how hard it was to get tested early on? And people who are getting COVID at the front end, they weren't even getting tested for COVID because there weren't tests. Then later, okay, maybe they get a vaccine. And then later a test will show that they have antibodies in their body, but that could be because of the vaccine, or it could be because they have already had COVID, and the medical professionals who are trying to make a resolution about SSDI are like, well, you have antibodies, but that doesn't mean you had COVID. There is a set of problems that make this within the SSDI framework really tough. Now, we have dealt with situations like that in other contexts where we have had presumptive determinations for availability of health care benefits when firefighters get certain diseases that are because of conditions that are likely to occur in their profession. We give them presumptions that can be rebutted if they are not true. But it is a difficult proof burden, especially on somebody who is really suffering continuous symptoms of the kind you describe. I hope--I am at my time and over it. I want to let my colleagues go, but I hope that might be something we could focus some attention on. The Chair. Good point. Senator Murkowski. Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for coming here this morning, for sharing your stories speaking about the different journeys that each of you have had or your families have had as you have dealt with long COVID. I want to follow on to what Senator Kaine has been talking about, which is being believed. And you have gone through an experience that has impacted you clearly, physically. You have shared that. But we are living in a time, in a place when everybody questions the reality of the facts on the grounds, whether it is politics, or COVID or, just so many different things. And that is hard. That is hard on the mental health as well. I would ask each of you if you can speak to the challenges that you may have had with regards to access to mental health care, behavioral health, because I have to assume that as you have been dealing with the physical effects of this, when you feel like you are being challenged by others--it is not real. You will get over it. You are making it more than it really is. That has to be very stressful. That has to lead to higher anxiety. That can lead to depression. So, if I can ask the three of you to share any thoughts that you may have on mental health and behavioral health access. We will begin with you, Ms. Vazquez. Ms. Vazquez. Yes. Thank you. A large part of my out-of- pocket expenses have been for therapy, for mental health care. I was not even in Los Angeles. I was not able to find a mental health provider who was in that work who would see me regularly and who didn't require me to drive an hour in traffic. It was--so that's a big part of my expenses. I will say, also, I have a history of PTSD and trauma before getting sick. And honestly, I think having depression in my health record contributed to the medical gaslighting that I experienced. I got a lot of, well the mind has really important impacts on the body. Well, the body has a lot of impact on the mind. I think there is a social, emotional piece to my depression and my mood symptoms. Quite honestly, this is a neuroimmune condition. And brain inflammation has been shown to be linked to many mental illnesses and mood disorders. And so, I 100 percent believe that as I get better care for my long COVID and ME/CFS, my mood will improve because my brain won't be as inflamed. Senator Murkowski. Ms. Beale. Ms. Beale. Thank you. For me, for that access part of your question, the challenge for me has been getting an appointment with a neurologist. I had a neuro-psychological evaluation done, and it took me 9 months just to get that appointment. And in that appointment you go through the different mental health diagnosis and having depression that I didn't have before I was sick and trying to figure out what caused the depression. Well, in my case, it is the long COVID, you know. It has had that effect on me. I have insomnia, anxiety. All of that started when I got COVID and then long COVID. So, that has been challenging. Like what you said, what the doctors are saying to you, is the same for me. You know, you need to walk more. You need to be in the sun. You need vitamin D, all of those things. You know, that will make you feel better mentally. And that might help, yes, but the long COVID is causing the anxiety and depression. If I am not treating the long COVID as it needs to be treated, then the depression and anxiety are going to continue. Senator Murkowski. Thank you. Ms. Heim, do you have anything to add? Ms. Heim. I think one of the things that has been hard for me with my daughter is that she kind of tells herself, well, I just need to work harder. I just need to study more. I just need to do this or this or that, and things are going to get better. And the fact is, that is not true. One of the doctors we work with works with athletes, and they are studying it. And the more we push, the worse it gets. And that is kind of very counterintuitive. But with this thing, we have to figure out a way to treat it without pushing, because what happens is you push harder, it gets worse, then you feel worse, and it is like this rapid cycle that just goes. They have to find a way. When she was doing physical therapy, they did go very slow on the recommendation of that pulmonologist that had the information. So again, it is about them getting the information so we can treat it properly and not create this cycle of depression and anxiety and push and then get worse, and you know. Senator Murkowski. Thank you, thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chair. Okay. Thank you, Senator Smith. Senator Smith . why don't you go to Senator Hickenlooper. The Chair. Okay. Senator Hickenlooper. Well, I don't think Senator Smith would ever defer to me in that--in anything other than allowing me to speak first because I have to go to a press conference and then get back here. But I want to echo the appreciation for all of you to show up today and show up every day. I have one of--as everyone I think here probably in this room has known somebody who has been going through this. I have an old friend who is an amazing person. She was the first female producer of Monday night football, which is a strange claim to fame. And for her to be debilitated, it is just--I can't get my mind around it. I know that you are all going through that same psychological evolution with yourselves, but--with your child. Anyway, thank you. I have got a couple questions here. Ms. Vazquez, you mentioned in your testimony that the tribulations you went through, attempting to obtain a diagnosis of long COVID. The doctors mistaking, some disbelieving. All of that, those travails. Given the nature of long COVID and also the addition to the symptoms and the biomarkers from patient and patient, I think you have spoken, but all of you really referred to the importance of doing more research--of integrating these stories into research. The University of Colorado is one of the nine centers that actually got funding from the Department of Health and Human Services to do some of this research. And so, Ms. Vazquez I was going to ask, what is your sense of what that research should be focusing on? What should be the priorities? Ms. Vazquez. Well, I think, patients again via lived experience and diving into the existing research, really needs to build on the existing research. Long COVID is not a new thing. ME/CFS is not new. Dysautonomia is not new. Mass cell activation is not new. There--and those conditions have historically been very underfunded compared to the disability that they have contributed to over generations. For me, I think the prioritization is grounding the current long-COVID research in the historical, infection associated disease research. Senator Hickenlooper. Ms. Beale. Ms. Beale. Excuse me. I think the research is extremely important because long COVID is a new illness, and there is so much that needs to happen quickly so that there can be a protocol developed and better treatment for us. You know, I pray all the time for a cure, but I don't know if that will happen for us. But at the very least there are some medicines that do help some patients, and there is some different therapies that help patients. But if I had a list of what is going to work, try this, then I would go down and try every single one. But I don't know what that list is. You know, some people try different things, and I don't want to just try different things and make my problems worse. But I don't--you know, we need to know what we can do so that we can feel better. Senator Hickenlooper. Right. Ms. Heim. Ms. Heim. As I was saying before, share the information we already have. Get it out there. I mean, we have--the stuff that we have tried is not expensive, but it has helped, CoQ10 for the brain fog, probiotics, prebiotics. I mean, there is stuff that you can--everybody can try, they just don't know to try it. like she was saying, it gives us hope to at least have an idea or something we can start-- somewhere we can start. Because if it works, it works, and we get our lives back or at least they get better. Senator Hickenlooper. Right. Absolutely. But there is also an inclination in science, and certainly in health care, to not present things until you understand, have all the facts and know what exactly you can recommend and not. I think we are--what we are seeing is the necessity of dealing with more uncertainty, being able to navigate with that. Ms. Vazquez, you also talked about the difficulty of going on and off health care. You all kind of alluded to the challenges of the red tape and the bureaucracy, but there is a strong demand from the public now to prevent fraud, make sure that we are being vigilant with every tax dollar that is spent. What things do you think that we could simplify, and maybe this is a longer question that you can answer later, but how can we make this paperwork simpler and yet make sure that we are still protecting being careful in terms of protecting against fraud? Ms. Vazquez. Yes, I will say that the threat and fear of fraud is probably much smaller in reality. Nobody wants to be sick. Nobody wants to be disabled in an ableist society. I would say things we could do is I think presumptive eligibility would be a huge start for benefits--and both, disability benefits as well as clinical services and community based services. Because there is just such a broad population of folks who are living with this. Senator Hickenlooper. All right. Great. Well thank you. I am out of time, but I appreciate it. Sorry--that is--it is a little bit like jeopardy where you see someone going to the buzzer. Thank you.  The Chair. Thank you, John. Senator Smith. Senator Smith. Thank you, Chair Sanders and Ranking Member Cassidy. And thanks to all of you so much for being here. You know, health is a very personal thing. And so, to be in this room with these bright lights and share such personal stories about your lives is really much appreciated. I really appreciate Senator Murkowski's line of questioning around the kind of the interaction between mental health and physical health, and how one fuels the other and how connected they are. So, just thank you for your answers to that. I would like to just take my time to understand a little bit about how insurance--how it is working with your health insurance coverage. There are no FDA approved treatments for long COVID. I am wondering what your experience has been with your health insurance and their willingness to cover non-approved drugs. I mean, I will be honest, I think a lot of times it is hard for people to get health insurance coverage for stuff that we have a lot more experience with. And so, would each of you just be willing to talk a little bit about what that experience has been. I am wondering if we might be able to learn something from that as we think about what we can do to make this work better. Ms. Vazquez. Yes. Thank you for that question. I feel like--I will send you a longer story that I think really highlights this issue. But I will say generally, on my charts and in billing for my long COVID care, I am diagnosed with a lot of symptoms, and I am able to get prescriptions or treatments for those particular symptoms. That, again, required my specialists to know how to sort of like bill the care that they are providing me. And again, it requires a lot of staff time from their office as well to do prior authorizations, all of that. I do think there is a lot of--a lot that can be done to validate from the insurance side treatments that are for long COVID and not require doctors to sort of do the backend maneuvering to get something covered, when they know it is medically necessary. Senator Smith. This is why I hear from providers all the time that they have to have like a full time staffs that are just trying to figure out how to get insurance companies to cover. Ms. Vazquez. Absolutely, yes. Senator Smith. Right, right. Ms. Beale? Ms. Beale. For me, I think it would be helpful if the insurance companies could recognize long COVID as its own illness, and then maybe some of those treatments and procedures would be covered more quickly. I have experienced delays with different things that I have needed waiting for the insurance to approve it. One example is I need oxygen at night, and my doctor ordered it in August, but I didn't get it until, I think, late October. It was because of my insurance company and the company that was providing the oxygen. I think having to wait for something that you need because of whatever conversation that the insurance company is having with the doctors, all this stuff that is happening behind the scenes that is taking way too long. Senator Smith. Right. Ms. Beale. It needs to be streamlined. Senator Smith. Well, and that is got to have a big impact. You are talking about, for example, suffering from insomnia, struggling to sleep. And there you have right there something that could happen that would be useful. Why do you have to wait? Ms. Beale. Right, exactly. Senator Smith. Ms. Heim, I am really interested in your answer to this question. And I am also wondering, as I understand it, your daughter was able to get connected into a long COVID study at Children's National, and I think often our problems in health care, like you could just sort of multiply them for people that are living in more rural communities. It is like--just always worse, it seems. Could you just maybe talk a bit about your own experience with insurance and then how it has worked with your daughter? How her care has--I wonder been improved because she has been able to be part of this larger hospital study? Ms. Heim. I would say yes, absolutely. I am very fortunate that she got the diagnosis so quickly and got referred into this group. And the study is just separate. It is informational. It is its own entity. But the actual long COVID team that they have--my poor doctor's office, I mean, they had to not only get authorization for the head of the team, but every single doctor on the team. So, it was months of back and forth paperwork. In the meantime, they were trying to do--they thought she had narcolepsy at one point because her fatigue was so bad. And just to get the sleep apnea test, all the crap that they have to go through to just get the test approved, is a nightmare for the doctor's offices. And again, as this is happening, I am watching my child suffer. I am watching her sit down in the middle of a grocery store and just say, I can't go anymore. And then meanwhile, I am waiting, I am waiting, I am waiting, I am waiting to find the answers. So yes, that is very frustrating. Senator Smith. Chair Sanders, I often feel that our insurance companies are designed to figure out how to deny care rather than to provide care, and I think that these stories illustrate what that means for people that are living with long COVID. The Chair. Senator Smith, you are exactly right, and that is why I intend to bring the major insurance companies here. These companies make tens of billions of dollars in profit every single year, and there are very few Americans who don't have to struggle to get the care that they deserve. So that is an issue we will deal with in this Committee.  The Chair. Senator Markey. I will--before Senator Markey, I would remind everybody that we have--this has been an extraordinary panel, but we have four experts who are going to please tell us what kind of progress we are making in understanding the disease and treating it. Senator Markey. Senator Markey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much. Thank you for this hearing. Thank you, Senator Kaine, for your continued leadership and partnership on this issue. COVID is real and it is disabling. And we know that we have to work on it. The numbers are staggering, actually, from NIH, staggering. That of people who have had COVID, 22 percent to 38 percent of them are experiencing long COVID. Can I say that number again? Of people who have had COVID, it is 22 percent to 38 percent who have long COVID. And that may be an underestimation, according to NIH. So even as we talk about 5 percent of adults have had it. Think about the people who have had it and why people who haven't had it should be very careful. They should be masking. They should be getting vaccinated because there is a high probability they will have long COVID. That is what NIH is telling us. So, all the warning signs are there. We thank all of you who are here, for leadership, for your willingness to be here, and I just hope people understand, this is not going away. It is still there. If you get it, there is a very high probability that you are going to have long COVID. So, just something that I think has to be made clear over and over again. In 2018, I introduced a resolution raising awareness of chronic fatigue syndrome. Like long COVID, this illness can come up after fighting off a virus. Now we are seeing more and more people navigating both MECFS and long COVID, and they are fighting for recognition of both condition. People don't believe the patients. They think that there is some phony pretend disease that people have. Well, we know that is not the case. And that is what our witnesses are making very clear here today. Meanwhile, research into these and other infection related chronic illnesses is sorely overdue and underfunded. And this has left patients without answers and health care providers without the training to treat them. It is unacceptable to force people to fight their chronic illnesses and a health system that doesn't recognize their illness. We need to fund research to coordinate and fund research on conditions triggered by viral infections that will drive us toward diagnosis and treatments and cures. Research is medicine's field of dreams from which we harvest the findings which we need to give help to those who are affected. Ms. Vazquez, in your testimony, you shared how your symptoms were dismissed in the early days of the pandemic. And health providers didn't acknowledge the link between viral infections and chronic illnesses. Ms. Vazquez, what would coordinated efforts at the National Institutes of Health to better understand infection associated chronic illnesses mean to you and to all of those who have had similar experiences? Ms. Vazquez. I think if the NIH really embraced the reality of infection associated diseases, we could actually do some incredible science to drive the science forward. I mean, just historically, we didn't believe multiple sclerosis existed. Then we got better imaging and saw all the lesions, and now VA research has shown that Epstein-Barr virus, the virus that causes mono, is very associated to the point of potentially causing multiple sclerosis. If we really embrace sort of the history of infections triggering disease, we can do some really cool science around micro clots or viral persistence. The science is happening on such a small scale, but the U.S. could really be the leader for a cure for these kinds of conditions. Senator Markey. Yes. So, we believe you. Ms. Vazquez. Thank you. Senator Markey. We know you are not faking it. And we know that 22 to 38 percent of those people who have had COVID are not faking it. Otherwise, there wouldn't be so many of them. So, it is absolutely imperative that we provide the funding for research. That we have----  Senator Markey. That we have our top scientists working on this issue, or else we are going to have people with this debilitating illness who have to be out there wondering why they are being stigmatized when there is an underfunding of the research needed in order to provide hope for those families. So, thank you all so much for being here again today. Thank you. The Chair. Okay. This ends our panel with the patients. I know I speak for every Member of this Committee in thanking you. It has not been easy for you literally physically to get here, and your testimony has been extremely powerful and helpful in allowing us to go forward. So, we are very grateful to you being here. Thank you very much.  The Chair. Now we are going to--now we are going to hear from our next panel. We just heard an extraordinary panel of patients, and now we are going to hear a panel of experts, doctors and experts who are studying the issue and trying to help us come up with some solutions to this crisis. We have four very well qualified panelists, Dr. Michelle Harkins, Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, Dr. Charisse Madlock-Brown, and Dr. Tiffany Walker. And we thank all of them very much for being with us. Our first witness is Dr. Harkins. She is a Professor of Medicine and Division Chief of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine at the University of New Mexico. Dr. Harkins, thanks very much for being with us. STATEMENT OF MICHELLE HARKINS, M.D., PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO, ALBUQUERQUE, NM Dr. Harkins. Thank you. Good morning. Thank you, Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and the distinguished Members of this Committee. My name is Michelle Harkins, and I am a pulmonary critical care physician from the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. I am honored to appear before you here today to talk about the impact long COVID is having on patients and to provide recommendations to this Committee based on my work as a clinical researcher, a clinician, and an educator. I am an ICU doc in a busy urban medical center and was in the trenches with the critically ill COVID-19 patients that were dying since the beginning of the pandemic. I was our lead investigator for many COVID clinical trials, including the NIH funded platform networks. As the initial phases of the pandemic changed and we began to learn more about long COVID, and the effects that COVID-19 was having on patients, UNM joined the NIH Recover Initiative to help understand this new disease, and we will participate in Recover clinical trials. I want to share a story about a mid- career primary care doc in rural New Mexico. After serving her community and treating patients for years, she herself became infected with COVID-19, and then months later, she presented with signs of long COVID, including fatigue, brain fog, and difficulty breathing during even short periods of exercise. Two years later, these symptoms so impacted this patient that she eventually decided to leave her work, unable to maintain the mental recall needed to do her job in order to concentrate on her health. The NIH Recovery Research Initiative is poised to systematically study risk factors that lead to long COVID and ultimately lead to treatments that are individualized to certain patients subsets. Thank you for this Committee and all the work that you have done to fund this important initiative, but the research and clinical needs are still ongoing. In addition to research and clinical care, I have a passion for sharing emerging new knowledge with my peers and learning from them about the challenges they face in their own communities of practice. When the pandemic began, I worked closely with Project Echo, leader of the Echo model, an innovative method of creating virtual communities of practice to help accelerate peer to peer knowledge in a trusted community. We set up a virtual Echo network to support the hundreds of health care providers across my state who were struggling to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients in their hospitals and clinics. And when the initial waves of the pandemic slowed, we then set up a parallel program for primary care providers to identify and help treat their long COVID patients, which was a HRSA funded initiative. Through this program, our team has helped train over 800 providers, mostly in New Mexico, but across the entire United States, on how to best identify patients and support them with long COVID. I believe the Federal Government, and this Committee in particular, can help support patients with long COVID in several ways. No. 1, need for continued investment in ongoing research. We need to continue the funding for the research of long COVID, and understanding this very complex disease and its underlying mechanisms will translate into treatments for patients. Clinical trials should reflect the demographics of our population, so improving access for rural participants and those disproportionately affected by the disease is key. No. 2, making access to clinical care easier for patients. We need multidisciplinary clinics with teams of subspecialists and health care providers together to address the myriad of symptoms complexes that these patients face. To make this vision possible, we need to address reimbursement for providers in a multidisciplinary long COVID clinic who are seeing the same patient, multiple providers, for the same illness on the same day. Asking CMS to provide guidance on the billing codes, reimbursements for long COVID, and how this code can best be used in multidisciplinary care is needed. Three, we have to prevent the recurrence or occurrence of long COVID. Vaccines do reduce the risk of long COVID, and so reducing new acquisition and administration costs to give vaccines in rural clinics and other institutions would improve access to care. And supporting clinicians across the country to have access to the most up to date information in trusted communities of practice. Creating a national network of regional communities of practice that meets virtually and can then disseminate and share information involving new research findings and new treatment options to patients is key. This is a tele-mentoring for providers, but in theory, this model could be used to create regional long COVID clinics where the experts actually see the patients directly. Expanded investment in the development of a national network of tele- mentoring would be a huge difference. This national network of local providers and regional and national experts, once created, would then be available to help respond to the next pandemic or health emergency when it arises. Thank you again for the opportunity to testify, and I am happy to answer your questions.  prepared statement of michelle harkins Good Morning Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy and distinguished Members of the Committee, my name is Michelle Harkins and I am a pulmonary and critical physician from the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, NM. I am honored to appear before you today to talk about the impact Long COVID is having on patients and provide some recommendations based on my work as a clinical researcher, a clinician, and an educator on how I believe this Committee and the Federal Government can make a huge difference on the day to day lives of Americans suffering with Long COVID. My background As an ICU doctor at a busy urban medical center, I was in the trenches with critically ill patients dying of COVID-19. I very quickly became part of exciting networks of researchers--public, private, and everything in between--who came together with the singular goal of understanding this new disease. I was our lead investigator for many COVID clinical studies at University of New Mexico, .first to study therapeutics for the acute disease and then the long-term effects of COVID-19. I will share a story of a woman in the middle of career as a primary care provider in rural New Mexico. After serving her community and treating patients for years, she herself became infected with COVID-19 and then months later presented with signs of Long COVID including brain fog, and difficulty breathing during even short periods of exercise. She came to see me for these persistent symptoms. All of her diagnostic tests were essentially normal. Two years later, she still is active and goes on walks but has to stop several times to catch her breath. These symptoms so impacted this patient, that she eventually decided to leave her work, unable to maintain the mental recall needed to do her job. I was fortunate to participate in the NIH Adaptive COVID Treatment Trials (ACTT) and Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Intervention and Vaccines (ACTIV) trial networks that provided randomized control trial evidence of medications that worked and those that did not in acute COVID. I am currently a Co-Investigator for the adult cohort of the NIH Recover study and we are now enrolling for the RECOVER VITAL study, a treatment trial with Paxlovid for Long COVID, and hope to participate in the other sub studies. The NIH Recover Research Program is poised to systematically study risk factors and clinical symptoms that lead to Long COVID and ultimately to treatments that are individualized to certain clinical subsets of patients. This network has relied on extreme collaboration between scientists, clinicians, patients and advocates to inform the study design and processes that has never before been seen. Thank you for all this Committee has done to fund this important initiative as the research and clinical needs are still ongoing. In addition to research and seeing patients, I also have a passion for sharing emerging new knowledge with my peers and learning from them about the challenges they face in their environment. When the pandemic began, I worked closely with Project ECHO, leader of the ECHO model, an innovative method of creating virtual communities of practice to help accelerate peer-to-peer knowledge in a trusted community. We set up a virtual ECHO network to support the hundreds of health care providers across the state who were struggling to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients in their hospitals and clinics. When the initial waves of the pandemic slowed, we then set up a parallel program for primary care providers struggling to identify and treat Long COVID patients which was funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Telehealth Technology-Enabled Learning Program (TTELP) initiative. Through this program my team and I have helped train over 800 local providers across the United States on how best to identify and support patients with Long COVID. The problem The CDC previously estimated that 1 in 5 adults and 1 in 4 children will experience some form of Long COVID. There are over 1.1 million deaths due to COVID and now CDC data mark more than 5000 deaths from Long COVID. These Long COVID death rates varied by race and ethnicity, from a high of 14.1 cases per million among American Indian/Alaska Naves, 6.7 cases per million for White, 6.4 cases per million for Black and 4.7 cases per million for Hispanic to a low of 1.5 cases per million among Asian. These numbers are likely underestimated for a variety of reasons; increased mortality from COVID-19 in some racial and ethnic groups resulting in lower numbers to develop of Long COVID, lack of access to health care or to providers that could diagnose them, or patient deaths were attributed to other causes. Symptoms of long COVID can be wide ranging and difficult to diagnose. For a primary care practitioner in a small community for example who doesn't see many cases, it may be difficult for that provider to differentiate long COVID from symptoms of existing illnesses a patient may have or would develop. We are learning every day about the potentially debilitating and life altering effects of this disease. Recommendaons Based on my experience as a clinician, researcher, and educator, I suggest a few ways in which I believe the Federal Government and this Committee in particular can help support patients with Long COVID and the providers and care teams working to help these patients. A. The need for continued investment in ongoing research We need to continue funding research in Long COVID. We are learning more each day about this complex disease and its mechanisms which will translate into treatment plans for patients to improve their quality of life and their ability to manage their disease more effectively To be most effective, we need to ensure that a research network is able to share data on all levels (public health, community, Federal and state) among researchers, that transparency of the results of research is valued. We also need to improve access for all subjects to participate in research studies on Long COVID no matter where they live or what other social determinants of health impact them. We must be sure subjects enrolled reflect all of our population and especially those that are disproportionately affected by the disease. These efforts will help us beer understand the parameters of this disease and the range of ways it is affecting our diverse populations. Long COVID syndromes and symptoms are varied, and multiple cell types and organ systems are involved and so answers to therapy are complex and will take me. B. Making Access to Clinical Care Easier for Patients Very few Long COVID clinics exist nationwide. If they do exist, they are in bigger academic centers in big cities. In New Mexico for example, we have one Long COVID clinic at UNM run by my Project Echo co-medical director Dr. Alisha Parada, a general internist. What we need are multidisciplinary clinics to address the myriad of symptom complexes that these patients face. For example, we need a pulmonologist, a cardiologist, a neurologist or psychologist, physical therapy, occupational and speech therapy and social workers to be in one location so that the patients can be seen by whomever they need. Long COVID patients tend to be sicker and use the health care system more regularly. Multidisciplinary clinics can ultimately help reduce these costs on the healthcare system. To make this vision possible, we need to figure out how to reimburse providers in a multidisciplinary Long COVID clinic for seeing patients with the same diagnosis on the same day. A Long COVID patient might come to a multidisciplinary clinic and need to see a neurologist, a cardiologist, and an internist, all for the same diagnosis of Long COVID. This Committee should ask CMS to look into ways that it could provide guidance on the billing codes, reimbursements for Long COVID, and how this code can be best used for the multidisciplinary care many Long COVID patients need. This Committee should also encourage insurers and CMS to support evaluations for Long COVID. Evaluations for Long COVID are complicated and can involve a broad group of signs and symptoms. There is no one blood test for diagnosis. Without insurance coverage and access to these clinics, many patients will not get the evaluation and assessment tools they need. C. Helping to prevent the occurrence of Long COVID in the future There is yet another surge in acute COVID-19 infections across the country. With the end of the public health emergency for COVID-19, it is harder for patients, especially in rural settings or from marginalized communities, to get access to vaccines. Reducing cost barriers will improve the ability to deliver vaccines in rural clinics, institutions and in all populations. In many areas, the cost for medical centers to give the vaccine is more than their reimbursement rate for the visit, making it difficult for many clinics to provide them. D. Supporting clinicians across the country to have access to the most up-to-date best practices in trusted communities of practice We can do a much better job with educating the public and providers regarding COVID and Long COVID. As an example, the ECHO model has been shown to be a cost-effective, and efficient way to support local providers to learn new information as a disease is changing and evolving. When the pandemic hit, Project ECHO, funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), created a national network of state and regional virtual communities of practice designed to support nursing homes to train their state. on infection control and prevention just as nursing home state. and residents were being hit hard by the disease. This initiative proved the ability to create a nation-wide network of regional communities of practice, all sharing evolving best practices and taking in new information each week and each month about what clinicians were seeing in their own community as they see patients. Creating a national network of regional communities of practice that meet virtually would also help to share and disseminate evolving research findings and new treatment options. Once the pandemic is truly over, we need the necessary skills and network to be ready for the next pandemic or health emergency that arises. The HRSA TTELP Initiative provides an early example. Expanded investment in the development of a national network for telementoring would make a huge difference This national network of local providers and regional and national experts, once created, would then be available to help respond to the next pandemic or health emergency as it arises. This is telementoring for providers but in theory this model could be created as regional Long COVID Clinics where the experts actually consult with the patients. Thank you again for the opportunity to testify on Long COVID. It is real. It affects many Americans and we need continued funding for research in hopes to find treatments for patients, and to educate providers. The patient I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks has stepped away from her career as a primary care physician serving her community in rural New Mexico. Your investments today can help increase the chances that we will find treatments for Long COVID and ensure that these patients such as mine don't lose years of their life to this disease, but instead can be as active and productive members of society as possible. I am happy to answer any questions you may have.

I was our lead investigator for many COVID clinical studies at University of New Mexico first to study the disease and then the long-term effects of COVID-19. Based on my experience as a clinician, researcher, and educator, my recommendation points are: The need for continued investment in ongoing research We need to continue funding research in Long COVID and have more representation from rural and underserved or affected communities in trials. We are learning more each day about this complex disease and its mechanisms which will translate into treatment plans for patients to improve their quality of life and their ability to manage their disease more effectively Making Access to Clinical Care Easier for Patients What we need are multidisciplinary clinics to address the myriad of symptom complexes that these patients face. This Committee should ask CMS to look into ways that it could provide guidance on the billing code, reimbursements for Long COVID, and how this code can be best used for the muldisciplinary care many Long COVID patients need. This Committee should also encourage insurers and CMS to support evaluations for Long COVID. Helping to prevent the occurrence of Long COVID in the future With the end of the public health emergency for COVID-19, it is harder for patients, especially in rural settings or institutions or disenfranchised communities, to get access to vaccines. Reducing cost barriers will improve ability to deliver vaccines in rural clinics and institutions. Supporting clinicians across the country to have access to the most up-to-date best practices and trusted communities of practice via Project ECHO Creating a national network of regional communities of practice that meet virtually would also help to share and disseminate evolving research findings and new treatment options.

This national network of local providers and regional and national experts, once created, would then be available to help respond to the next pandemic or health emergency as it arises. All of these efforts could be done in parallel as we can't do one without the other. ______ The Chair. Thank you, Dr. Harkins. Our next witness will be Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Washington University School of Medicine. Dr. Al-Aly, thanks for being with us. STATEMENT OF ZIYAD AL-ALY, M.D., CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGIST, WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY IN ST. LOUIS, ST. LOUIS, MO Dr. Al-Aly. Chairman Sanders and Ranking Member, Dr. Cassidy, and Members of the HELP Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I am a physician scientist at Washington University in Saint Louis. My team and I produced the first systematic characterization of long COVID, and so far, the most widely cited research on long COVID. We have been at the forefront of long COVID research since the early days of the pandemic, when patients started telling us that they are not fully recovering from COVID-19. Now, long COVID represents the constellation of long term health effects of COVID-19. It is a multi-system disorder that can affect nearly every organ system. It affects the brain. It affects the heart. It affects the endocrine system. It affects the immune system. It affects the GI system. Long COVID affects at least 20 million Americans. It affects people across the lifespan. We have kids with long COVID. We will have people who are 100 years old with long COVID. It affects people across the lifespan and across demographic groups. The burden of long COVID, the burden of disease and disability from long COVID, when you measure it, is on par with the burden of cancer and heart disease. And even if people emerge unscathed after having the first infection, they can still get long COVID after reinfection. And I don't think enough people really know this fact or know about this. Recovery rates of long COVID are also low. Between low rates of recovery from long COVID and the cases are due to reinfection, we are poised to see continued rise in the burden of long COVID until we find better ways to prevent it and treat it. Now, you should be asking me now how do we prevent long COVID? Well, the best way to prevent long COVID is to prevent COVID in the first place. There is actually no long COVID without COVID. You know, if you go back to 2019, you go back to 2018, none of us have heard of long COVID. Have you? You haven't. It didn't exist. There is no long COVID without COVID. We need a sustainable, multi-pronged approach to prevent repeated infections that would be embraced by the public. This requires accelerating the development of oral intranasal vaccines that block infections. This is very, very, very important. Ventilation and air filtration systems are also very important. They can play a major role in reducing the risk of transmission of airborne pathogens. We also need variant proof vaccines. What the virus is doing is really continuing to mutate on us. You know, every few months you are going to see a new variant. We need a variant proof vaccine that lasts for a long time. That is durable. That has durable--and offers durable immunity. People are sick and tired of having to have boosters every few months. We need vaccines that last for 5 years or so they can get it done and get it over with for 5 years. We must also understand vaccine side effects. This must be acknowledged and understood very, very deeply. This is very, very important. Now you should be asking me also like how do we treat Long-COVID? You have heard it before. There are zero, zero approved medication for the treatment of long COVID. So, these people have nothing to really lean on for curative treatment. Nothing, zero. Zero FDA approved medications for the treatment of long COVID. This must change. We really need to change this. It is not beyond the might and the prowess of American medicine to solve this problem. It is absolutely not. We solved much, much harder problems in the past. We just need to focus on this and solve it. We are the best nation on earth, and we can solve this. It is absolutely not beyond our prowess to address this. Now, people suffering from long COVID need treatment yesterday. You know, the ongoing and planned trials for long COVID are too slow and too small to offer definitive treatments. We have developed vaccines at record speed, at warp speed. You know, what we are doing with long COVID, we are doing trial for long COVID at snail speed. This is what we are doing. We urgently, urgently need trials, large scale try to test a broad array of repurposed drugs and development of new drugs to treat long COVID. We must also identify and address the barriers that are preventing the pharmaceutical industry from entering the trials of long COVID--from doing trials on long COVID. You could be asking me now, like, is COVID unique in its ability to produce chronic illness and long COVID? And the answer is really no. People reported debilitating fatigue, cognitive decline, and Parkinson's disease after the Spanish flu, but we just swept under the rug. You know, other viruses, including polio and Epstein-Barr virus, can also produce chronic diseases. EBV can cause multiple sclerosis. Chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS, is also linked to a viral illness, a flu like illness. It is a debilitating disease that affects 4.3 million people in the U.S. These patients have been marginalized and ignored for decades. So, what do we learn from all of this? Well, we learn from all of this acute infections--what I learned, the lesson No. 1 from this whole pandemic, that acute infections can lead to chronic disease. That pandemics disable people. This is not new. It happened after the Spanish flu, but we just ignored it. We just swept under the rug. We call all of this broadly infection associated chronic illnesses. This include long COVID and includes ME/CFS and other--and other basket of conditions that are MMA from acute infections. Had we connected the dots between acute infections and chronic diseases before the pandemic, we would have been in a much, much better place to actually address the challenge of long COVID. We failed to connect those dots before the pandemic. Let's not do that same mistake again, and be poised and ready to really address the challenge of long COVID and also the next pandemic. Where do we go from here? The research effort of long COVID must match the urgency and the scale of the problem. This is my opinion, because really it must. And this going to require a coordinated approach. In my opinion, the U.S. should consider the establishment within NIH of an institute to address infection associated chronic illnesses. That includes long COVID, ME/CFS have been ignored for a long time, and other infection associated chronic illnesses. You have an historic opportunity to act. The lives of millions of people here and around the globe, now and in the future, depend on this.

This must change. People suffering from Long Covid need treatment yesterday. The ongoing and planned trials for Long Covid are too slow and too small (i.e. underpowered) to provide definitive answers. We developed vaccines at warp speed. We are doing trials for Long Covid at snail speed. We urgently need large scale trials to test a broad array of repurposed drugs and development of novels drugs to treat Long Covid. This must be an all-hands-on-deck situation. This is not solely a U.S. Government problem. We must identify and address the barriers that are preventing the private sector (pharmaceutical industry) from investing in trials for Long Covid (for example, build consensus around clinical trial endpoints that are acceptable to regulators). Is COVID-19 unique in causing chronic illness (Long Covid)? No. SARS-CoV-2 is novel (was novel in 2019/2020) and the scale of the pandemic is certainly large. But the idea that a virus that produces acute infections can also cause chronic disease is not new. We just ignored it for 100 years. Historical accounts of both the 1889-1892 (Russian flu) and 1918 Spanish flu pandemic show that many people suffered from long-term health effects including cognitive decline, debilitating fatigue and Parkinson's disease in the convalescent phase of the infection41-46.

Had we connected these dots (between acute infections and chronic disease) before the COVID-19 pandemic, we would have been in a much better place to address the challenge of Long Covid. What do we learn from this? If we learn one thing from this pandemic, we must recognize that ``pandemics disable people''--that is acute infections can lead to chronic disabling disease. We call these Infection-Associated Chronic Conditions (IACC). These include Long Covid, ME/CFS and many other acute infections that lead to chronic disease. Urgent and commensurate (proportional) response is needed We don't go through an earthquake without dealing with its aftermath. We cannot live through the biggest pandemic of our lives without dealing with the aftermath. That aftermath is Long Covid. We must address the challenge of Long Covid. The current research effort on Long Covid does not match the scale and the urgency of the problem. Research effort must be commensurate with the burden of disease caused by these infections. And it should be executed with a sense of urgency. The U.S. should consider the establishment within the National Institutes of Health of an Institute for Infection-Associated Chronic Illnesses with a budget of at least $1 billion per year to address the complexity and multisystemic nature of Long Covid, ME/CFS and other IACC. Because pandemics will continue to happen (and their frequency will likely be higher in the 21st century than in the 20th century), and because pandemics will likely produce in their wake droves of people with chronic disease and disability, understanding how infections cause chronic illnesses should also be a cornerstone of pandemic preparedness and resilience. An NIH institute for the study of Infection-Associated Chronic Conditions will help us address the needs of Long Covid, other IACC and position us to be more optimally prepared for the next pandemic. I urge the U.S. Congress and the executive branch to work together to materialize this. You have an historic opportunity to act. The lives of millions of Americans now and in the future depend on this. Disclaimer: My employers had no role in developing this testimony.

I am a physician-scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. My team and I produced the first systematic characterization of Long COVID and the most widely cited research on Long COVID. We have been at the forefront of Long COVID research since the early days of the pandemic when patients started telling us that they are not fully recovering from COVID-19. Long COVID is a multisystem disorder that affects nearly every organ system including the heart, the brain, the endocrine system and the gastrointestinal system. Long COVID affects at least 20 million Americans. It affects people across the lifespan--from children to older adults. It affects people across race, ethnicity and sex. The burden of disease and disability in Long COVID is on par with heart disease and cancer. People can get Long COVID after reinfection. Research from the U.S. and Canada is clear. Even if people managed to emerge unscathed after the first infection, they may get Long COVID after reinfection. Prevention of Long COVID We need sustainable solutions to prevent repeated infections and Long COVID that would be embraced by the public. This requires acceleration of development of oral or intranasal vaccines, investment in ventilation and air filtration systems for cleaner indoor air, development of variant-proof and durable vaccines and broadening the pipeline of antivirals. Treatment of Long COVID There are zero FDA approved medications for the treatment of Long COVID. The ongoing and planned trials for Long COVID are too slow and too small to provide definitive answers. We urgently need large scale trials to test a broad array of repurposed drugs and development of new drugs to treat Long COVID.

Our third witness--our third witness is Dr. Charisse Madlock-Brown, Associate Professor of Health Informatics at the University of Iowa College of Nursing. Dr. Madlock-Brown, thanks very much for being with us. STATEMENT OF CHARISSE MADLOCK-BROWN, PH.D., ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF HEALTH INFORMATICS, UNIVERSITY OF IOWA, IOWA CITY, IA Dr. Madlock-Brown. Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to participate. Since 2021, I have been the co-lead for the National COVID Cohort Collaboratives, N3C, their social determinant of health domain team. At N3C and through the Recover Program, through their observational research arm, I have worked with a diverse team of clinicians, patient representatives, epidemiologists, and informatics professionals to investigate patterns in EHR data related to long COVID. Large scale chronic health record networks have been essential in advancing our understanding of long COVID, mainly due to their extensive patient health--their extensive patient health information and coverage of diverse patient populations. This diversity is key to studying long COVID's impact across different groups. However, using data from these systems presents challenges like differences in utilization by subgroups and incomplete health records. These issues are partially addressed through privacy preserving linkage between health systems and integrating billing data systems. These network efforts, such N3C, are crucial in overcoming observational data limitations, such as the lack of standardization in these systems. Large networks have been instrumental in implementing harmonization pipelines and promoting data standardization at a national level, thus enhancing the reliability and comparability of research findings on long COVID. Identifying patients with long COVID in electronic health record systems presents a challenge as the condition is severely underdiagnosed. Analysis of the long COVID code that came out in October 2021 in the N3C system revealed demographic disparities in long COVID diagnosis, where patients who were female, white, non-Hispanic, and living in areas with low poverty and low unemployment were more likely to receive a diagnosis, which emphasized the need for greater accessibility to diagnosis and treatment. Researchers have--do have several options to identify patients with long COVID in these systems. For instance, at our--at N3C, one team developed a machine learning model which showed high accuracy in classifying patients without a diagnosis. The model was trained using data from patients who would visit a long COVID clinic. At the same time, other observational studies focus on improving self-reporting of symptoms like brain fog and fatigue. Researchers using these electronic health record data warehouses have been pivotal in helping us understand both COVID-19 and long COVID, revealing key symptoms and risk factors. One review by Sudre has identified common symptoms, while others have really shown the variability in post-COVID conditions across different populations. To further characterize long COVID, one N3C team used computational modeling to classify patients into six distinct clusters, with an emphasis on indicating cluster's severity of condition. Another analyzed data from thousands of patients categorizing symptom co-occurrence into neurological, cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, and co-morbid condition clusters, which can help us understand the trends in long COVID broadly. Infection associated chronic illness is not new. There is a significant intersection in symptomology between long COVID and a spectrum of related chronic conditions, notably myalgic encephalomyelitis, chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS. Studies have shown that 50 percent of long COVID patients fit ME/CFS criteria. The emergence of long COVID has cast a spotlight on these conditions, underscoring the urgent need for more research into their shared characteristics and underlying mechanisms. There is a critical need for a moonshot initiative to tackle long COVID. The scarcity of clinical trials focusing on long COVID's underlying causes and treatments poses a barrier to progress. A call to actions by patients and researchers proposes that the U.S. Government leads this initiative with a significant annual investment, like the Cancer Moonshot Program, to inspire global action against this widespread health challenge. Key priorities for the moonshot initiative should be conducting clinical trials for behavioral and experimental medicine treatments. In tandem with clinical trials, several activities can support observational research systems like N3C to enhance our understanding of long COVID and bolster trial findings. Activities can include symptoms and phenotypes across the swath of infection associated chronic conditions, improving diagnosis and treatment accessibility, and establishing clinical guidelines for consistent diagnosis. Additionally, the moonshot should emphasize coordinated clinical programs for underserved communities, structuring clinical data for better research, including incorporating social determinants of health data to better understand biases in health and disparities in outcomes. Linking these systems with clinical trials and data sets like claims and mortality for more comprehensive representation of patient health. These efforts aim to advance the understanding and treatment of long COVID, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.  prepared statement of charisse madlock-brown My Background Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to participant in this hearing. I am a faculty member in Health Informatics at the University of Iowa College of Nursing. I was previously an associate professor at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. I received my Master's in Library and Information Science and Ph.D. in Health Informatics from the University of Iowa. I have a broad background in health informatics, with a current focus on social determinants of health, COVID-19, health disparities, obesity trends, and multimorbidity. I use machine learning and bio-statistics to analyze large electronic health record (EHR) data warehouses. Since 2021, I have been the co-lead for the National Cohort Collaborative's (N3C) Social Determinant of Health (SDoH) domain team directing research on SDoH and COVID-19 outcomes as well as data engineering efforts to improve harmonization of individual level SDoH data into Data warehouses. Additionally, I am the Iowa site PI for the Center for Linkage and Acquisition of Data (CLAD) for the All of Us program.1 The ``All of Us'' Research Program is a significant initiative aiming to recruit at least one million participants from across the diverse spectrum of the United States. CLAD will further the program's efforts through integrating claims, mortality, and environmental data into existing EHR and survey data. The N3C project, \1\ developed in partnership with the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), focuses on identifying cases of COVID-19 in a network of HER systems, including those that are laboratory-confirmed, suspected, or considered possible. To facilitate accurate comparisons and analyses, these COVID-19 cases are demographically matched with control subjects who have tested negative or equivocal for COVID-19. The matching criteria include age group, sex, race, and ethnicity. The ratio of COVID-19 cases to control subjects is maintained at 1:2, ensuring a robust and representative comparison group for the study. N3C continuously grows its network and currently comprises 83 distinct healthcare sites representing all regions in the U.S. and 21.7 million patients. N3C is part of the EHR arm of the Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) NIH initiative. \2\ As a funded N3C RECOVER researcher, I work with a diverse team of clinicians, patient representatives, epidemiologists, and informatics professionals to investigate patterns in EHR data related to long COVID. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ All of Us Research Program Establishes New Center for Linkage and Acquisition of Data.

These statements are made on my behalf and do not represent N3C or RECOVER. Benefits of leveraging EHR data base systems for long COVID research Large-scale Electronic Health Record (EHR) warehouse networks have played a pivotal role in rapidly developing insights into long COVID due to several key factors. First, EHRs contain a breadth of coded patient health information, including histories of diagnoses, medication prescriptions, lab results, vital measurements and outcomes. \3\ Additionally, EHRs cover large and diverse patient populations across various demographics, geographic locations, and healthcare settings. This diversity is crucial for studying long COVID in different groups, enhancing the generalizability of findings. Another significant advantage of EHRs is the provision of longitudinal data, allowing researchers to track patients' health over extended periods. \4\ This aspect is particularly important for long COVID, characterized by prolonged and evolving symptoms. Inquiries into observational EHR data warehouses can be launched immediately, provided the data is available \5\. In contrast, clinical trials take a great deal of time to launch, enroll, and complete prior to the data becoming available for analysis. This real-world data aids in understanding patterns of clinical management surrounding long COVID. \6\ EHRs also contain critical data on comorbidities, \7\ shedding light on risk factors and the impact of long COVID on individuals with specific health profiles. EHRs also enable the identification of subgroups within long COVID patients, presenting distinct clinical features, which is key for understanding a disease that may have more than one etiology and presentation. \8\ The ability to share EHR data bases across institutions facilitates collaborative research and larger-scale studies, essential for understanding complex conditions like long COVID. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \3\ National Institutes of Health.

The continuous updating of EHRs ensures rapid availability of recent data--crucial for an emerging condition like long COVID where knowledge is rapidly evolving. Regarding pharmacovigilance, EHR data can be instrumental in monitoring adverse drug reactions, \9\ which may be particularly important as new treatments for long COVID emerge. Last, using existing EHR data is often more cost-effective than new data collection, \10\ especially relevant for a widespread condition like long COVID. This cost-effectiveness makes EHRs an invaluable resource in the ongoing research and understanding of long COVID. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \9\ Muzaffar, A.

This type of incompleteness can be partially mitigated through patient privacy preserving linkage between different healthcare systems as well as billing data sources, \12\ such as CMS. Variations in data capture and data mappings between electronic systems also impact data incompleteness. For example, long COVID diagnosis coding varied over time and by site, \13\ as did the mapping of this code to research data warehouses. Implementing data harmonization pipelines and quality assessments within EHR analytic platforms can enhance data interoperability and inform data selection and cleaning prior to analysis. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \11\ Kim, E. et al.

Observational health researchers much also keep in mind that patients who visit large healthcare systems are not representative of the entire population as healthy patients or patients with less access to care will be less present in the sample. \14\ This is partially mitigated by including a diverse range of healthcare sites and linking CMS data from all patient encounters so that researchers can ensure a more representative sample that includes patients with milder illness and fewer healthcare interactions. Patient utilization differences by sub-groups due to varying levels of healthcare access among different demographic groups can be partially overcome by ensuring representation from diverse communities and analyzing utilization patterns to identify and correct for bias. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \14\ National Academies of Sciences, E., Division, H. and M., Services, B. on H.

The lack of standardization in EHR systems, \15\ a significant barrier in aggregating and comparing data across sources, has been tackled by large networks implementing harmonization pipelines, and facilitating data standardization at the national level. A large EHR network can establish data quality benchmarks by showing institutions where they might be lacking certain data richness when compared to other members of the network. This can support investigation and improvement of local data collection and mapping practices. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \15\ Sidky, H. et al. Data quality considerations for evaluating COVID-19 treatments using real world data: learnings from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). BMC Med. Res. Methodol. 23, 46 (2023). By addressing these various challenges through the strategic use of large EHR warehouse networks, research into long COVID and similar complex health conditions (e.g., Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and Postural tachycardia syndrome), can become more accurate, inclusive, and representative, leading to more effective and personalized healthcare solutions. Methods for Identifying long COVID patients Identifying patients with long COVID in Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems presents a significant challenge in current medical research as the condition is underdiagnosed. Machine Learning Models: Pfaff et al. developed a machine learning model to identify probable long COVID patients using a training dataset from 597 patients at long-COVID clinics using N3C. \16\ The XGBoost model was tested in a cohort of 97,995 COVID-19 patients into three categories: all COVID-19 patients, hospitalized, and non-hospitalized patients. Key features for identifying long COVID included healthcare utilization, patient age, dyspnea, and other diagnosis and medication information. The models showed high accuracy in pinpointing potential long-COVID patients. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \16\ Weiskopf, N. G., Hripcsak, G., Swaminathan, S. & Weng, C. Defining and measuring completeness of electronic health records for secondary use. J. Biomed. Inform. 46, 830--836 (2013). Prospective Observational Cohort Study: Researchers conducted a nationwide, prospective observational cohort study, involving adults who completed a symptom survey 6 months after acute COVID-19 symptom onset or testing positive. \17\ The study identified PASC based on 44 self-reported symptoms, emphasizing symptoms like post exertional malaise, fatigue, and brain fog. This method provided a symptom-based definition of PASC. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \17\ Pfaff, E. R. et al. Who has long-COVID?

Analysis of U09.9 ICD-10-CM Code Usage: Researchers used theICD-10- CM code U09.9, ``Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified,'' in the N3C system to identify patients with long COVID. It focused on 33,782 patients with a U09.9 diagnosis, examining demographics, social determinants of health, co-occurring diagnoses, medications, and procedures within 60 days of diagnosis, particularly noting age group differences. The study found that long COVID diagnoses (U09.9) were predominantly among female, White, non-Hispanic individuals from low poverty and unemployment areas, highlighting disparities in long COVID diagnosis and suggesting the need for further research and action. Research using EHR data warehouses to identify symptoms and risk factors associated with long COVID Research utilizing EHR data warehouses has significantly contributed to understanding the symptoms and risk factors of COVID-19 and its prolonged effects, often referred to as Long COVID or post- acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). Sudre CH et al.'s review identified symptoms of long COVID common across multiple studies, including fatigue, exertional dyspnea, musculoskeletal pain, and ``brain fog,'' with additional mental health issues like anxiety, depression, and PTSD. \18\ This study emphasizes the broad range of symptoms that can persist or emerge well after the acute phase of the infection. A comprehensive study across 31 health systems in the United States, part of N3C, involved 8,325 individuals with PASC. \19\ This study examined a range of factors, including demographics, comorbidities, and acute characteristics of COVID-19, to identify risk factors for PASC. Key findings included the higher prevalence of diagnosis of PASC in individuals over 50 years old, females, non- Hispanic Whites, and those with specific comorbidities like depression, chronic lung disease, and obesity. Zang et al used electronic health records from two large networks, INSIGHT and OneFlorida+, covering over 27 million patients in NYC and Florida, to investigate post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC, or long COVID). \20\ Employing a high-throughput screening approach, the study identified a range of diagnoses and medications with higher incidence in patients 30-180 days post-COVID infection compared to non-infected individuals. Notable findings include a greater number of PASC cases in NYC than Florida, with conditions like dementia, hair loss, and pulmonary issues common in both cohorts. The study highlights the variability in long COVID risks across different populations. These studies, leveraging the extensive data available in EHR warehouses, underscore the diverse and complex nature of COVID-19 and its long-term effects. They highlight the critical role of comprehensive data analysis in understanding this evolving health issue, informing potential early intervention strategies, and guiding future clinical and epidemiological research for effective management and treatment of PASC. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \18\ Thaweethai, T. et al.

Specific abnormalities, such as pulmonary, neuropsychiatric, and cardiovascular issues, characterize these clusters. The approach was validated across different hospital systems. Pfaff et al analyzed data from 33,782 patients diagnosed with U09.9 and identified four major categories of diagnoses that commonly co-occur with the U09.9 code.12 These categories include cardiopulmonary, neurological, gastrointestinal, and comorbid conditions. This method provides insights into the prevalent health issues associated with long COVID and how they are documented in healthcare records. It also has evolved into new sub-phenotyping approaches used in N3C RECOVER queries. These papers show that, despite the varied nature of the symptomology of long COVID, it is possible to characterize symptoms in broad categories, which will help future researchers develop patient profiles for long COVID. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \21\ Zang, C. et al.

The emergence of long COVID has cast a spotlight on these conditions, underscoring the urgent need for more research into their shared characteristics and underlying mechanisms. Redox Imbalance in COVID-19 and ME/CFS: This review highlights the similarities between PASC and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), particularly in terms of redox imbalance, systemic and neuroinflammation, impaired ATP generation, and hypometabolism. \22\ These biological abnormalities provide evidence of a shared biological basis between long COVID-19 and ME/CFS, indicating potential pathways for new therapeutic approaches. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \22\ Reese, J.

Long COVID as a Form of infection-associated chronic illness/ME/ CFS: This paper posits that long COVID is essentially the same condition as ME/CFS, also an infection-associated chronic illness. \24\ It argues that acute COVID-19 triggers ME/CFS, similar to other infectious agents. The literature review by Komaroff et al. notes considerable similarities between ME/CFS and Long COVID, particularly in symptomatology and biological abnormalities. \25\ It emphasizes that ME/CFS often follows an infectious-like illness and is characterized by post-exertional malaise, similar to Long COVID. In fact, several studies estimate that half of long COVID patients fit the criteria for ME/CFS. \26\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \24\ Fung, K.

Future directions A moonshot initiative is urgently needed in the wake of the persistent and global challenge of long COVID. \27\ The current landscape of research into this condition is alarmingly disjointed. Experts in diverse medical specialties, including pulmonology, neurology, and cardiology, remain siloed, rarely crossing paths to share insights. The scarcity of clinical trials aimed at the underlying causes of long COVID and the need for a robust infrastructure for swift trial implementation pose a significant barrier to progress. \28\ This situation is further exacerbated by the inadequate long-term funding, causing hesitation among scientists and companies in pursuing potential treatments. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \27\ Grach, S.

This call to action urges the U.S. government to spearhead this moonshot by committing an annual investment of at least $1 billion over the next 10 years. Such a bold move could galvanize global efforts, encouraging governments worldwide to rise to this health challenge that affects every continent. The effectiveness of substantial funding is evident in cancer research as seen through initiatives like the Cancer Moonshot. \29\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \29\ Davis, H.

Primary activities for a long COVID moonshot must be clinical trials so that effective treatments can be tested and developed. There is a particular need for studies on experimental medicines, as currently, there are only 12 such studies for long COVID listed in ClinicalTrials.gov \30\. In tandem with clinical trials, there are several ways observational research systems like N3C can both enhance our understanding of long COVID and bolster findings from trials: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \30\ About the Cancer MoonshotSM--NCI. https://www.cancer.gov/ research/key--initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative/about (2022). 1.

This will enhance our understanding of long COVID and similar conditions, leading to more effective --------------------------------------------------------------------------- treatments and management strategies. 2. Improving Diagnosis and Treatment Accessibility: Addressing biases in long COVID diagnosis, as highlighted by research from the N3C RECOVER team, is critical. Efforts must focus on making diagnoses and treatments more accessible to all demographics, particularly those currently underdiagnosed. Furthermore, enhancements of SDoH data within these systems \31\ can be further leveraged to understand biases in available data for patients with limited access to care and identification of health disparities in long COVID diagnoses and treatment across sociodemographic areas. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \30\ About the Cancer MoonshotSM--NCI. https://www.cancer.gov/ research/key--initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative/about (2022). 3.

This includes people in rural areas, low-income groups, and racial --------------------------------------------------------------------------- minorities who have limited access to healthcare. 5. Structuring of Clinical Note and Flowsheet Data: Ensuring that more data, such as SDoH data and complete symptom lists, become structured and easily accessible is vital for comprehensive research and analysis. 6. Linking Prospective Data with Clinical Trials and Other Datasets: More prospective data should be linked to clinical repositories using Privacy-Preserving Record Linkage (PPRL) to clinical trials data. Additionally, integrating this data with claims and mortality data will provide a more complete picture of various treatments' long-term impacts and effectiveness \33\. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \33\ Fernandez-de-las-Peas, C., Palacios-Cea, D., Gomez-Mayordomo, V., Cuadrado, M. L. & Florencio, L. L. Defining Post-COVID Symptoms (Post-Acute COVID, Long COVID, Persistent Post-COVID): An Integrative Classification. Int. J. Environ. Res. Public. Health 18, 2621 (2021). By focusing on these areas, the moonshot initiative can significantly advance our understanding of long COVID, leading to more effective treatments and better outcomes for those affected. ______  Large-scale Electronic Health Record (EHR) networks have been essential in advancing our understanding of long COVID, mainly due to their extensive patient health information and coverage of diverse patient populations. This diversity is key for studying long COVID's impact across different groups. However, using EHR data for research presents challenges like incomplete patient records, with events like external clinic visits or home COVID tests often missing. This issue is partially addressed through privacy-preserving linkage between healthcare systems and integrating billing data sources. EHR networking efforts, such as the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), are crucial in overcoming observational data limitations, such as the lack of standardization in EHR systems. Large networks have been instrumental in implementing harmonization pipelines and promoting data standardization at the national level, thus enhancing the reliability and comparability of research findings on long COVID. Identifying patients with long COVID in Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems presents a significant challenge as the condition is underdiagnosed. Analysis of the use of the ICD-10-CM long COVID code in the N3C system revealed demographic disparities in long COVID diagnoses, emphasizing the need for greater accessibility in diagnosis and treatment. Pfaff et al. developed a machine learning model showing high accuracy in classifying COVID-19 patients as having long COVID, while a nationwide observational cohort study focused on self-reported symptoms like fatigue and brain fog to define Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). Research using EHR data warehouses has been pivotal in understanding COVID-19 and Long COVID (PASC), revealing key symptoms and risk factors. Studies like Sudre CH et al.'s review have identified common symptoms, while others, like Zang et al.'s work with INSIGHT and OneFlorida+, show variability in post-COVID conditions across different populations. To further characterize long COVID, Reese et al. used computational modeling to classify patients into six distinct clusters, and Pfaff et al. analyzed data from thousands of patients, categorizing symptom co-occurences. These methods are crucial in developing targeted patient profiles for future research and treatment strategies. There is a significant intersection in symptomology between Post- Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC or long COVID) and a spectrum of related chronic conditions, notably myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The emergence of long COVID has cast a spotlight on these conditions, underscoring the urgent need for more research into their shared characteristics and underlying mechanisms. There is a critical need for a ``moonshot'' initiative to tackle long COVID. The scarcity of clinical trials focusing on long COVID's underlying causes and treatments pose a barrier to progress. A call to action by patients and researchers proposes that the U.S. government leads this initiative with a significant annual investment, similar to the successful Cancer Moonshot program, to inspire global action against this widespread health challenge. Key priorities for the moonshot initiative include conducting clinical trials for experimental treatments, identifying symptom sub- phenotypes, improving diagnosis and treatment accessibility, and establishing clinical guidelines for consistent diagnosis. Additionally, it emphasizes coordinated clinical programs for underserved communities, structuring clinical data for better research, and linking EHR systems with clinical trials and other datasets. These efforts aim to advance the understanding and treatment of long COVID, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes. ______  The Chair. Dr. Madlock, I want to thank you very much. Our next witness will be Dr. Tiffany Walker, Assistant Professor at Emory University School of Medicine. Dr. Walker, thanks very much for being here. STATEMENT OF TIFFANY WALKER, M.D., ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, EMORY UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, ATLANTA, GA Dr. Walker. Thank you so much. Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and distinguished Members of the Committee, my name is Tiffany Walker, and I am Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine at Emory, staff physician at Grady Memorial Hospital, a large urban safety net hospital. I am site PI for Recover a medic cohort and PI multiple clinical trials in long COVID, as well as the PI for the AHRQ Atlanta Long COVID Collaborative Center of Excellence. The views I express today are my own and do not reflect the views of my employer. I am honored to provide this testimony today, and I aim to convey how imperative it is that we continue to invest and support research to defining the biological drivers of long COVID and the urgency to identify effective treatments. We have seen that anywhere from 15 to 38 percent of COVID survivors develop long COVID. To provide a stark comparison, this is commensurate to the rate of diabetes in our population. Long COVID can significantly impact patients' quality of life and function, and long haulers are more likely to be unemployed and work reduced hours, which has been addressed multiple times today, with recent CDC data supporting that over a quarter of long haulers suffer from significant activity limitations. Disease duration remains unknown. However, mounting evidence supports significant overlap with infection associated chronic illnesses such as ME/CFS and dysautonomia. These are debilitating diseases that for many last lifelong. Economically disadvantaged populations have been disproportionately affected by long COVID, with African American and Hispanic Americans experiencing higher rates of long COVID, and nuanced diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Impaired health literacy in economically disadvantaged populations impacts recognition of symptoms and therefore access to care. Furthermore, lack of coordination in long COVID care is amplified in these underserved, minority populations that have longstanding history of poor access to affordable, quality health care. We absolutely see this in our Grady population. However, long COVID is not limited to this population. Although young, previously healthy adults have largely been spared from severe illness in the setting of acute COVID, it is important to highlight that long COVID can cause illness in anyone, and I think that we saw this today in our panel. Previously, healthy patients who had mild acute COVID infections make up a significant portion of the patients we are seeing in our long COVID clinics. In fact, CDC data suggests that adults aged 30 to 60 may be at highest risk, impacting our working age adults and those of childbearing ages. Congress investment in the Recovery Initiative well positions researchers like myself to define the clinical scope of long-COVID and characterize biological drivers of this disease. This is critical because a comprehensive understanding of the organ systems involved can guide clinical care. It can mitigate the unnecessary spending on extensive diagnostic workups, which is happening all the time. And defining these biological drivers helps us identify biomarkers that we can use to diagnose and monitor long-COVID, which I know has been addressed already, as well as it helps facilitate identification of intervenable targets for drug development. This is very important. We need to know what we are targeting. However, at this time, NIHLBI anticipates concluding the cohort in May 2025. This decision does not account for the ongoing high COVID-19 case rate, protracted nature of long COVID symptoms, or concerning evidence of potential, immunodeficiency that warrants long term monitoring in this population. Now is not the time to de-escalate funding for long COVID. Likewise, the Recovery Initiative hosts well-designed clinical trials. However, current funding is largely siloed through the Recover mechanism, stifling opportunities for further innovation. Despite Recover's best effort, the trials are often launching sequentially because there are finite resources for one institution to run all high profile clinical trials for the entire U.S. population. Trial funding needs to occur at a much greater scale and should not be limited to one consortium. Seasoned clinical trialists and long COVID experts providing care on the ground level should have input. I propose leveraging real world data to capture patterns of off label drug use to identify promising candidates that can be rapidly deployed in adaptive platform clinical trials. This winner take all trial design expedites drug development by using real time data to reallocate patients to drug showing efficacy and retire drug showing futility. This results in reduced patients on placebo, reduced cost, reduced timelines. This model shows significant promise for sustainable infrastructure that could be rapidly scaled to identify treatments for future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, bolstering preparedness. In summary, my recommendations are to expand Recover Initiative funding to support extension of the observational cohort. Expand funding for long COVID adaptive platform repurposed drug trials independent of the Recover mechanism. Then, in closing, I would like to extend my humble gratitude to Senator Kaine and colleagues for advocating for the AHRQ Long COVID Initiative. This is a 5-year effort that supports essential infrastructure to expand person centered long COVID care across the U.S., and we feel strongly that this support will be paramount in improving care, access, and quality, and will guide policy change in long COVID care delivery. Thank you so much.  prepared statement of tiffany walker Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and Distinguished Members of the Committee: My name is Tiffany Walker, and I am an assistant professor of internal medicine at Emory University. The views I express today are my own views and do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer, the RECOVER consortium, or AHRQ. I am honored to have the opportunity to share my testimony with you, and I hope to convey that Long COVID is a highly prevalent and often disabling disease. It is imperative that we continue to invest in and support research that defines the pathobiological drivers of this disease, and there is real urgency to identify effective treatments. To review my experience in this field, I co-founded the Long COVID clinic at Grady Memorial Hospital. I serve as site principal investigator (PI) for the NHLBI RECOVER Initiative meta cohort and RECOVER VITAL (Paxlovid) clinical trial, and co-investigator for the RECOVER SLEEP (Modafinil/Solriamfetol) clinical trial and the NIA REVERSE-LC (Baricitinib) clinical trial. I lead the Atlanta Long COVID Collaborative, a consortium of Long COVID providers and subspecialists in Atlanta and our site serves as a AHRQ Long COVID Center of Excellence. Additionally, I investigate health disparities and pathobiological mechanisms driving Long COVID. Impact on the labor force The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a conservative estimate of 20 million U.S. cases of Long COVID. \1\ In fact, we have seen that 15 percent of those exposed to COVID-19 go on to develop long term sequelae. \2\ To provide a stark comparison, this is commensurate to the rate of diabetes mellitus in our population, \3\ a disease that receives substantial healthcare and research funding support. Long COVID can lead to significant impairments in quality of life and function. \4\, \5\, \6\ We know that long haulers are more likely to be unemployed or work reduced hours, with one estimate reporting nearly half were unable to work full time due to severity of symptoms and nearly a quarter were unable to return to work at all. \7\ This is corroborated by recent CDC data showing that over a quarter of long haulers suffer from significant activity limitations. This level of disability also mirrors that seen in diabetes, for which $30 billion of indirect costs is spent annually on reduced employment due to disability. \8\ The duration of this disease remains unknown; \9\ however, there is mounting evidence supporting significant overlap between Long COVID and pre-existing infection-associated chronic diseases such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and dysautonomia, which are known to be debilitating and can persist in individuals indefinitely. \10\, \11\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ Ford ND, Slaughter D, Edwards D, et al.

Primary care physicians are unprepared to provide this novel and labor-intensive clinical care. Patients are often referred to multiple subspecialty providers without answers. Lack of understanding of Long COVID among clinicians contributes to increased testing, delays in diagnosis, and impairment of triage to appropriate services further compounding healthcare spending burden and barriers to access. Long haulers continue to experience stigmatization from the community and clinicians who do not acknowledge it as a real disease despite objective pathobiological data establishing it as a distinct entity. \27\, \28\ This lack of awareness can lead to feelings of isolation among long haulers and can have significant impacts on mental health in conjunction with the psychological stress from new-onset disability. \29\ High rates of anxiety, depression, and PTSD are observed in this population and behavioral health services are often limited and disconnected. \30\, \31\, \32\ Dedicated Long COVID clinics are equipped to provide this specialty care; however, these clinics remain rare and numbers continue to dwindle as clinics are shuttering. In the remaining Long COVID clinics, services are saturated due to high referral volumes. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \27\ List JM, Long TG.

Through iterative programmatic evaluations, this consortium seeks to optimize Long COVID clinical management and guide healthcare policy. At each site, Long COVID teams will engage with the community to increase community-based referrals and ensure the needs of the population are met. Long COVID experts have designed robust peer education series to build capacity for Long COVID care throughout their region. We are grateful for the funding Congress provides to support AHRQ in this initiative, and we are grateful to AHRQ for prioritizing this important work to bridge clear gaps in Long COVID care quality. There is great value in establishing and supporting these Long COVID Centers of Excellence during these first 10 years, and we request continued support of this initiative. In addition to these centers, given the substantial prevalence of Long COVID, the permanence of COVID-19 in our environment, and the saturation of Long COVID clinics, it is imperative to support efforts to ensure primary care providers are appropriately trained and are competent to provide Long COVID care, with the ultimate goal of decentralization to ensure sufficient care access. There are multiple networks of Long COVID providers independent of the AHRQ Learning Community that are eager to contribute to this capacity building effort, and we request additional funding through AHRQ to bolster these activities, including primary care roadshows, development of adaptable protocols that can be implemented in community clinic settings, Project ECHO presentations, Long COVID podcasts and webinars. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \33\ AHRQ.

RECOVER Initiative: A reason for hope and a reason for concern Important steps have been taken to advance our understanding of Long COVID. Notably, Congress's investment in the RECOVER Initiative meta cohort has resulted in a successful demonstration of team-based science, with enrollment of over 14,000 patients in a little over 1 year and publications of meaningful data on Long COVID definition and phenotypes.9 The robust infrastructure and data collection from this study well-positions investigators to define the clinical scope of Long COVID and characterize underlying mechanisms driving symptomatology. Meeting these objectives is critical as comprehensive understanding of organ system involvement can guide clinical care by mitigating unnecessary spending on diagnostic work-ups. Defining pathobiological pathways not only serves to promote credence of disease validity, but it also identifies biomarkers for Long COVID diagnosis and monitoring and defines intervenable targets for drug development. However, at this time, NHLBI anticipates concluding the cohort in May 2025, which is insufficient time to fully characterize this complex multisystemic disease and precludes long-term follow-up to monitor disease trajectory. This decision does not account for the ongoing high COVID- 19 case rate, the protracted nature of Long COVID symptoms, or the concerning evidence of immune dysregulation observed in this population, including evidence of fatigability of T-and B-cell lineages that may indicate impending immunodeficiency that warrants long-term monitoring. \35\, \36\ Despite the lack of coordinated, robust COVID-19 surveillance, we can estimate from wastewater analysis that new cases are occurring at very high levels and continuing to rise. \37\ In fact, this may be the second largest COVID-19 surge to-date with an estimated 2 million cases per day peaking the second week of January 2024. \38\ Now is not the time to deescalate funding for Long COVID. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \35\ Peluso MJ, Deitchman AN, Torres L, et al.

A call for expansion of Long COVID clinical trials Likewise, the RECOVER Initiative provides infrastructure for platform clinical trials hosted through the Duke Clinical Research Institute. These well-designed trials target evidence-based Long COVID manifestations and offer promising drug candidates that have potential for cure or for chronic symptom management. However, current funding for clinical trials is largely siloed through the RECOVER mechanism, stifling opportunities for further innovation. Given the prevalence and functional impact of this disease, funding for clinical trials needs to occur at a much greater scale and should not be limited to one institution or consortium. Despite RECOVER's best effort to roll out platform trials in parallel instead of in series, trials are launching sequentially because, despite admirable effort, there are finite resources for one institution to run all high-profile clinical trials for the U.S. population. In addition, these trials are designed as platform trials that allow multiple interventions to be trialed in tandem; however, many of the trials are only investigating 1-2 interventions at a time. Seasoned clinical trialists and Long COVID clinicians providing care on the ground level should have input into the treatments trialed in this patient population. Innovative and efficient approaches to clinical trials Several repurposed drugs have been investigated in the management of acute COVID-19, originating from a top-down approach to rapidly identify therapeutic options and mitigate severe outcomes. However, nearly 4 years from the pandemic onset, the same top-down approach has not been prioritized for Long COVID and as a result, there remain no effective, FDA-approved treatments. Investigating existing drugs as therapeutic options repurposed to treat Long COVID can safely expedite the timeline of identification, development, and time to market. I collaborate with the CURE Drug Repurposing Collaboratory, a public- private partnership between Critical Path Institute (C-Path) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in partnership with the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). We propose leveraging real-world data prospectively available from Long COVID patients and clinicians to identify promising repurposed drugs poised for rapid translation into patient-centered clinical trials. Real-world data, much like the CURE ID effort supported by the FDA/ NCATS: Cure.ncats.io, can capture patterns of off-label uses of medications routinely occurring within and outside of the clinic, providing hypothesis generation that support rapid evaluation of common drugs in pragmatic clinical trials. \39\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \39\ von Delft A, Hall MD, Kwong AD, et al.

Jul 2023;22(7):585-603. doi:10.1038/s41573-023-00692-8 Adaptive platform clinical trials Adaptive platform clinical trials have an innovative design that allows for drug development expediency. This approach evaluates multiple drugs simultaneously, often with drugs administered in combination and with multiple drugs being compared to a single, common control. Adaptive designs use accruing, using real-time data to reallocate patients to drugs showing efficacy and retire drugs showing futility. As research uncovers novel pathophysiologic insights, treatments can be integrated seamlessly in this design. In contrast, traditional trials use fixed treatment arms, and data are typically not analyzed until trial completion, often years after trial initiation. This may result in a trial design that has insufficient patient enrollment to estimate the effect of the treatment. Advantages of adaptive platform design include smaller number of participants, reduced patients on placebo, reduced costs, reduced timelines, and better inferences for regulators and researchers. These trials designs are gaining popularity following successes such as REMAP-CAP, ANTICOV, and ACTIV6. \40\, \41\, \42\, \43\ Furthermore, many of these trials can be conducted remotely. Decentralized trials can enroll and complete all study visits through telemedicine, expanding participant network beyond institution-based recruitment. Traditional trials are predominately limited to recruitment of subjects who seek care at large academic institutions. In decentralized trials, participants throughout participating states will be able to enroll, promoting recruitment of marginalized populations with limited healthcare access as well as those with debilitating Long COVID symptoms which limit travel to study sites. Additionally, this model allows for a more demographically diverse study population, promoting inclusion of populations that are typically underrepresented in institution-based trials, such as rural and urban populations. This approach facilitates representative recruitment and ensures the greatest impact for those affected by this disease. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \40\ Angus DC, Derde L, Al-Beidh F, et al.

As mentioned previously, funding for adaptive clinical trials in the Long COVID space is limited and primarily siloed to the RECOVER Initiative. There is concern in scientific and patient communities that interest in funding Long COVID research may be waning. In addition, the novelty of these approaches can be challenging for regulatory bodies who have limited precedence to provide guidance and approval. I have encountered this difficulty engaging with the FDA on a sponsor-investigator adaptive repurposed drugs trial. Despite their many advantages and gain in popularity, regulators remain unsure of how to interpret data from adaptive trials, impeding drug development and approval for market. In addition, there is no FDA division specific to Long COVID and recommendations across Long COVID studies have proven to be disparate and inconsistent. Summary of recommendations: 1. Expand RECOVER Initiative funding to support extension of the observational cohort. 2. Expand funding for Long COVID adaptive platform repurposed drug trials, independent of the RECOVER mechanism. 3. Request a report from FDA detailing protocols for expedited Long COVID drug development and strategic planning for support of adaptive platform clinical trials. 4. Continue funding for AHRQ Long COVID Initiatives and expand resources for education and capacity building among primary care providers. 5. Establish a new institute at NIH to address Long COVID, ME/CFS, and other infection-associated chronic diseases. ______  Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and Members of the Committee: My name is Tiffany Walker, and I am an assistant professor of internal medicine.

Impact on Labor Force. We see that 15 percent of COVID-19 infected people develop Long COVID. \1\ To provide a stark comparison, this is commensurate to the rate of diabetes in our population. \2\ Long COVID can significant impact a patient's quality of life and function. \3\ Long haulers are more likely to be unemployed or work reduced hours with recent CDC data showing that over a quarter of long haulers suffer from significant activity limitations. Disease duration remains unknown; \4\, \5\, \6\, however, mounting evidence supports significant overlap with infection-associated chronic illness such as ME/CFS and dysautonomia, debilitating diseases that can last lifelong. \7\, \8\, \9\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ Perlis RH, Santillana M, Ognyanova K, et al.

This is critical as a comprehensive understanding of organ system involvement can guide clinical care, mitigating unnecessary spending on extensive diagnostic work-ups. Defining biological drivers helps us identify biomarkers that we can use to diagnose and monitor Long COVID, and it facilitates identification of intervenable targets for drug development. However, at this time, NHLBI anticipates concluding the cohort in May 2025. This decision does not account for the ongoing high COVID-19 case rate, the protracted nature of Long COVID symptoms, or concerning evidence of potential immunodeficiency that warrants long-term monitoring. \20\, \21\ Now is not the time to deescalate funding for Long COVID. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \20\ Peluso MJ, Deitchman AN, Torres L, et al.

However, current funding is largely siloed through the RECOVER mechanism, stifling opportunities for further innovation. Despite RECOVER's best effort, trials are launching sequentially because there are finite resources for one institution to run all high- profile clinical trials for the U.S. population. Trial funding needs to occur at a much greater scale and should not be limited to one consortium. Seasoned trialists and Long COVID experts providing care on the ground level should have input. I propose leveraging real-world data to capture patterns of off-label drug use to identify promising candidates that can be rapidly deployed in adaptive platform clinical trials. This winner-takes-all trial design expedites drug development by using real-time data to reallocate patients to drugs showing efficacy and retire drugs showing futility. This results in reduced patients on placebo, reduced costs, and reduced timelines. \22\, \23\, \24\, \25\ This model demonstrates significant promise for sustainable infrastructure that can be rapidly scaled to efficiently identify treatments in future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \22\ Angus DC, Derde L, Al-Beidh F, et al.

First, I am going to offer an apology. I have got an emergency leadership meeting in a while, and I am going to have to run out to, and I will give the seat here over to Senator Baldwin. Let me start off with, which it goes without saying I think that many of us understand that at a time when we have, a, have a major disease which has been under discussed, underappreciated, that while we have put some Federal funding and some good work has been done, much more needs to be done. To my point, that is a given. All right. But what I want to go beyond that and instead ask all of you, starting with Dr. Harkins, is if I am an individual with long COVID, as people in this room are and people in another room are, the overflow room, what--give us some optimism here. Where do you think we can be going--are we seeing any breakthroughs in terms of understanding the disease and in providing, in reasonably short term, some treatments for people who are hurting very badly right now? Dr. Harkins? Dr. Harkins. Thank you. Well, I know we all want answers yesterday because patients are suffering. I think looking globally and with the studies that are going on currently in the U.S., we are finding answers. We are finding trends. We are clustering patients into different subgroups. However, this is really complex and as my colleagues have mentioned, it affects every organ system. All different cells are involved. Trying to come up with a one size fits all is not going to work. And so, I think we are learning more about muscle dysfunction and the post exertional malaise patients, for example. Now what we do with that information--there is actual structural damage that occurs post exercise. So, what we do with that information now will be critical in what can we do to address that and improve their symptoms at the time. Educating providers so that the patients are heard and felt like they have a partner in this. The Chair. Thanks. Dr. Al-Aly. Dr. Al-Aly. We have made a lot of improvement--a lot of progress in understanding the biology of long COVID. We understand what happens in the brain, for example, in a lot of patients with long COVID, low cortisol level, low serotonin level, fusion of the neurons that actually disrupt cognition. And neuroinflammation or inflammation in the brain and some structural abnormalities in the brain have been documented in people following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our understanding--I mean, that is really only to talk about the brain. There is a lot of issues on the heart and other aspects. But we have made a lot of--improvement or progress in understanding the biology of long COVID. Also, we don't understand quite a bit the epidemiology of long COVID. We understand that vaccines work--reduce the risk of long COVID. We understand that to some extent antivirals also reduce the risk of long COVID. We also understand that reinfection raises the risk of long COVID. So, all of that understanding should feed in into some optimism that we have made some progress. I think the major, major, sort of a--we note lack of progress in clinical trials. As I indicated, they are too slow and too small to yield definitive answers. Really, for the person who is hurting from long COVID, they need that treatment yesterday. And we have--you know, while we made progress in understanding the biology and epidemiology of long COVID, we definitely need trials and at scale that match the urgency of the problem. The Chair. Dr. Madlock-Brown. Dr. Madlock-Brown. Yes. I would like to just reiterate what the other witnesses have said that there is a lot that we understand about the biology. We do know that the clinical trials have been slow. There are some instances in which there have been issues with some of the treatments that are recommended for long COVID. In the early days, exercise was often recommended, even for patients that--without testing for post exertional malaise. There--I think there--right now we are really in a phase where there are about, I think, 12--there are 12 trials that are registered in clinicaltrials.gov that are working on experimental medicines. I think that we really need investment in this direction to really identify treatments that are working for patients. The Chair. Dr. Walker. Dr. Walker. Yes. To reiterate what many of the last panel mentioned, we have seen a lot of these patients that have really not been validated by their primary care providers or subspecialists. That is because in our illness script, as physicians, when we see a normal physical exam, we see a normal diagnostic workup, we are left with, oh, it seems like everything is okay. And clearly it is not. Just to reiterate, understanding the path of biological mechanisms not only helps us target medications. It helps us understand the disease, but also provides credence to this disease. We can now point to something. This is a real disease. It cannot be refuted. There is scientific evidence of this. And so, I think that is something that is really exciting, that gives us hope. But again, it gives us targets that we can use in drug trials. The Chair. Okay. I am assuming that--my time is running out. I am assuming that all of you believe that the Federal Government has got to play a much more active role with substantial sums of money for research, development, clinical trials, etcetera. Is that correct? Dr. Harkins. Yes. Dr. Al-Aly. Absolutely, yes. Dr. Madlock-Brown. Yes. Dr. Walker. No doubt. The Chair. Okay. All right. Senator Cassidy. Senator Cassidy. I will defer to Senator Murkowski. Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member. Thank you all for your testimony here today. Dr. Harkins, I want to ask a question related to those who are struggling with long COVID in, rural areas. As you know, my state is pretty rural. In addition to extraordinarily rural, we are also home to over half of our Country's federally recognized tribes. We got about 80 percent of our communities that are not on a road system, so access to care is always a challenge. But you had raised that recent CDC data marks more than 5,000 deaths from long COVID. While long COVID death rates vary by race and ethnicity, they were the highest among American Indians and Alaska Natives. I would ask if you are aware of any research efforts that have been focused specifically on American Indians, Alaska Native population? I appreciate that it may be that the challenge has just been that access to that care, whether for diagnosis, for any level of ongoing care, may have challenged it. But if you can speak to any research efforts that you are aware of, and then what your recommendations for ensuring that, in just more of the marginalized populations, specifically in our rural communities, receive the diagnosis and then the follow on treatment with regards to long COVID? Dr. Harkins. Yes. Thank you for your question. In New Mexico, also very rural state with a large population of Native American as well, we don't have a very specific trial or focus just on our American Indian and Native Alaskan population. I think historically maybe we have not done well with the research on this population. I think building a better partnership with our indigenous tribes and other tribal communities to want to help and share and listen to their input as to what is needed for clinical trials and other things in their community. I think they have to drive miles and miles and miles to come to a center. Senator Murkowski. Or they can't drive at all. Dr. Harkins. Or they can't drive at all, or they don't have money for gas. Exactly. And there is also the distrust of the research system. I think coming to them, going to their communities in a partnership and maybe talking with them or getting the other folks to--you know, at least listening, listening and understanding what is needed and how can we encourage their participation. Senator Murkowski. Let me ask about the opportunities through telehealth. You had highlighted HRSA's telehealth technology enabled learning program initiative to help train local providers to identify patients with long COVID, and then, to work with the coordination. In Alaska, clearly, our community health centers are a critical component of our health care system. They really played a very key role in addressing the COVID pandemic. Can you share any examples of how Recover grantees can use technologies in perhaps new or different ways to advance best practices, but really to allow for increased access to these clinical services, again, through partnerships. Because the distances aren't going to get any closer. If you don't have roads, to your point, the ability to fly is cost prohibitive. So, we are talking about ongoing access and other partnerships through perhaps telehealth and others, and our community health centers. Dr. Harkins. Sure. You know, through our project Echo program, we reach many providers and trying to educate them. But I think also we need to have access for patients to actually visit with physicians in a multidisciplinary COVID clinic. That is going to take a lot of the work to do. But I think having education, broadband technology also is an issue. Getting that to the patient's homes. But I think setting up regional centers where potentially the primary care provider that is in that community can be a partner in the learning loops and then being able to understand the diagnosis and then take that to their patient. I think that telehealth is really going to be the answer for educating the providers that can then bring the treatments and recommendations to their patients in their communities that are very rural, so that the provider is the treater, and the patients don't have to come to the bigger, academic center. Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you. Senator Baldwin. Senator Baldwin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank this panel of witnesses. I also want to thank the previous panel of witnesses for coming here, for telling your stories, and keeping this front and center. We have to do that. With zero FDA approved medications for people who are suffering from long COVID--we just know people are suffering and we have to increase the sense of urgency. I want to ask a couple of specific questions. As several of our witnesses today have noticed, it is vital that we continue to support research into our long COVID, to better understand, prevent, and treat the disease. Congress has previously allocated $1.15 billion to fund NIH research on long COVID through a multi-pronged research network. However, I know that NIH has received critical feedback regarding its approach to this research, including the fear that it may not deliver any meaningful treatments to people suffering from long COVID. I want to ask a couple of you to describe any concerns you might have with the NIH Recover program and highlight the possible opportunities for oversight and accountability within this program so that the NIH can better respond to the needs of patients with long COVID. I want to add just a little bit to Dr. Harkins, you talked about one approach to--looking at clusters since this is multisystem. On the other hand, Dr. Al-Aly, you talked about an institute for greater number of infection associated chronic illnesses that have--that are complex and multi-systemic in nature. It is kind of like, you are taking it apart, you are putting more together. I just want to hear a little bit more about where you would take that. Dr. Harkins and Dr. Al-Aly. Dr. Harkins. Thank you. I think the Recover Initiative is really trying to gather data and follow patients and really understand the disease. We want to be able to do treatments, and the treatment trials are taking a while to get going, yes. But the problem is one treatment isn't going to be available to fix everything, right. So, all of these patients, we need to find out, well, what is driving the post exertional malaise? What are the drivers for the respiratory and the cardiac complications? Then, how can we devise research treatment plans for both of those? Because doing one thing and then having everybody join in, you are not going to see a result, I think. You have to have it very clarified for your specific patient population to see a benefit, is my feeling. That is going to take time, unfortunately. And that is what everyone is frustrated with. Senator Baldwin. Right. Dr. Al-Aly. I think the major question that we need to really solve is that why acute infection. So, we have trivialized for centuries--for centuries we trivialize acute infections. Why acute infection in some cases lead to chronic disease. I think this pandemic is telling us, it is giving us really clues that SARS-CoV-2 infection--and most people, they do just fine. But some people succumb to long COVID. Then we look back in the history books, it actually happened after the flu. It actually--you know, look at ME/CFS. It is also thought to be driven by a viral illness. So, I think the solution here is to try to really more deeply understand why acute infections lead to chronic disease. This requires really a comprehensive approach to really understand the mechanisms of why viruses actually produce acute infection, lead to chronic disease, understand the epidemiology, and also dissect therapeutic pathways. This really requires an all hands on deck situation and really a broad, comprehensive approach, interdisciplinary approach that should be solved, in my view, in the form of a new institute to tackle this issue. This will not only help you address the issue of long COVID. It will also help us solve the puzzle of ME/CFS and all other infection associated chronic conditions that have been ignored for decades and help us prepare for the next pandemic. So, one thing, one certainty in life is that we are going to be hit with another pandemic. We just don't know if this is going to be 5 years from now, 10 years from now, or 30 years from now. And it is important that we learn the lessons from this virus today to really face the rough waters of future pandemics. We would be all in failure if we--if our children face a future pandemic and get hit with another long something--long virus in 2030 or something, and they don't know how to treat it. That would represent our collective failure. And we really, really need to understand this now, and I think this is really--the time is now to understand infection associated chronic diseases. Senator Baldwin. Thank you. I ran out of time for my question for Dr. Walker, but maybe I will stick around and see if we can get another round. Senator Hickenlooper. Senator Cassidy. Senator Baldwin. Thank you. Oh my goodness. All right, so last year, we came together to provide $10 million in new funding for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Qualities, patient centered, coordinated care for those living with long COVID, including new care models. I was proud to work with colleagues to continue this funding in our proposed Senate Fiscal Year 2024 bill, and I certainly want to work with our colleagues in the House to get this over the finish line. But Dr. Walker, can you talk about the importance of that AHRQ funding for long COVID and the gaps that would exist without it? Dr. Walker. Yes. Thank you so much for that question and thank you so much for advocating for that funding. I think it will be really essential in being able to expand the care that we provide to long COVID patients. Just to give a context, it is a multi-systemic, complex disease and primary care physicians at this stage are unprepared to manage this novel disease. It is an extensive workup for these patients and labor intensive. These patients, as you have already heard, are oftentimes past back and forth between subspecialists because of this multi-systemic nature. And I have heard of patients seeing 30 subspecialists before they make it to a long COVID clinic. Yes, that is absolutely true. And so, these extensive diagnostic workups that come with this as well is burdensome for the patient, burdensome for the health care system, and long COVID clinics are equipped to see these patients. The problem with that is we are rare. Many of us are closing doors. The clinics are dwindling. So, having the support is really important, especially since we receive these referrals and we become pretty saturated in our clinics to be able to see these patients. So, this initiative is a 5-year initiative that funds nine long COVID centers of excellence across the U.S., so it has a demographically distributed population. And what we are able to do with it is really expand care. We are able to hire additional staff, care coordination staff, so it is really a person centered, coordinated care model. We are very interested in the patient voice and have patient advisory committees. We are engaging with the community and community allies so we know what the community feels about long COVID, how we can increase community based referrals, and that we are meeting the needs of the community. It also includes a component where we have an iterative evaluation component, again, with the patient voice, so that we can continue to improve these care models for long COVID and then hopefully guide policy. Then the last thing I will mention is because I mentioned the primary care physicians and just a lack of understanding of long COVID, there is a very robust plan in place to provide peer education through Echo, through primary care roadshows, through webinars, and multiple education series. So, we are hoping to eventually decentralize the care of long COVID in the long run. Again, if 20 million individuals in the U.S. have long COVID, they can't be cared for only in these long COVID centers, yes. Senator Marshall. Right. Chairman, thank you so much. Let me--again, if you hear frustration, it is my voice. It is-- because one of my very closest loved one has been incapacitated for 2 years. We are one of those families where our loved one has seen 30 doctors. And if you can find--there are not many COVID--long COVID clinics around. But let me add my frustration with the NIH. As Senator Baldwin pointed out, we gave them over $1 billion December 2020. They have been focused on, as I call it, forming committees and praying about it. But they are focused on risk factors and causes as opposed to diagnosis and treatment. I really--for Senator Sanders' team, I think we should have NIH come in--and I am not pointing--I am pointing a finger, but it is their processes. They are not streamlined. I think you give somebody $1 billion, we could have some studies done on diagnosis and treatment. I would suggest that this Committee maybe giving this type of money more to BARDA which seems to be more streamlined, more focused on working with the private sector. We keep repeating the same mistakes. We can't take 2 years just to get geared up. I hope we come back with NIH. We talked about funding BARDA somehow, someway. You know, at its core, long COVID is a vascular disease. It is about immune dysfunction. It is almost like an autoimmune reaction gone crazy, and the spiked proteins, the pathogen. We know that. From the doctors on the cutting edge in the private sector, they are getting cytokine panels and coagulation workups, plasminogen activation inhibitors, fibrin monomer dimers. There is micro-clots going on, too small for us to see on the typical scans that we would use. Those are the types of things I wish we were studying to say, well, here is normal. Here is what is happening in COVID patients. Those types of things. Dr. Al-Aly, are you doing any of those types of bloodwork, these cytokine panels, that type of thing? Dr. Al-Aly. Not in my lab, but I definitely endorse the idea that we need to just find out, find treatments as soon as possible. That is very, very important. The research enterprise should be oriented to address the problems that people care about most, which is early treatment. Definitely agree. Senator Marshall. Right. But if you--it would be great if in the primary care setting if there was a long COVID panel. That is what, like a hepatitis panel, we need a long COVID panel, and then our primary care doctors could identify this and say, yes, indeed. Then maybe based upon that, we decide if we are going to use some off label drugs like Plaquenil, or maybe we are using acyclovir because we have stirred up the Epstein-Barr virus, that type of thing as well. Does anybody in the panel have any experience using off label drugs to treat this with some success? Plaquenil is what comes to mind to me. Dr. Walker, you are kind of shaking your head yes. Dr. Walker. Yes. I mean, there is some evidence for medications like low dose naltrexone that have already been used in the ME/CFS population. There is some observational data out of Stanford using this medication. It doesn't work for everybody but is very beneficial for some. I think that we need to focus not only on curative treatments, because of course that makes sense, but as you heard the panel say today, we just need medications that will cause some relief of symptoms as we are trying to learn more about this disease and find treatments for it. Senator Marshall. Okay. Dr. Al-Aly, are you using any medicines off label with success? Dr. Al-Aly. --endorse publicly. But again, the way we know about what works and what doesn't is to do trials. Senator Marshall. Yes. Dr. Al-Aly. I mean that is really how we know systematically what works and what doesn't, right. Anecdotally, there are a lot of things that people say that these things might work, but I think we need to accelerate trials, so we actually find out what works and what doesn't. Senator Marshall. I am all for the longitudinal studies. And of course those take years as opposed to days. I think that we could even start with just some retrospective studies in the machine learning to say, okay, what patients have been given Plaquenil, what patients have been given acyclovir? The--which one is it, Neurontin? Dr. Walker. Low dose naltrexone. Senator Marshall. Naltrexone as well. Some of those just as see. And yes, I am all for the longitudinals, but desperate times call for desperate measures and doctors can't be persecuted for--you know, I use off label medicines every day, but it seems like if you use off label medicines in COVID, you are going to go to COVID hell and be censored. So, it is--I don't get what the double standard is all about. Dr. Al-Aly. Senator, we are on the same page. We actually believe very firmly in the value of observational research to really inform a lot of our policy discussions. But at the same time, we also need to really accelerate the conduct of trials so we actually definitively know what works and what doesn't. Those are complementary approaches. And we definitely--my lab, most of my lab really runs on observational research, and I definitely endorse the idea that observational research can teach us a lot. As a matter of fact, it has taught us a lot about COVID and long COVID in the past 4 years. Most of the--what we know is from that line of research. So, we are on the same page. Senator Marshall. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Thank you. Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you. First, thank you all for-- -- Senator Cassidy. Well, hang on. I haven't gone yet. Are you going? Senator Hickenlooper. I haven't gone yet. Senator Cassidy. Oh, good.  Senator Cassidy. I thought you were going to wrap it up. Senator Hickenlooper. No. I would never think such a thing. Wouldn't even consider it, without checking to my--the co- Chair. Thank you all for coming. I know how busy you are and how seriously you take this. You have been--you really brought to light a number of different facets that haven't really been considered. I want to ask each of you, and we will start with you, Dr. Al-Aly, do you think there is potential of directing artificial intelligence-- I mean, we have heard so many different novel cases, sets of symptoms in different circumstances and all the different variables that go into the biotics of the gut, and we have all been hearing about. Do you think AI is a potential aid for--in diagnosis, being able to get a faster solution to diagnosis, but then also in terms of getting to some appropriate medications? Dr. Al-Aly. Absolutely, yes. AI can teach us a lot about the biology of long COVID. Why the virus, with its current structure and evolving structure, can actually lead to chronic damage. You know, definitely leveraging technologies like AI to solve this problem is really important. It can also help us identify therapeutic pathways and can really also sift through the trillions of data bits that are available to us in the U.S. to help us identify patterns and potentially also treatments at work. Leveraging--this is an all hands on deck situation. Leveraging technologies like AI, and actually the might of people who really do very well and very advanced AI to help us solve long COVID is going to be very, very important, definitely. Senator Hickenlooper. Anybody want to add something to that? Dr. Madlock-Brown. Yes. I would just like to add that AI systems like Open AI that we see right now, those are really successful because of the fact that we put everything on the internet all of our business, all the time, all the time. The problem with EHR systems is we don't have all this data structured. We don't all have it available in one place. If I am looking at patients in my system, I don't necessarily know every single health center they have been to. I don't know when they picked up their prescriptions. I don't know all of this information. And so, in order for observational systems to be able to leverage AI for this, they--we need a better investment in the data and information that is available, how it is centralized, how you are able to track and get a comprehensive picture for patients. Senator Hickenlooper. Absolutely. Anyone else? Dr. Harkins. I totally agree. I mean, our systems don't talk to each other, so we don't have all of the basic information of what patients have tried, etcetera, so AI has its limitations in that way. But I think that it could identify potentially agents that many patients are using and then take that forward for trials. Senator Hickenlooper. Right. I think that is the great possibility. Dr. Walker, do you want to add anything to that? Dr. Walker. Yes. And this is somewhat adjacent to that discussion. But similarly, FDA and NCATS already support a platform that allows capture of repurposed drug data of what people are using off label and physicians, and we can sort through this data to find medications that might be helpful, to be then deployed in randomized clinical trials. And so, not specifically AI, but a similar use of this existing real world data. Senator Hickenlooper. Yes. I think it does come back to what Dr. Madlock-Brown said in terms of N3C, you know--we got to get all the data connected, and be able to look at, without ever revealing a patient's name, but understanding how many different patients have had these different symptoms, have had these different conditions, have had micro clots, whatever the circumstances are, and begin to analyze that more carefully. Again, I will start with Dr. Al-Aly, do you think--we are going to get other pandemics. There is no question. For some reason, Congress doesn't seem willing to fund the basic preparation for--to be prepared for that next pandemic, which we are still working on. Well, I do believe we will get there. But should we also be looking at considering changes in some of the guidelines we issued for how we--transportation, how many air changes we have in an elevator or in an airplane, whether the new air comes in high or comes in low, buildings, how often the air changes. Is that--now that we are beginning to understand this type of pandemic and knowing we will get another, shouldn't we be considering more carefully how we build things in the future? Dr. Al-Aly. Yes, yes. So, investment in air filtration and ventilation, air filtration systems is going to be very, very important. Updating building codes to actually require that is going to be very important. Let me give you an example. We actually earthquake proof buildings for earthquakes that happen once every 50 years or 100 years. We invest millions of dollars in making buildings earthquake proof or seismically proof, right. Why can't we do the same thing to really make sure that our buildings are proof against natural hazards like airborne pathogens, right. So, this is very, very important. One of the lessons that we learned from this pandemic is that pathogens could be transmitted in the air, like SARS-CoV-2 or airborne pathogens. And one way to protect or to reduce the chance of transmission and infection is to clean the air in indoor buildings. One of the pathways to do that is investment and updating building codes to require better ventilation and air filtration systems. Senator Hickenlooper. I couldn't agree more. And think of all the auxiliary, the accessory--the health benefits we would get from those kinds of investments---- Dr. Al-Aly. There are studies demonstrating that actually kids perform better in schools when they have better air filtration, better ventilation systems. Like they actually perform better in schools. That has really been done. And again, we do the same thing for earthquakes. And in some instances, earthquakes don't have--. Senator Hickenlooper. With much less benefit---- Dr. Al-Aly. Absolutely, absolutely. Senator Hickenlooper. I see all four of you nodding your head, so I think we can say we have a consensus here in that. I am out of time, but I will come back. Since I am now sitting in for the Chair, I get to decide whether we keep you for a few minutes longer. I promise to put it to use. Senator Cassidy. Senator Cassidy. You give a man a microphone and all of a sudden you can't control them.  Senator Cassidy. Hey, thank you all. Thank you for what you are doing and for all of your physician colleagues and researcher colleagues whom you represent. I really appreciate that. So, my questions. I have got a bunch of them. First, I just want to make the point that there has been a lot of effort here, a lot of discussion about the NIH to do more to hopefully develop these therapeutics as rapidly as possible. I will point out something which is counterproductive, and which has been shown to be counterproductive, which is the most frustrating thing, which is the Administration is pushing that if there are cures with NIH money, that the Federal Government can march in and dictate whether or not the intellectual property is taken if they don't like the price. That has been shown in the past to inhibit investment by the private sector. And is very populist. It probably does well on the campaign trail. It is going to be bad for this. And I am just going to make that point because we have made it before, but maybe this is the time that it will actually mean something to people to actually promote development, as opposed to promote a populist appeal. Next, Dr. Harkins, a lot of conversation. Dr. Walker mentioned Project Echo too. You are from the hometown of Project Echo. How effective has Echo been in terms of transmitting--what is the uptake among primary care providers logging on to hear from you, or Dr. Walker, or whomever, as to how to better manage these patients? Dr. Harkins. Thank you for the question. You know, we have over 100 participants in this particular post-COVID primary care Echo program that we are running. I think---- Senator Cassidy. Now, participants are sites, or participants are individual physicians? Dr. Harkins. Individual participants, and the majority are practitioners. Senator Cassidy. 100 different doctors. Dr. Harkins. 800. Senator Cassidy. 800. I am sorry. Dr. Harkins. Yes, 800. And so, what we are seeking are case presentations from these patients, from the providers, but they were uncomfortable or not knowing how to diagnose long COVID. Is it long COVID? So, we have done case based presentations---- Senator Cassidy. I get that, but I have limited time. Dr. Harkins. Okay. So, we have efficacy data where they feel more comfortable. We are doing polls. They can actually answer the questions. Now, yes, this meets a long COVID diagnosis. Yes, this would be the next step to do. Senator Cassidy. Dr. Walker, you had said you need to decentralize the management of this. Are you finding these roadshows and these Echo programs decentralizing the management yet? Dr. Walker. These are just being launched now as AHRQ was just funded. I don't expect that it will be decentralized soon. And this is a 5-year endeavor, and I expect that we will need to have that for 5 years, if not longer. It is a very complex disease. But during these 5 years, it will be a very intensive capacity building effort amongst primary care physicians within our regions. Senator Cassidy. Sounds great. Doctor Al-Aly, let me just ask you because this begs to be answered. I have been sitting up here reading my PubMed. We do know that there is different pathological mechanisms by which it is theorized COVID would do this. In some cases, it is immunologic dysregulation, other places, it is gut dysbiosis, in other cases is thrombi. But there are specific treatments for each of those. For example, one of our witnesses said their daughter had been given a colonoscopy, put on probiotics, which could be irritable bowel syndrome superimposed, but nonetheless, it worked. I guess I am a little bit--and I know there is an answer for this. I presume the approach is, wait a second, here we have studies showing that thrombi are probably involved, and here, to the degree we can separate those two, it seems to be immunologic dysregulation, and here is something else. It seems like there could be a therapeutic intervention, even if not in a clinical trial, aimed on each of those. Is that being done? If so, what are the successes of this kind of personalized approach? Dr. Al-Aly. This is what gives me hope, is that our understanding of the mechanisms of long COVID has actually improved over time. And we know that there is gut dysbiosis. We know that there might have---- Senator Cassidy. Let me stop you though, because again, I got limited time, and he is going to--he is now the Chairman. But we have had some of this information for a couple of years now, and that is time enough for people--like, for example, the GI doc who ended up giving the patient the probiotics and making a positive improvement. To what degree has this information that we have had for 2 years been translated by clinicians into different approaches, even if it is empiric? Dr. Al-Aly. Very, very poorly. I think the broader--the provider community don't really have a very---- Senator Cassidy. Okay, then go--get back to the long COVID treatment centers, because we funded eight or nine of those. And so, how are those doing implementing this information? Dr. Al-Aly. Those are currently treating people symptomatically, and some of them may be trying sort of may be trying different treatments according to different mechanisms. But I think the really the core issue here is that the only really way, the only solid way we know treatments works is by doing RCTs or randomized controlled trials. Senator Cassidy. Oh, I get that totally. On the other hand, I think--it is maybe you, Dr. Madlock-Brown, who said we could do have the real world experience. And sometimes a RCT is stimulated by hey, look at this. In this subset of patients, this really seem to work, now let's check it. It isn't random by which you come up with a random---- Dr. Al-Aly. I think a lot of the anecdotal--that anecdotal evidence, and also the basic and mechanistic evidence, is informing the development of clinical trial. I think the point, though, is that the number of trials that are now currently planned or ongoing is too small and too slow and--to really yield a definitive answer in the time that we need them to. Senator Cassidy. Okay. Dr. Harkins, back to you. I have read--sitting here reading and apparently physiotherapy in some cases helps people with pulmonary disease because it strengthens the diaphragmatic muscle, and they can breathe better. But we heard in some cases exercise actually exacerbates the underlying symptomatology. How do you as a pulmonologist figure that out, or is that empiric too? Dr. Harkins. Well, you have to have a conversation with your patient, and you have to really understand what their limitations are. There are several studies that show that pulmonary rehab do actually help patients, certain select patients with long COVID, with better outcomes. I think it has to be individualized and multidisciplinary. You have people that help you breathe better. You have people that can help you do a little bit of activity, whether it is resistive or etcetera, depending on what you can do at baseline. You can't just have a one prescription fits all patients---- Senator Cassidy. Yes. So, how do you differentiate, that is my question. Now, how do you come up with the person for whom gentle exercise will gradually strengthen, and gentle exercise will otherwise further exhaust? Dr. Harkins. Well, that is the difficult part, but it is really in trying to get a history from my patient. What can they physically do day to day. Is the--are they getting better? Is this improving over time? Maybe they are a person that could do this pulmonary rehab, but someone that can't get out of bed because of severe post exertional malaise because of something that the day before, that is someone I am not going to send to general pulmonary rehab. Senator Cassidy. We are out of time but let me just say one more thing. Ms. Beale, when she spoke, spoke of wishing to speak directly to her provider and having that kind of therapeutic relationship of being able to look someone in the eyes, not through a zoom screen, but--and I have been there, too. I just thank you all for being those who provide that face to face. With that, I yield. Senator Hickenlooper. Isn't it a spectacular to have doctors in the U.S. Senate who actually know what they are doing and put in the time and the effort to make that observation.  Senator Hickenlooper. I want to have--I just have one more question. When I was young and just learning, a friend talked me into helping him start a community health center in Connecticut back in 1972. We just celebrated 50 years ago. And way back then, the vision of community health centers, and several of you touched on this, really was interconnectivity. And we have come back to that again and again and again, the importance of interconnectivity. Now, we have got to go well beyond networks of community health centers, but into the--into larger, all-inclusive domains. I want to talk a little bit about the research and the interconnectivity. Dr. Walker, the University Colorado, like Emory, has--is one of the nine centers doing this research on long COVID. Were awarded grant funding. How is it--how do you think it is best going to pull all that information together between the nine different, what do you say foci--the focuses, the nine different campuses? Dr. Walker. Yes, we actually had our kickoff meeting yesterday, and it is going on today as well. And so, it was very interesting to hear the approaches everybody is taking. I think what was tasked to us in the grant announcement was a pretty clear delineation of what was needed for long COVID care, and we all agreed with it. So, our approaches are actually quite harmonized. There is a fair amount of unity in how we are going to approach multidisciplinary care, addressing health disparities, how we are going to ensure that we are including the patient voice and community engagement. I think that these meetings will really be able to harmonize that. We want to collect similar information for our programmatic evaluation so that we are able to ensure that we are improving the quality of care in a way, again, that is harmonized so that we can lead policy change on health care for long COVID. Senator Hickenlooper. Right. Anybody else want to add anything to that in terms of how we take these efforts around research that are regional and coalesce them? Dr. Al-Aly. I think this really needs a quarterback. I really--you really cannot play a game and play it well without a quarterback, and this is what we--when we talk about an institute to sort of--can bind or sort of integrate all of this together to really help us move the ball forward, this is what this is about. You know, you can have a lot of things going on, but unless you have really a coordinated approach, you are unlikely to move the ball really fast and really forward. Senator Hickenlooper. Dr. Harkins. Dr. Madlock-Brown. Dr. Madlock-Brown. I would just say there needs to be more sort of I think engagement of the kind of boots on the ground research that you talked about in your initial testimony of the people doing a lot of the work being able to direct the research more. I think better engagement also with patient advocates, many of whom are scientifically trained and so they are bringing both of those knowledge bases. I am thinking of the patient led research collaborative, and I think also maybe having--and then also maybe having some meetings a few times a year where those of us who are working on the different arms are actually getting together and talk. This is the first time I am talking to the other three panelists. I think we need to be more kind of aware of what we are doing and figuring the direction out together. Dr. Harkins. I agree. It has to be bi-directional. We have to learn from our patients, our communities, and also the providers in a variety of research settings and clinical settings. But I think, moving forward, having more open engagement and data transfer, and being very transparent with the public as well as with the researchers, as to what is going on and how can we move forward. Senator Hickenlooper. All right. Well, I think you all demonstrate that--I mean, we are going to get--we are going to make progress on this by taking your individual curiosity and all your coworkers on this and then careful, careful observation. And then figuring out how to take that and assimilate it from different groups. Again, I can't tell you how impressed I am that every one of you are talking about the importance of talking to patients and then just getting more and more and more patient based in terms of determining what the reality is but then also what the next steps should be. So, we are a little over time, so I am going to cut it off here. I would stay here. You know, should take you all out and buy you lunch if they didn't have me going to another meeting. But really appreciate, cannot overemphasize how much I respect your service and your willingness in such a complex, difficult, challenging circumstance where people's lives are on the line. You are on that line. You are out on the front line doing the hard work, so. We get to speak on behalf of the country, I think to a certain extent. On behalf of the United States, we thank you.  Senator Hickenlooper. So that is the end of our hearing today. Again, can't emphasize how much we appreciate the participation of our witnesses. Thank you so much for your taking time and the effort. Any Senators who wish to ask additional questions, will have questions for the record. They will be due in 10 business days, those questions are due February 1st at 5 p.m. Finally, I will ask unanimous consent to enter into the record 37 statements from stakeholder groups outlining their priorities for addressing long COVID. Motion, ah, yes. A claim, I guess we call that.  Senator Hickenlooper. Anyway, this Committee stands adjourned. ADDITIONAL MATERIAL  prepared statement of alexandra yonts Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, Members of the Committee Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony on this important issue. I serve as the Director of the Children's National Pediatric Post COVID Program Clinic, which is one of fewer than a dozen such clinics nationally. Our Clinic operates within a hospital-based setting at Children's National, a tertiary pediatric care center. Our clinic is part of multiple outpatient pediatric networks in the metropolitan area that spans D.C., Maryland, and Virginia, though patients from all over the country have been referred to and seen in our clinic. The Post COVID Program Clinic is a referral-based clinic, accepting referrals from patients, their families, primary care providers, or specialists who have seen the patient. Once a referral has been received, one of our case managers calls the patient or family to perform an intake screening to determine the patient's specific symptoms and needs and confirm eligibility, a call that takes 25-30 minutes on average. The intake assessment is then reviewed by our Post COVID Infectious Diseases (ID) team for eligibility criteria and to determine which specialty providers are needed for each patient. Once the patient is approved, our team works to schedule the patient into one of our clinic slots. Our case managers also continue to work with families to provide any necessary information (e.g., names of specific providers, CPT codes) for acquiring prior authorization to be seen in our clinic or to obtain referrals from primary care. To be eligible for our services, patients must be under 21 years of age, have had a known or suspected COVID-19 infection, and continue to experience persistent symptoms beyond 30 days post-acute COVID-19. We apply the World Health Organization (WHO) consensus definition of pediatric Post COVID-19 Conditions to make our diagnosis. During peak referral time in winter 2022, we had a waitlist of more than 5 months and were strictly observing diagnosis definitions. However, as COVID-19 and Long COVID cases have decreased in the past year, we have evolved into a broader infection-associated chronic illness clinic and have therefore increasingly seen patients with less certain COVID-19 diagnoses. Our multidisciplinary clinic visits last roughly two to two and a half hours and involve multiple 30-minute ``microappointments'' with each specialist, including ID, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Psychology, Hematology, and Gastroenterology. We conduct thorough assessments, including physical exams, cognitive evaluations, functional status assessments, and comprehensive laboratory evaluations. The collaborative visit summary and recommendations are presented by the ID provider, who is the first and last provider to see the patient each visit and acts as the primary coordinator for the patient's team. Notes from the patient visit are sent to the referring and primary care physician. The patients with ongoing, disruptive symptoms, or that require referrals to multiple external subspecialists are recommended for follow-up, either in-person or through telemedicine, with the Post COVID Program ID team, which is scheduled for six to 8 weeks later. It is important to note that during the early years of the clinic's existence we used telemedicine to conduct multidisciplinary visits or as a hybrid with a single offsite provider during an onsite visit. However, the lack of reciprocity or telemedicine waivers among the two states and D.C. in our region and beyond have restricted our ability to provide multidisciplinary telemedicine care and longitudinal follow-up for our patients. Recommendations for Improving Access to Care: 1. Remove barriers to telemedicine: Allow physicians caring for Long COVID patients to have waivers for telemedicine visits across state lines for both initial visits and follow-up visits. It is prohibitively expensive and time consuming to obtain a medical license in every state that does not have a pediatric Long COVID clinic, and it is overly burdensome for patients and their families to travel several hours or days just to be seen in clinic. 2. Ease state regulations for Medicaid patients: Address obstacles faced by patients with Medicaid that are often denied care at Long COVID clinics. 3. Provide incentives for dedicated Long COVID clinics: Offer incentives for hospitals and medical care systems to establish dedicated Long COVID clinics to manage the complexity and time- intensive nature of care for these patients. For example, a Long COVID patient may require a 60-minute visit with a specialist, during which time the specialist would normally be expected to see four non-Long COVID patients. 4. Educate primary care providers: Develop comprehensive educational programs for primary care providers across Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, and medical trainees to increase awareness of Long COVID and guide initial management strategies. This could include screening for PEM and dysautonomia, helping families with initial management strategies (e.g. pacing, energy conservation, autonomic rehabilitation), and coordination of care. 5. Implement care navigators: Introduce Long COVID-specific care navigators to assist patients in managing the health care system, coordinating visits, and accessing records. 6. Create a web-based clinical records repository: Develop a centralized web-based repository for clinical records to facilitate seamless access across multiple health care systems. 7. Address workforce shortages: Address shortages in pediatric physical therapists and mental health professionals, providing training for physical therapists in autonomic rehabilitation and Long COVID-specific therapies, such as patients with post-exertional malaise. Separately, the lack of true treatments for Long COVID, as opposed to the symptomatic management and rehabilitation strategies currently employed by clinicians caring for Long COVID patients, is incredibly frustrating and unacceptable. Accelerated interventional clinical trials for pharmaceutical therapies for Long COVID are desperately needed and inclusion of pediatric subjects in these trials at an early phase should be prioritized and incentivized if possible. In conclusion, the challenges faced by pediatric Long COVID patients underscore the critical need for concerted efforts to improve access to care, enhance awareness, and support health care professionals addressing the complexities of Long COVID management. I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this important discussion and am available as a resource to the Committee. ______
