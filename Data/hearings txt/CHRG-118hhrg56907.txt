THE FEDERAL RESERVE'S SEMIANNUAL MONETARY POLICY REPORT ---------- Wednesday, July 10, 2024 U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Financial Services, Washington, D.C. The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:06 a.m., in room 2128, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Patrick McHenry  presiding. Members present: Representatives McHenry, Lucas, Posey, Luetkemeyer, Huizenga, Wagner, Barr, Williams of Texas, Hill, Loudermilk, Davidson, Rose, Steil, Meuser, Fitzgerald, Garbarino, Kim, Donalds, Flood, Lawler, Nunn, De La Cruz, Houchin; Waters, Velazquez, Sherman, Scott, Green, Cleaver, Himes, Foster, Beatty, Vargas, Gottheimer, Gonzalez, Casten, Pressley, Horsford, Tlaib, Torres, Garcia, Williams of Georgia, Nickel, and Pettersen. Chairman McHenry. The Financial Services Committee will come to order. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a recess of the committee at any time. Today's hearing is entitled, ``The Federal Reserve's Semiannual Monetary Policy Report.'' We like creative titles here, and that is our traditional title for our Humphrey- Hawkins hearing. I will note at the outset that this hearing has a hard stop at 1 p.m., which we will strictly observe, and which seems only humane. I will now recognize myself for 4 minutes for an opening statement. Thank you, Chair Powell, for being back with us today. With prices increasing more than 20 percent since President Biden took office, inflation remains top of mind for American families. In fact, only a quarter of Americans describe current economic conditions as good or excellent, according to the most recent data from Gallup's Economic Confidence Index. Despite President Biden's gaslighting, inflation was not 9 percent when he took office. The out-of-control inflation we are experiencing now is something that this Administration did not inherit but is a product of their policies and their overspending. The nearly $2-trillion partisan and fiscally-reckless spending as a part of the American Rescue Plan poured fuel on a smoldering inflationary fire. After a delayed response to runaway inflation, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has acted with a historic pace of interest rate hikes to ease the pain caused by Democrats' failed economic policies. The Fed is trying to tame these flames, but it is a response not to the actual disease, but to Democrat policies here on Capitol Hill and the Administration. So far this year, inflation has been more persistent than many, including the Fed, previously expected. There is still work to be done to reach the Fed's 2-percent target. As I have repeatedly said, the commitment to independence of the Federal Reserve is of the utmost importance, and it is critical, especially in a political year like this. Chair Powell, just as you did in previous Administrations, you must not allow politics to cloud the Fed's monetary policy. However, despite your best efforts, the Fed independence remains at risk. And, unfortunately, calls are coming from inside the building. Under Vice Chair Barr, the Fed's regulatory and supervisory agenda has become politicized. Most notably, the development of the Basel III Endgame proposal has been a mess. This process has been cloaked in opaque standards and timelines set at meetings of unaccountable global governance bodies. The Fed has promised to process 410 almost universally- negative comments, public comments, regarding the unjustified and underanalyzed initial proposal. Recent press reports, which seem to be the only way Congress gets details on the Basel III Endgame progress, and your comments yesterday, indicate the Fed will finally conduct a long-overdue quantitative impact study. That is welcome. And, if true, this is a promising, promising development. Chair Powell, the last time you testified before this committee, you stated that the initial Basel III Endgame proposal will undergo, ``broad and material changes.'' Yesterday in the Senate, you said the Board supports reissuing the updated proposal for public comment. I am concerned that press reports also claim the Fed will tuck any changes to the proposal into this quantitative impact study. That study, including the substantial changes to the proposal, would then be issued for public feedback with a relatively paltry comment period. I will reiterate to you here what I have said to you in private: Broad and material changes to the Basel III Endgame necessitate a full reproposal. Full stop. Failure to do so will result in an immediate Congressional Review Act vote out of this House of Representatives as quickly as we can possibly process it. Now, it doesn't have to be this way, and I think the Fed adhering to its long-standing principles here is highly important, especially with this interagency process. I will close with this. Your steady and capable apolitical leadership of the Federal Reserve has shepherded our economy through extreme uncertainty. We now find ourselves in the midst of a new type of uncertainty surrounding the leadership of our nation. Doubts, fear, and panic often lead to bad decision- making and even worse policy. I urge you to reject outside political pressure in this volatile time and stay the course for the good of the American people and our economy as a whole. Thank you for your service, and I yield back. I will now recognize the ranking member of the committee, Ms. Waters, for 4 minutes. Ms. Waters. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And welcome back to the Honorable Jerome H. Powell, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Chair Powell, as we saw with the latest jobs report, the labor market remains strong, and the economy is surging. Despite inheriting an economy from the prior Administration that had the worst jobs record since the Great Depression, President Biden has now overseen a record 15.7 million jobs created since he took office, with 206,000 new jobs created just last month. Not only that, but under the Biden Administration, we are witnessing low unemployment rates, rising wages, and stabilizing prices for goods and services. This is not only because of President Biden's strong leadership but also because of the historic legislation signed into law by President Biden, which has resulted in lower costs, created more jobs, rebuilt our infrastructure, supported small businesses, eliminated mostly junk fees, wiped out more than $144 billion in Federal student loan debt for 14 million borrowers, and cut child poverty in half. President Biden is and will continue to advance policies that are providing good-paying jobs and an economy that works for everyone. Now, while I am pleased to see that inflation is declining, the latest data makes it clear that housing remains the number- one driver of core inflation. Since 2020, house prices have increased by nearly 50 percent, with Americans now spending on average over 30 percent of their income on housing. This is a top priority for Democrats but remains an afterthought for Republicans. Earlier this Congress, I reintroduced my comprehensive housing legislation package including the Housing Crisis Response Act, which provides more than $150 billion in fair and affordable housing investments, representing the single-largest investment in affordable housing in our nation's history. These funds would create nearly 1.4 million affordable and accessible homes, bring down housing costs for all, and revive the American Dream of homeownership. Committee Democrats are committed to getting this bill across the finish line, and continue to hold out hope that our Republican colleagues will finally join us in this effort. Unfortunately, extreme MAGA Republicans are not just ignoring housing inflation; they are advancing their Project 2025 manifesto that would dismantle U.S. democracy and the economy as we know it today. Project 2025 is authored by almost two dozen former Trump White House staffers and Trump Administration officials. It was compiled and published by the ultra far-right Heritage Foundation, whose CEO recently declared that they are, ``in the process of a second American Revolution, which will be bloodless if the left allows it to be.'' And, if that kind of talk reminds anyone of the rhetoric we heard in the lead up to and on January 6, 2020, it should. Project 2025 promotes radical ideas to materially undermine the Federal Reserve, if not effectively abolish it. MAGA wants to put you out of a job, Chairman Powell. So, I look forward to your testimony and to hearing from you, a Republican who was first nominated by President Trump, about your thoughts on the importance of the Federal Reserve and the work you have done to help our economy. And I yield back. Chairman McHenry. The gentlelady yields back. I would note for the record that Jerome Powell was initially nominated by President Obama to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System before being nominated by President Trump as Chair. I now recognize the gentleman from Kentucky, Mr. Barr, who is also the Chair of our Financial Institutions Subcommittee, for 1 minute. Mr. Barr. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome, Chairman Powell. Runaway inflation and the increased interest rates necessary to confront it continue to hammer Americans, especially those living paycheck to paycheck. Workers and families feel the pain, making everyday purchases at high prices in the grocery aisle and at the pump. They have suffered years of eroding purchasing power in their paychecks under the Biden Administration's economic management. Heightened mortgage rates make it prohibitive for new homebuyers to reach the American Dream of a starter home for their family. I am pleased that the Fed is resolute in getting inflation under control. And I am pleased that you have committed to an apolitical approach to this. I am not pleased by the Fed's opaque, unjustified, politicized, and underanalyzed regulatory proposals, which will ultimately hurt all Americans. We need to know where the Fed is going on its fundamentally-flawed Basel III Endgame proposal and its opaque regulatory approach. I yield back. Chairman McHenry. The Chair now recognizes the ranking member of our Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy Subcommittee, Mr. Foster, for 1 minute. Mr. Foster. Thank you, Chairman McHenry, and Ranking Member Waters. I would also like to thank you, Chair Powell, for joining us today and for the role you have played in combating inflation and supporting a stable economic recovery. While the Presidency is often the focus of political pronouncements about macroeconomic conditions, there is no question that it undersells the importance and the independence of the work of the Federal Reserve Board. While actions taken by the President and Congress certainly play a significant role, monetary policy decisions made by an independent Federal Reserve are the big dog in shaping macroeconomic conditions that shape economic outcomes for millions of Americans. And work continues on inflation, but significant progress has been made to bring the country in line with the Fed's 2-percent target. The good news is that macroeconomic policy is working as designed. Well-calibrated monetary policy with fiscal support from the American Rescue Plan, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the CHIPS and Science Act has powered strong job creation and low unemployment, while staving off a recession that many thought inevitable--and far better, I should point out, than our peer countries--while Democrats are committed to supporting our efforts to cut costs for American families. I yield back. Chairman McHenry. We will now welcome the testimony of Jerome Powell, the 16th Chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Chair Powell, you will be recognized for 5 minutes to give an oral presentation of your testimony. And without objection, your written statement will be made a part of the record. You are now recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE JEROME H. POWELL, CHAIRMAN, BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (FED) Mr. Powell. Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Waters, and members of the committee, I appreciate the opportunity to present the Federal Reserve's Semiannual Monetary Policy Report. The Federal Reserve remains squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. Over the past 2 years, the economy has made considerable progress toward the Federal Reserve's 2-percent inflation goal. And labor market conditions have cooled, while remaining strong. Reflecting these developments, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are coming into better balance. I will review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy. Recent indicators suggest that the U.S. economy continues to expand at a solid pace. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth appears to have moderated in the first half of this year, following impressive strength in the second half of last year. Private domestic demand remains robust, however, with slower but still solid increases in consumer spending. We have also seen moderate growth in capital spending and a pickup in residential investment so far this year. Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year. In the labor market, a broad set of indicators suggests that conditions have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic, strong but not overheated. The unemployment rate has moved higher but was still at a low level of 4.1 percent in June. Payroll job gains averaged 222,000 jobs per month in the first half of the year. Strong job creation over the past couple of years has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in labor force participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 and a strong pace of immigration. As a result, the jobs-to-workers gap is well down from its peak and now stands just a bit above its 2019 level. Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year. A strong labor market has helped narrow longstanding disparities in employment and earnings across demographic groups. Inflation has eased notably over the past couple of years but remains above the committee's longer-run goal of 2 percent. Total Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in May. Core PCE prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, also increased 2.6 percent. After a lack of progress toward our 2- percent inflation objective in the early part of this year, the most recent monthly readings have shown modest further progress. Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well-anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. In support of these goals, the Committee has maintained the target range for the Federal funds rate at 5\1/ 4\ to 5\1/2\ percent since last July, after having tightened the stance of monetary policy significantly over the previous year and a half. We have also continued to reduce our securities holdings. At our May meeting, we decided to slow the pace of balance sheet runoffs starting in June, consistent with the plans released previously. Our restrictive monetary policy stance is helping to bring demand and supply into better balance and to put downward pressure on inflation. The Committee has stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the Federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. Incoming data for the first quarter of this year did not support such greater confidence. The most recent inflation readings, however, have shown some modest further progress. And more good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. We continue to make decisions meeting by meeting. We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could stall or even reverse the progress that we have seen on inflation. At the same time, in light of the progress made both in lowering inflation and in cooling the labor market over the past 2 years, elevated inflation is not the only risk we face. Reducing policy restraints too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering adjustments to the target range for the Federal funds rate, the Committee will continue its practice of carefully assessing incoming data and their implications for the evolving outlook, the balance of risks, and the appropriate path of monetary policy. Congress has entrusted the Fed with the operational independence that is needed to take a longer-term perspective in the pursuit of our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2-percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well-anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the long run. Our success in delivering on those goals matters to all Americans. I will conclude by emphasizing that we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.  Chairman McHenry. Thank you, Chair Powell. I will now recognize myself for 5 minutes for questions. Chair Powell, let's begin with this question. The Basel III Endgame--I know you had questions about it yesterday, but I think we need further clarity. In your testimony about Vice Chair Barr's discussions with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on the next steps for the Basel III Endgame, you mentioned potential changes have been made to the original Basel III Endgame, that a lot of progress has been made, and that the Board is very close to agreeing on the substance of those changes. But the next steps, that is really what I want to get into. Let's go through the mechanics of what happens next. If the Fed, the OCC, and the FDIC agree on the substance of whatever changes you are going to make, what happens then? Walk us through the mechanics as you anticipate it. Mr. Powell. Okay. We are very close to having exactly that agreement on the substance of the proposed changes pursuant to those talks. The next question is how to proceed. And it is my view and the strong view of a number of Board Members that the appropriate thing to do is to take that new proposal and publish it along with the effects of the quantitative impact survey, and put that out for comment again and receive comments on that, and then take some time to review those comments before finalizing the regulation. And that is a discussion we are having with the other two agencies now. We have not been able to reach agreement on a path to do that, but that is something that we think is the right way to do it. That is what we have done in similar situations. There aren't that many similar situations. But when we see broad and material changes to an important regulation, we think, let's go out again and give all the commenters another chance to comment. Chairman McHenry. Yes. And that also avoids serious lawsuit risk and the risk that will Congress step in and overturn this rulemaking using the Congressional Review Act. I think the other agencies, if they are not agreeing with the Fed, they are running against the independence of the Federal Reserve. This is not a trifling matter of policy. This is a matter of real substance for the independence of the Fed and the rulemaking at the Federal Reserve, and I think we should be able to keep the independence of the Fed separate, especially in this political environment. But opening up a new comment period means you have to get consensus from the Board of Governors on the policy. You have to get the agreement of the scandal-plagued Chair of the FDIC or the five-member board of the FDIC. You have to get agreement by the acting Comptroller of the Currency. These people should not have real standing with the Fed on a matter of serious policy, especially with a Chair of the FDIC who is being ousted by his own party as soon as they can get a replacement confirmed. It is an absurd thing that the Fed has to go to an Acting Comptroller of the Currency, and a guy who is going to be out of a job very soon at the FDIC, and get agreement. But thank you for listening. Is the quantitative impact analysis going to include the interplay with the stress test, the global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge, and all of the other capital charges here? Will that be a part of the quantitative impact analysis? Mr. Powell. It will be in this proposal, which does include changes to the G-SIB surcharge, but does not include the stress test. Chairman McHenry. But the goal here with the quantitative impact is to actually measure the impact of these rules as enacted, based upon existing regulatory structures? Mr. Powell. That is right. Chairman McHenry. Okay. So, let's get into the question of a balance sheet as quickly as we can. Two and a half years ago, you stated that, ``The Committee intends to slow and then stop the decline and size of the balance sheet when reserve balances are somewhat above the level it judges to be consistent with ample reserves.'' That was 2\1/2\ years ago. Where are we in this question of what are ample reserves? Mr. Powell. The balance sheet--the runoff in the portfolio is now, I think, $1.7 trillion so far. So, we have made quite a lot of progress, but we think we have a good ways to go. And as I mentioned, and as you just mentioned, we have now slowed the pace really with a view to getting as far as we can without creating frictions and disruptions that might cause it to prematurely stop shrinking. Going a little bit slower might actually enable us to go further. We think we have quite a ways to go. It's very hard to be precise about it. It is really a question of supply and demand. And we will find that level with a little bit of a buffer on top of it, and that is where we will stop. Chairman McHenry. Okay. Thank you for your testimony. The ranking member, Ms. Waters, is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. Waters. Thank you very much. Chairman Powell, are you familiar with Project 2025? Mr. Powell. Not really, no. Ms. Waters. Have you heard about it? Mr. Powell. I really don't focus on these things at all. Ms. Waters. You don't focus, but you know there is something known as Project 2025? The reason I am asking you is because one proposal is to get rid of the Fed's dual mandate to promote not only stable prices, but also maximum employment. This is your mandate. These are mandates, right? Mr. Powell. Yes. Ms. Waters. This is what you do. Is that right? Mr. Powell. Yes, we do serve a dual mandate. That is right. Ms. Waters. And so, if there was anything that would get rid of the mandate, what would it do to our economy? What would it do to our country? Mr. Powell. The question of which mandate we serve is very much a question for Congress. My own view has been that the dual mandate has served us well. This is something Congress can change and change back to a single mandate. There are, however---- Ms. Waters. What do you do to get maximum employment? Mr. Powell. Basically, we have one tool on the economy, and that is, we raise and lower interest rates. We at the Fed certainly do believe that the dual mandate has been a good thing, and it has enabled us to--it has not stopped us from controlling inflation when that was the thing that needed to be done. Ms. Waters. Of course, I understand you may not have seen, heard, or read about Project 2025. Are you familiar with an effort in the country to get rid of diversity and inclusion? Mr. Powell. I see these things mentioned. But, honestly, we are pretty focused on our task, which is maximum employment and price stability. We are strong supporters of diversity at the Fed, as you know. Ms. Waters. Are you aware that I created a Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion in this committee? Mr. Powell. Yes, I remember that. Ms. Waters. And do you think that getting rid of diversity and inclusion interferes with your ability to really realize the mandate of maximum employment? Mr. Powell. I have spent most of my career in the private sector, and what I observed was that really successful institutions in the United States--companies, organizations-- generally are those that do a really good job on diversity and get the best out of people and attract a broad, diverse range of talents to the table, and people feel comfortable speaking. That is the way we feel about it at the Fed, and that is what we have been doing and will continue to do. Ms. Waters. And do you think it is important not only to have diversity and inclusion in the public sector but in the private sector also? Mr. Powell. Yes. And as I mentioned, if you look at very successful American companies, you will very often see that they are good at that. They are good at hiring, attracting, investing in, and keeping diverse talent. That is one of things that our really good U.S. public companies do well. Ms. Waters. Have you seen improvement during your tenure where diversity and inclusion has created opportunities for more jobs and helped to reduce the unemployment rate? Mr. Powell. I think you see over the course of my long career a big change in diversity and inclusion, and you see that in the private sector and the public sector. And I think that is generally progress. I do. Ms. Waters. Under the work of this committee and the subcommittee, as chaired by Mrs. Beatty, she was able to gather important data about what was going on in the private sector. And what she discovered was that many of the CEOs and others welcomed the opportunity to learn more and to do better and to get assistance. And we saw improvement with diversity and inclusion. Have you seen that? Mr. Powell. There is no question. If you talk to CEOs, they get this. If you want to attract the best talent in our country now, you need to be committed to these things. Ms. Waters. I would like to compliment you on the job that you have been doing. And I would like to compliment you on keeping us informed about inflation. Not only do I welcome you here today, I look forward to working with you for years to come. I yield back. Thank you. Mr. Powell. Thank you. Chairman McHenry. The gentleman from Arkansas, the Vice Chair of the committee, Mr. Hill, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Hill. I thank the Chair. Chair Powell, thanks so much, and welcome back to the committee. I want to pick up where Senator Tim Scott and Chair McHenry left off and reiterate my strong support for your comment yesterday in the Senate about the need to repropose the Basel III Endgame. The Supreme Court's precedent, I think, makes it clear that if a rule undergoes broad and material changes from the proposal to the final rule, the public must be given a meaningful opportunity to review and comment on those changes. You generally share that view, I think. Is that right? Mr. Powell. Yes. Mr. Hill. And I am looking forward to seeing the results of the Quantitative Impact Study and the separate comment period, as well as the interagency agreement that you referenced yesterday. Because of the Dodd-Frank Act's role, and Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Barr's role, and the Fed's role, would it be fair to say the Fed is the first among equals on proposing a rule like this? In other words, does the Fed have a supremacy position on determining whether it should be fully reproposed or not, or do you view it strictly as a collaboration? I'm just curious about your view on that. Mr. Powell. I would say it is strictly collaborative. And I would say that our discussions with the FDIC, which Vice Chair Barr has actually been conducting, and the OCC have been very productive so far. So, I want to make sure to say that. We have continued to work our way through this, and I believe we will get fairly soon to a resolution of the remaining process issue. Mr. Hill. Good. Let me turn from that subject to the court's recent decision to overturn the so-called Chevron Doctrine. Many of us believe this was the first step to reining in decades literally of an unprecedented, uncontrolled growth in the administrative state. And I think all of us, at least on this side of the aisle, are certainly saying to the Federal Reserve and other Federal agencies in our jurisdiction that we want to reassert Article I authority over the direction that independent agencies work. Would it be fair to ask you to certify that because of this change in Chevron, the Fed would commit to promulgating new rules only if they are at the direction of an explicit congressional authorization? Mr. Powell. I think, first of all, we are studying that and several other decisions that have just come down in the last week or two. So, I haven't got anything definitive for you on that. I think you know us to be an organization--I know us to be an organization that is strongly committed to the rule of law. The Supreme Court says what the law is. Mr. Hill. Yes. Mr. Powell. We will always do what we believe the law is. Mr. Hill. I will submit that question maybe in more detail in writing, and maybe you will have a chance to reflect on that. Back in February, you were on, ``60 Minutes,'' and you said the U.S. budget deficit, the national debt is unsustainable. Do you still view that the U.S. is on an unsustainable fiscal path? Mr. Powell. I do. I think I tried to be clear that the level of the U.S. debt is not itself unsustainable, but the path that we are on is unsustainable, and I don't think that is controversial. Mr. Hill. I think many of us certainly agree with that. And we know that when the deficit is at 3 times the economic growth rate and growing, it is of concern. And it has contributed to inflation. Just 3 years ago, in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, you gave a speech where you were confident that inflation was transitory, which I think we have come to realize is not the case. This hearing is sort of a can't-miss opportunity for the Fed to demonstrate some humility on the monetary policy decisions which some on this side of the aisle particularly think have made inflation worse. In your August 2020 Jackson Hole speech, you said the flexible average inflation targeting framework regarding 2 percent--that you would let it run above 2 percent. Was the Fed blinded by the previous 20 years of global change that was deflationary and not--you were not alert enough in 2020 to be more cautious about that change in policy? Mr. Powell. We were certainly mindful of a long period of time in which there had been very low interest rates but also very low inflation, suggesting that the neutral interest rate must have fallen quite substantially. That was the standard view. The thing we didn't see coming was the pandemic. It is not like everything went off the rails. It is like we had this pandemic, and it really changed the way the economy was working. We had a big crisis. We did a lot of things. The concerns that led to us--those concerns that we were in a world of very low interest rates all the time. Mr. Hill. But now, wouldn't you say we are in a very opposite situation where, because of reshoring and tariffs and other---- Mr. Powell. I was going to---- Mr. Hill. ----policies that are---- Mr. Powell. I was going to---- Mr. Hill. ----quite inflationary? Mr. Powell. I would say this. Right now, we have the policy rate in the mid-fives, right? And we see the policy as restrictive. But clearly, the interest rates, the neutral interest rate must have moved up at least in the short term. So, I think that is the question we will be asking ourselves in our review which begins at the end of this year---- Mr. Hill. We look forward to that. Mr. Powell. How much of what---- Mr. Hill. I yield back to the chairman. Mr. Powell. ----we did in that time period is relevant to the new world where rates appear to be higher. Chairman McHenry. The gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Scott, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And welcome, Chair Powell. It is great seeing you. The last time I saw you, we had the gracious pleasure of you visiting with me in my office, and we discussed a great variety of things. Thank you for that visit. Now, Chair Powell, this year the Fed tested 31 banks, up from 23 last year. Is that correct? Mr. Powell. I believe that is right, yes. Mr. Scott. And by estimating losses, revenues, expenses, and capital level under hypothetical stress scenarios, we did that, correct? Mr. Powell. Yes. Mr. Scott. And all 31 banks remained above their minimum common equity Tier 1 capital requirements after observing losses of nearly $685 billion. Is that correct? Mr. Powell. Yes, that is correct. Mr. Scott. Yes, I wanted to get those figures out and provide you with--you may have heard this, but I want to share with the nation, because your Vice Chair Barr made this statement. And I wanted to put in the record his exact quote from this great achievement. He said, ``Our goal of our stress test is to help ensure that we have enough capital to observe losses in a highly stressful scenario, and this test shows that we do.'' I thought that was a great statement of your record. Now, let me ask you my question. It is simple. Will the 2024 Fed stress test results have an impact on how prudential regulators roll out a new and updated capital proposal? Mr. Powell. The two are really two different things. There is the Basel III capital proposal, and there is the stress test. And really the Basel III, as I have mentioned and we have discussed, we are almost ready to put forward for further comment a revised proposal with material and broad changes to it. The stress tests are a different thing. And, of course, we realize we have to adapt those over time and be open to changes. And it has evolved significantly over time, but it is really a separate thing from the Basel III Endgame. Mr. Scott. Give us a little bit more information on the Basel III, because I worked with you with this. Our work goes all the way back to the Obama Administration when we responded to that crisis with our banks and finance. You and I worked that up where we came up with the hardest- hit program to help those who were suffering with, those States that were suffering with high unemployment and at the same time high home foreclosures, and we were successful. And we have established that program, and it is still going on and helping many of our States. But I want to also share what is happening around the world as a result of our activities. The European Union is now set to delay key parts of its bank capital rules by more than a year so that their lenders will not be at a disadvantage. Over in Canada, it is important to note that their banking regulators have also delayed for another year, imposing high capital rules on countries' banks at the risk of making them uncompetitive. And the Swiss National Bank is highly unlikely now to adopt a proposed 15-percent capital requirement for UBS and other Swiss banks. And the Bank of England has issued a near-final proposal to increase U.K. bank capital by 32 percent. I think this is all of a measure of your great work and that of your Vice Chair, and I just wanted to let you have a comment on that, please. Mr. Powell. Sure. We are committed to finalizing this proposal. Our banks are going to live with these rules for a long, long time. The main thing is to get it right, and that is what we are doing. What we do in the end will be consistent with the Basel agreement, and it will also be consistent with what other comparable large jurisdictions are doing. Mr. Scott. You are doing a great job. Keep up the good work. Chairman McHenry. We will now recognize the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Meuser, for 5 minutes. Mr. Meuser. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you very much, Chairman Powell, and also, thank you for continuing to indicate that you will look at the entirety of the economy, the whole economy. I appreciate that. One of the nation's largest banks recently warned in a memo, and it has also been voiced by smaller banks, that the current pace of regulations, such as changes to capital requirements and lowering debit charge interchange caps, could lead to new fees associated with checking accounts and other increased costs for small businesses. This comes amid expiring tax provisions that are sunsetting, as we speak, that are critical for small business, such as the R&D tax credit, interest deductibility, and bonus depreciation. This does raise the question: Are you considering how these regulations and tax increases will directly work against your mandate to achieve 2-percent inflation? Moreover, with the proposed changes to Basel III, it is crucial to ensure that all stakeholders have a voice in this process, which you are stating will occur, and a Basel reproposal and adequate comment period are certainly very welcome. So, Chairman Powell, yesterday in the Senate, you mentioned that the majority view of the Board is to repropose Basel III for comment period. Could you clarify if this means the proposal will be reproposed from scratch, and any other specifics you can provide? Mr. Powell. Sure. We haven't reached agreement on this, as I mentioned. We are working through this with our colleagues at the FDIC and the OCC. And I can't tell you exactly what the form of it will be. The sense of it would be, though, that we are making material changes and that we would want the public to have a chance to look at those changes in light of the way they play off against the quantitative impact survey and they should have a reasonable time to comment on those. In addition, we are focused on one big area. But there are institutions that have made comments all across the spectrum, and we are reading all of those carefully. And we are not going to republish all of those. Mr. Meuser. Okay. Mr. Powell. Some of those we can just make changes and move forward on. It is going to be a very labor-intensive, time- consuming process. Writing these things up takes a long time. And we are going to get it right. Mr. Meuser. Good. That is great. Obviously, you know that Canada recently postponed it, as did the EU and the U.K., and from an international competition standpoint, it seems to make sense, so that is appreciated. Chairman, would you agree that excessive spending, increased taxes, and limits on domestic energy production are causes of higher costs for business, contribute to inflation, and tighten the labor markets, kind of running contrary to your two mandates? Mr. Powell. You are asking me kind of a political question there. I am not going to--I don't want to criticize a platform of economic fiscal policies that are not really ours to decide. Mr. Meuser. It is really more of an economic question, but I appreciate your answer, sir. So, when you mentioned recalibrating policy yesterday in the Senate hearing, was part of your thinking taking a more holistic view of economic conditions? Mr. Powell. Yes, very much so. Mr. Meuser. Okay. Mr. Powell. Yes. Mr. Meuser. Chairman Powell, is there any data to support so-called, ``greedflation''--that somehow, it has caused inflation? Is there any data to support those comments? Mr. Powell. We look at it that this inflation has been caused by a combination of very strong demand and constrained supply. So, it was really a high-speed collision between an economy that was reopening. And, by the way, there was inflation all over the world at the same time. So, these were some common factors. But at the same time, you had tremendous demand, for example, for automobiles. You had constrained supply because there weren't enough semiconductors, long story short. Mr. Meuser. Right. Mr. Powell. But to us, that is what this inflation is all about. We have observed the sort of healing of the supply side, at the same time restrictive monetary policies are weighing on demand, and we have seen inflation coming down from the---- Mr. Meuser. Okay. So, there is no data that supports that gouging of consumers is part of the inflation? Mr. Powell. It has been very hard to track a connection with earnings and things. Mr. Meuser. Secretary Yellen mentioned that she didn't feel that there was grocery price shock and that sort of thing. Groceries and gasoline are the two driving problems for American families, and certainly my constituents. Do you believe your policies are helping to alleviate in those two areas? Mr. Powell. A lot of things affect--let's take energy first. The energy prices are generally set at the global level. We do have some effect on that. Mr. Meuser. Sorry, Chairman Powell. I have run out of time. Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Chairman McHenry. The gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Cleaver, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Cleaver. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Chairman Powell, for being here. And, in some ways, I want to follow up or at least respond to the very civil question of why we need an independent central bank. Your response was, ``The question you raised, if I answered it, it would be along some kind of a political avenue,'' and you didn't want to drive on that avenue. So, I am also very much concerned about a lot of the discussion. I have been on this committee for a while, and it comes up quite often. When the Federal Reserve was birthed around the turn of the century, I think, 1913, 1918, something like that, prior to the establishment of a central bank, was our country experiencing a lot of recessions because people felt no security, particularly the business community, in making big investments because nobody was in control, this kind of thing? What went on just went on. Mr. Powell. Yes, I think the lack of a central bank between 1836 and the founding of the Fed was a period of lots and lots of depressions. And a lot of it had to do with the crop cycle and the banks not being able to handle the very large seasonal swings, and there was no central bank to provide liquidity. And that is really what gave rise to the founding of the Fed in the early part of the last century. Mr. Cleaver. Do you think that it is dangerous to blend monetary policy and fiscal policy? Mr. Powell. To blend them? Mr. Cleaver. Yes. Mr. Powell. We try to keep them very separate. And we try not to express views on fiscal policy. That is for elected people who have undergone elections and won and make those very difficult decisions. We have a really specific narrow-but- important mandate that we do, that you have given us. And we try to stick to that. So, we take your policies as given, and then we conduct monetary policy with that. Mr. Cleaver. I don't want to draw you into any kind of a political response, and I have not read all of this Project 2025 document, but I read some of it online a couple of nights ago. And whether it comes out of a 2025 or a 3089, whatever, one of the things that I am concerned about from reading this document is that the document argues that the Federal Reserve is the inflation problem and eliminating the Federal Reserve, imposing economic policy on the Fed, that does not come from within the Fed. So I am wondering, would you agree with any of that I just stated, whether it came from me or Chairman McHenry or anybody else? Mr. Powell. I will just say, first of all, we are certainly fair game for any criticism people have. I think we have--what we have learned and what we know is that having an independent central bank is really essential. If you want to have high and volatile inflation, then the quickest road to that would be to undermine the independence of the central bank, of the Fed in our case. I find that view is very widely held up here on Capitol Hill, in both political parties. Mr. Cleaver. So, eliminating the Federal Reserve is best for promoting economic stability? Mr. Powell. Yes. Mr. Cleaver. Thank you. I knew that the ranking member was going to come and deal with the issue of housing. She always does. And we all appreciate the fact that she is obsessed with it, and I like that obsession. But I am wondering, as we try to figure out how to deal with this issue--oh my goodness. My time has run out. Mr. Powell. Is that a question? Mr. Cleaver. I didn't finish it, but I--yes, if you knew where I was going, please. Chairman McHenry. The gentleman's time has expired. We will now recognize the gentleman from New York, Mr. Garbarino, for 5 minutes. Mr. Garbarino. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chair Powell, thank you very much for being here today. Based on some comments made today and yesterday, it appears you have made quite a bit of progress on changes to the Basel III Endgame proposal, and you are very close to agreeing on some of the substance of those changes. I know you won't get into specifics. You said that. I just don't know how deep you won't get into them. But I just want to confirm what you said to my colleague, Mr. Meuser. There will be--you are not reproposing some things; it is just going to be a partial reproposal? Mr. Powell. What we are looking at doing are major things that we have been working on, and there will be additional changes that will be made, that won't be reproposed. That is what we are working on, rather than a full, wide proposal. Mr. Garbarino. So, it is not a complete reproposal, just a partial one? Mr. Powell. Yes. Mr. Garbarino. Can you tell me which components you are---- Mr. Powell. Until it is all agreed upon and ready to go and vetted, I am reluctant to try to get into too many specifics, just because when you are doing these things, nothing is agreed upon until everything is agreed upon. Mr. Garbarino. No, I understand. I am not asking for what specifically your changes---- Mr. Powell. I hope to be able to come to you with a really clear answer on that soon. Mr. Garbarino. I understand. Mr. Powell. We are ready to go at the Fed. Mr. Garbarino. And that is my next question. It has been said several times that you and many of the Members of your Board are at odds with your counterparts at the FDIC and the OCC over how to proceed with putting out a revised proposal for comment. So, if the FDIC and the OCC are not yet on board with allowing for a new comment period, who is holding up this consensus? Is it Chair Gruenberg? Mr. Powell. I don't want to say that we are at odds. I just want to say we are working through this issue together and---- Mr. Garbarino. Someone has to be holding it up. Mr. Powell. It is a discussion that we are having. And I think it has been constructive, and I think we will try to keep it that way. Mr. Garbarino. Can you at least answer whether or not the five-member FDIC Board needs to sign off, or can you just go to the Chair? Mr. Powell. No, I think it is the Board. And, of course, the Comptroller is one person. The FDIC can speak for themselves, but I do think their Board would be the question. Mr. Garbarino. Okay. One final timeline question before I move on. You mentioned yesterday that a reasonable prediction would be that Basel would not be finalized until the first quarter of 2025. Under this timeline, would it be safe to say that implementation would then not occur until at least the beginning of 2026? Mr. Powell. Again, I can't that be specific. Someone asked me, Does it sound like the first quarter of next year might be? And I said it might. There is a range of times it would take. The thing is, as I mentioned, U.S. banks are going to be living with these rules for many years. The point is to get it right, not to do it quickly. We want to---- Mr. Garbarino. I agree. Mr. Powell. ----do it right, listen to the comments, make sound decisions, and move ahead in a way that gives us a sustainable set of rules so that we won't have to come back and fix all the mistakes. Mr. Garbarino. Thank you. I want to move on to another topic, long-term debt. You mentioned yesterday that you would most likely not move forward with other rules until people reach a place of understanding and acceptance of a revised Basel proposal. I hope that is the truth, as banks need to fully understand the implications of a Basel proposal before any action is taken on long-term debt. Finally, Chair Powell, I would like to emphasize the need for the Fed to conduct a comprehensive, data-driven, and, most importantly, transparent assessment of the current liquidity framework. Very quickly, will you commit to conducting a public Quantitative Impact Study and a full notice-and-comment rulemaking before imposing any new liquidity requirements? Mr. Powell. I didn't catch the first part of your question. Mr. Garbarino. Will you commit to conducting a public Quantitative Impact Study and a full notice-and-comment rulemaking before imposing any new liquidity? Mr. Powell. On the liquidity thing, I am not exactly sure what we are contemplating there. We certainly contemplate getting a full range of input from the public on that because some of these are novel ideas and we understand that. Mr. Garbarino. Okay. As the chairman said before, these impact studies are very important because they show what impacts these rules would have. I think it is very important that we have that, because we had a mucked-up process with Basel 2.0 and we don't want to repeat that. I have a little time yet, so I am going to yield to my colleague from Pennsylvania, Mr. Meuser, because I know he had another question. Mr. Meuser. I thank my colleague. Chair Powell, just back to what we were talking about, the price instability of groceries and gasoline where we do have somewhat of an affordability crisis, as it has been termed, so would lowering rates in near future be a pro-growth initiative? Is that something that is being considered, that would actually drive investments and give a clearer picture for investments and perhaps help in these two categories, and in the end increase in supply, as we lower those prices? Mr. Powell. Honestly, when we think about our near-term rate moves, we are thinking about a couple of things, the first of which is we want to be more confident about inflation. Mr. Meuser. My apologies, Mr. Chairman. I went over. Mr. Powell. Sorry. Mr. Meuser. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman McHenry. The gentleman from California, Mr. Vargas, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Vargas. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much for this hearing. And to the ranking member, thank you very much. Chairman Powell, thank you very much for being here. We appreciate it. In fact, I was looking at your history when they were saying who nominated you, when you got here, and all that. In fact, you had had public service even prior to that time, right? Mr. Powell. That is right. Mr. Vargas. I thank you for your long public service to the nation. Mr. Powell. Thank you. Mr. Vargas. I think it is outstanding. Mr. Powell. I appreciate it. Mr. Vargas. I think we all respect you deeply here. You are pretty boring here today, to be frank. Mr. Powell. Sorry? Mr. Vargas. You are pretty boring here, to be frank. Mr. Powell. Thank you. That is a high compliment. Mr. Vargas. Yes, it is, because sometimes when you are here, there are all sorts of cameras here, and they are watching your every step and all. And I think there is a reason for that, right? And that is because the economy is doing okay. Am I wrong about that? Mr. Powell. Take a look at our economy. We are growing at around 2 percent, it feels like. Inflation is down to 2.5, 2.6 percent. Unemployment is at 4.1 percent. These are good numbers. Mr. Vargas. I hear the parade of horribles on the other side, how the sky is falling. But I don't see the media here to attest to that. In fact, it is just the opposite. Did you read some of the headlines of the new government in Britain? If not, let me read one. It says, ``New British government inherits worst economic plight since World War II.'' In fact, there are a number of headlines like that, saying that England is in trouble. I imagine, if you were running their central bank, I bet you there would be a whole bunch of media here, beating you up to find out what the hell you are doing or what you aren't doing. And I think the reason for that, again, is I think the government here has done a pretty darn good job. One of the things you said you didn't see coming was the pandemic, right? And I am not putting words in your mouth. Mr. Powell. Right. Mr. Vargas. In fact, I was here. And I heard the parade of horribles that we were going to have a recession, maybe a depression. In fact, the country was going to fall apart. Did it? Mr. Powell. No, we went through a period of high inflation, as the other countries did. And that is very challenging for the people. Mr. Vargas. And in fact, isn't it the case that most of those countries had higher inflation than we did, for example, in Europe? Mr. Powell. Over time, there were times when their inflation was higher, I think. Mr. Powell. Yes, it was. Mr. Powell. Overall, it was broadly comparable. Mr. Vargas. Yes, in fact, I brought it up a number of times here because there was a whole bunch of those countries that had much higher inflation than we did. Mr. Powell. Europe was much harder hit with the energy issues coming out of the Ukraine war than we were. Mr. Vargas. Sure. There is a whole bunch of other issues to instability; they had political instability and a whole bunch of things, obviously. But it is interesting today that the parade of horribles that we hear doesn't seem to manifest itself with the media or the attention that you normally get. And that is good. I think it is a great thing. Now, I do want to ask a couple of questions. I do have concerns. Basel III on housing, I think I have made those concerns known to your office, and I won't rehash them. But I do have issues that I want to talk to you about with regard to climate. Obviously, you said you don't read too much in the news. You didn't hear about Project 2025. I don't think that is what you meant to say, and I don't want to put words in your mouth. When the ranking member asked you if you had heard about it, I think you said, no. I think you have probably heard about it, but you haven't read it. Mr. Powell. I have seen nothing more than headlines on it. I have devoted zero---- Mr. Vargas. Me, too. Mr. Powell. ----energy into that. Mr. Vargas. Yes, I don't read that wacky stuff myself either, but I certainly read the headlines. But the reason I ask about headlines is you obviously have seen what has happened in Texas. You have seen what has happened with climate change. In fact, you have testified, I think, before that you believe in climate change. Is that correct? Mr. Powell. Sure. Mr. Vargas. Yes. And what are we doing? You have taken a number of steps, I think, that have been very positive to make sure that we look at the risks of climate change. Could you go over some of those? Because that does concern me. I think that is a change that we also didn't see--well, we saw it coming. I saw it coming. I have been saying it for a long time, but a lot of people didn't believe me. Mr. Powell. If you are looking at financial regulators, you are looking at people who have a very, very limited role in climate. And that is just to look at the institutions that we supervise and make sure that they understand and can manage the risks that they are running. We are not the climate policymakers. Mr. Vargas. Right, right. And I am not asking that. Mr. Powell. It has to be elected people to do that. Mr. Vargas. Right. But you have to take a look at the risk. Look at the risks that the insurance companies are taking. And the banks, of course, are financing these homes, and now, you can't get insurance on them. So, all of a sudden, you can't rebuild. These are risks that the banks are looking at. Mr. Powell. We don't regulate insurance companies. Mr. Vargas. No, but you regulate the banks. Mr. Powell. Banks, yes. Mr. Vargas. And these banks have mortgages on those houses, do they not, many of them? Mr. Powell. In many cases, they are not writing mortgages anymore. So, that is the result we are getting, that banks are saying they see these risks. They do. Mr. Vargas. My time is up. But thank you again. I appreciate you. Mr. Powell. Thank you. Chairman McHenry. The gentlelady from California, Mrs. Kim, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. Kim. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Powell, thank you for being with us today. Gosh, you are under a lot of pressure from all sides to divert from our monetary policy goals. And I commend you for your leadership and for staying focused on the core missions of the Fed, which are price stability and maximum employment. And thanks again for your leadership. You have stated that it is the Fed's strong view that you will have to reopen the Basel III Endgame proposal for comment again, and I really urge the FDIC and the OCC to move forward with reopening the comment period. Chairman Powell, would broad support mean abandonment of any modified proposal that garners mostly negative public comments in a public comment period for the modified proposal? Mr. Powell. Sorry. I didn't follow your question. Mrs. Kim. Would broad support mean abandonment of any modified proposal that garners mostly negative public comments in a public comment period for the modified proposal? Mr. Powell. Broad support empirically would mean a good solid vote on the Fed Board, and I have tried not to be specific about what that means. And it also means broad support among the broader community of commenters on all sides. That is what I meant by broad support. Mrs. Kim. Got it. Mr. Powell. Yes, that is what I meant by it. Mrs. Kim. Thank you. And as the Fed looks to enacting several changes to the proposal, I would also urge you not to overlook how the Basel Endgame proposal would disproportionately impact FBOs and regional banks and U.S. domestic jobs because of the way the outside operational risk is weighted. Can we get your commitment to that? Mr. Powell. Let me just say we are--I am not going to get into specifics. We are well aware of those concerns. We have, obviously, carefully digested all of the comments we have gotten from all different sectors, and those are concerns of which we are well aware. Mrs. Kim. Thank you. Let's switch gears to another matter. You have spoken on the need of transparency. Are there any conversations at the Fed to have more transparency and better engagement and consistency with stress tests? Mr. Powell. We have increased transparency in the stress test over time. And I would say we do--if people want to write articles and make comments that are critical of the stress tests, we are going to read those, and we are going to think about that. We are open to improving it. We know that the stress test has to evolve over time if it is to remain relevant, and I think transparency is one of those subjects where we are prepared to listen and think about ideas. Mrs. Kim. Definitely. I would like to see a stress test regime that is more transparent and adaptive, identifying unforeseen risks, so we can achieve that by being more collaborative, I believe, yes. I am also interested to hear from you whether you and your fellow banking regulators have considered the cumulative impact of any new liquidity standards with the Basel III framework and the existing post-crisis liquidity requirement. What industry engagement has the Board's staff held with respect to changes to the liquidity framework? Mr. Powell. We haven't actually made any proposals on that yet. We have had significant industry interaction on the proposals. And we will move, I think some time this year, toward---- Mrs. Kim. What about the Board staff? Have they conducted any industry-wide data collection to study the necessity for and the impact of any changes to the existing liquidity framework? Mr. Powell. I think we have done a lot of investigation on that front, but I think that this is the beginning of the process, not the end. We haven't published proposals yet. We are working on them. And it is a pretty early stage. Mrs. Kim. Thank you. Let me quickly talk about the inflation issue. We had a peak inflation rate of 9.1 percent in June 2022, and a lot has been talked about it being a supply side issue and the demand shock from the opening economy. Can you elaborate on how the expansion in the money supply and fiscal stimulus played a role in persistent inflation? And why is it so important to get to the 2-percent inflation rate goal right now? Mr. Powell. The inflation that arose here was a collision between very strong demand as the economy reopened. Remember, there had been fiscal transfers. We had very low rates. Those things were done because we thought we could be looking at a very, very bad economic time. As it turns out, the economy reopened and demand spiked very high. People had saved a lot of money because they couldn't spend. And so, there was tremendous demand and there was constrained supply. And what you got was inflation, and you got that everywhere in the world. That is what happened. We have made quite a lot of progress on inflation. To bring inflation down, the Fed has been working, with restrictive policy, on cooling demand. That has been working. And the supply side has been healing, and the negative labor participation shock has essentially reversed, adjusted for---- Chairman McHenry. The gentlelady's time---- Mr. Powell. So, it is kind of working out as we had expected. Chairman McHenry. The gentlelady's time has expired. Mrs. Kim. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Chairman McHenry. The gentlelady from Georgia, Ms. Williams, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. Williams of Georgia. Thank you, Chairman McHenry. And thank you, Chair Powell, for joining us today. As the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Raphael Bostic, has so rightly pointed out, combating economic inequality is a critical part of the Fed's dual mandate. When everyone in our community doesn't have the opportunity to contribute to their fullest potential, the economy is not firing on all cylinders. Nowhere is this more apparent than in my home City of Atlanta, which has more Black-owned businesses than any other city in the country but is still among our nation's leaders in the racial wealth gap. I applaud you and your staff at the Federal Reserve for the work that you are doing to make sure that the economy works as well for the hardworking people of Georgia's, ``Fighting Fifth District,'' as it does for those in the top 1 percent. This includes helping to make sure that financial services are affordable and accessible to everyone. As the Fed moves forward with the proposed changes to Regulation II, I know that protecting access to affordable and accessible banking is at the top of your mind. That is why I was concerned when I started receiving outreach about the unintentional effects that the Reg II proposed rule would have on marginalized communities, including my constituents in Atlanta. Specifically, I heard about the impact that the reduction in interchange fees proposed by this rule could have on Bank On certified accounts in my district and across the country. The Bank On initiative is a partnership between financial institutions and trusted community-based organizations to offer low- or no-cost bank accounts to unbanked and underbanked individuals. Access and affordability are at the heart of the changes that you are proposing, and I couldn't agree more with those goals. But we have to make sure that programs designed to serve unbanked and underbanked individuals and marginalized communities continue to flourish. In response to these concerns, my colleague across the aisle, Mr. Luetkemeyer, and I sent a bipartisan comment letter in March to you highlighting those very concerns and urging that the final rule not negatively impact low- and moderate- income communities. Chair Powell, how does the Fed take into account how regulations impact constituents who don't have an attorney or an interest group to submit a comment on their behalf? Mr. Powell. Let me say first, we have heard those concerns that you raise and others have raised about aspects of the proposed rule, and we very much understand the concerns that are being raised. Where we don't have comment letters, we try to be thoughtful about the impact of our regulations, but principally, we are looking for public comment on things. Ms. Williams of Georgia. Thank you. The FDIC's most recent data shows that the rate of unbanked households is at an all-time low. The Bank On initiative has certainly played an important role in this progress. Bank On certified accounts are available to more than 95 percent of low- and moderate-income households across all 50 States. Access to low- or no-cost banking services is a door to financial inclusion and wealth generation for marginalized families. As written, Reg II could undo some of the enormous progress made in the past several years. Chair Powell, how can regulators work with members of this committee to ensure that future proposed rules do not hinder Americans' access to tools that enhance the Federal Reserve's financial inclusion efforts? Mr. Powell. We are very focused on things like Bank On, as you pointed out, and on access to the financial system for marginalized communities. So, we wouldn't want to do anything to weigh on that. And we are happy to work with you and your office on those issues. As I mentioned, we are hearing the comments and we are reading them and we are taking them into account as we think about appropriate changes to the proposal. Ms. Williams of Georgia. We will definitely follow up on that because as we are writing these regulations, I want to make sure that we are thinking about the real-world impact and what it means to consumers when they are accessing financial institutions. I look forward to working with you to further the Fed's financial inclusion efforts. Earlier this week, I sent you another bipartisan letter related to the Federal Reserve's April proposal to extend the operating hours of the Fedwire Funds Service to 22 hours per day, 7 days per week, and every day of the year. That was news that I was eager to hear. This may sound like a small technical change, but it can have a big impact on our constituents, especially for those living in marginalized communities who live paycheck to paycheck. Growing up in the booming metropolis of Smiths Station, Alabama--you have probably never heard of it, Chair Powell--but there were limited options for loans and short-term loans. In an area where everyone needs a car to get to work and they have to work to eat, when money is short, any delay in accessing a paycheck or paying a bill can disrupt your entire household. Extending operating hours for the Fedwire Funds Service and the National Settlement Service will allow people continual access to their funds outside of what we deem normal operating hours. And I hear the gavel. I am out of time. But I will be following up for more conversation. Thank you. Mr. Powell. Thank you. Chairman McHenry. The gentleman from Nebraska, Mr. Flood, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Flood. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Powell, after a year with very high inflation that battered American paychecks, inflation rates have moderated somewhat, however, inflation continues to linger above the 2- percent target rate set by the Federal Reserve. In fact, the PCE inflation index has remained above 2 percent for the last 3 years. The Federal Open Market Committee's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy issued at the beginning of the year stated that, ``The Committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, and therefore judges that, following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.'' Chairman Powell, does the commitment to achieve a 2-percent average over time apply in the other direction as well? Meaning, that if inflation remains above 2 percent for a protracted period, would the committee instead aim for inflation moderately below 2 percent for some time in order to achieve an inflation average of 2 percent? Mr. Powell. No, it doesn't. Mr. Flood. Is it fair to say that you would need to see the PCE index dip below 2 percent at least once in the coming months in order to contemplate a rate cut? Mr. Powell. No, that is not fair to say. We have said that you don't want to wait until inflation gets all the way down to 2 percent because inflation has a certain momentum. You wouldn't wait that long. If you waited that long, you have probably waited too long, because inflation will be moving downward and will go well below 2 percent, which we don't want. Mr. Flood. What combination of factors would you need to see in order to support a rate cut this month or in September? Mr. Powell. Once again, I will say I am not sending any signals on any particular date of any meeting whatsoever on policy. I said that yesterday, and I am saying it again today. But I will answer your question. What we said is that we want to be more confident, we want to have greater confidence, and that means more good inflation readings that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent, greater confidence that that is the case. Remember, we have a dual mandate, too. We are not just an inflation-targeting central bank. We also have an employment mandate. So, I could also see us cutting--and we have said this--if we saw unexpected weakening in the labor market. And we do now see--I will speak for myself--I now see the risks to the two mandates as much closer to being in balance. I think for a long time, we have had to focus heavily on the inflation mandate, but I think now we are getting to the place where the labor market is getting pretty much in balance to where it needs to be. And so, we are looking at both sides. Mr. Flood. I know that the media and others have continued to talk about the prospect of political interference with the Federal Reserve. With an election coming up, I know you are very aware of the heightened scrutiny awaiting the Federal Open Market Committee meetings in July and September. Can you use this opportunity to speak regarding the Federal Reserve's political independence going into this election? Mr. Powell. Sure. I would be glad to. Our political independence is critical to our ability to do our jobs and to sustain the faith of people across the political spectrum. And it comes down to, we make our decisions based on economic data, the evolving outlook, and balance of risks, and we don't take into consideration any other factors, including political factors. We have a long history of doing that, and I think the public believes we will do that. Any decision that we make on rates, on any of our policy tools, it is going to be very well- grounded in the data, and it will represent our best thinking about what is best for the American public in the near- and medium-term. And that is the promise that I will give and that all my colleagues will give. And that means that we are not looking at things like election cycles. We are not looking at any of those things. We are looking at the data, what does it tell us is the right thing to do. When we figure that out, when we think it is time to move, we will go ahead and move, but not until then. Mr. Flood. I appreciate that. Finally, I would like to raise concerns with housing costs. While shelter is one component of the broader PCE calculation, housing often makes up one of the largest, if not the largest expense for many consumers. Inflation for housing remains persistently high. One of the characteristics of this economy is that consumer sentiment is remarkably low. Do you think high housing costs could be contributing to the persistently-low consumer sentiment? Mr. Powell. I think high prices generally--I don't think anybody really can be super highly confident of their answer on this. But I do think it is a fact that while inflation has come down, prices are high. And people are paying more for things, more for housing, more for the essentials of life such as food and energy. And that is how I would explain surveys. We say that the economy is growing, inflation has come down, unemployment is low, and all of that is true, but prices are high. Mr. Flood. Thank you, Chairman Powell, for your answer and your testimony. And I yield back. Chairman McHenry. The gentleman from New York, Mr. Torres, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Torres. Thank you. Chair Powell, the Fed has an inflation rate target of 2 percent. Are you waiting for both PCE inflation and CPI inflation to fall to 2 percent or only one of those metrics? Mr. Powell. We look at different measures, but for a quarter of a century, the PCE inflation has been the Fed's goal. We have defined our goal in terms of that because we think it is the better measure of the costs and inflation that the public actually faces. Mr. Torres. And now, you have said that you are willing to cut interest rates before reaching the 2-percent target. Is the decision to cut interest rates going to be driven by reaching a particular target en route to 2 percent, or is it driven by the overall trajectory of the inflation rate? Mr. Powell. It is going to be driven by the totality of the data. There isn't a particular number that we have in mind that we have to get to. It is more, you look at all of the data, and the question we are asking ourselves is, are we sufficiently confident that inflation really is moving down toward 2 percent? So, what is the underlying inflation rate looking through the volatility? We are also looking, as I mentioned, at the labor market, and we are asking ourselves--we have to take into account now maximum employment, that mandate. We are looking at both of those in the decisions that we make. Mr. Torres. Are you confident that the inflation rate is on a downward trajectory? Mr. Powell. I do have some confidence of that. I think we have seen that over the past several years. The question is, are we sufficiently confident that it is moving sustainably down to 2 percent? And I am not prepared to say that yet. Mr. Torres. Chair Powell, you announced a reproposal of Basel III rather than a mere revision. Do you believe that the U.S. banking system is sufficiently capitalized in the absence of Basel III? Mr. Powell. I have long been of the view that U.S. banks are well-capitalized and that the level of capital in the U.S. banking system is about right. Mr. Torres. Okay. So if the banking system is sufficiently capitalized in the absence of Basel III, then what exactly is the need for Basel III? Mr. Powell. First of all, there is no precise answer as to the appropriate level of capital. I think we have been part of developing the Basel standards. They create international broad parity. It is important that we have that parity. And it is important that we do something that is comparable to what the other large jurisdictions are doing, and it is consistent with Basel. And I think that is what our banks want, that is what we want, and that will best serve the public. Mr. Torres. But you agree we should conform without gold- plating? Mr. Powell. Some things we have gold-plated and some things we haven't, but I think our Endgame proposal should be, at the end, consistent with the requirements of Basel and consistent with what the other large jurisdictions are doing. Mr. Torres. Are you confident that there is no legal conflict between the standardization recommended by Basel III and the regulatory tailoring mandated by Congress? Mr. Powell. I think we can work through all of that. Mr. Torres. Okay. But if there were a conflict---- Mr. Powell. Basel doesn't impose any requirements on anyone. There are no enforceable requirements. Every jurisdiction does what it is going to do. Basel doesn't bind anybody. Mr. Torres. Right, but the regulatory framework you are adopting would codify those recommendations. Mr. Powell. Yes. Mr. Torres. It could have the force of law, right? Mr. Powell. Yes, that is right. Mr. Torres. So, if there were a conflict between the codified recommendations and an Act of Congress, would you agree that an Act of Congress would supersede those recommendations? Mr. Powell. Yes. Sure. Mr. Torres. Does the loss of Chevron deference have any implications for Basel III? Mr. Powell. It is very early days to assess. There are several decisions that are about administrative law, and I think it is too early for us to say. Mr. Torres. Fair enough. Mr. Powell. Ultimately, the question is, are the actions we are taking in compliance with the law? And that decision says that there will be less deference or no deference maybe to the opinions of the agency, but that just means a court will be making--they are answering the same question, which is, are those actions consistent with the law? Mr. Torres. The Fed has a target rate when it comes to inflation. Does the Fed have a target when it comes to quantitative tightening, like when it comes to what should be the size of the Fed's balance sheet? Mr. Powell. We don't have a specific target, no. Mr. Torres. What would you consider to be a healthy size for the Fed's balance sheet? Mr. Powell. We define it not with numbers but with words. We want an ample reserves regime with a buffer so that reserves are not scarce. And we think plentiful reserves, ample reserves is the right place to be, and we will find that empirically. Mr. Torres. Can you put a number on that? Mr. Powell. No, I really can't. Mr. Torres. For 4 decades, we have had the best of both worlds, low unemployment and low inflation. Can the U.S. economy return to the golden age of low unemployment and low inflation, or are we doomed to live with a new normal of higher interest rates? Mr. Powell. I think we have low inflation. We have had a period here of very low--I'm sorry, of low unemployment. Mr. Torres. We have high inflation. Mr. Powell. We do. Mr. Torres. So, can we have the best of both worlds? Mr. Powell. We certainly can, and that is the plan. Mr. Torres. Okay. Mr. Powell. We are going to return to 2-percent inflation, I am reasonably confident. Some people argue that we are entering into a world of a lot of upward inflation shocks. That would be a challenging world. But that remains to be seen. Mr. Torres. Thank you. Chairman McHenry. The gentleman from Iowa, Mr. Nunn, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Nunn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Chairman Powell, for being with us today. Your office has done a very diligent job in working with this body on both sides of the aisle. I chalk some of that up to the fact that you have some very good folks from Iowa on your staff there helping to keep the trains running on time. So, that is excellent. I will note that in Iowa, the average family has experienced annual inflation of about $925-per-month just in the last 3 years. I have six kids. We are the number-one egg- producing State in the country. But yet, eggs for each one of my kids went up 40 percent this past year, and multiply that by six. I am no economist, but that adds up really quick. And I think I am reflective of a lot of families across the country right now. Mr. Chairman, one of the things I would like to talk about is what we are focused on and what your department is working on at the Fed. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in my opinion, should be more focused on folks like those in my hometown of Bondurant, Iowa, versus what is coming out of unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, Belgium, for example, which is one of the reasons I am so grateful that you have talked about reopening Basel III for a conversation on what is in the best interest of the American people. I applaud you and your team for this. While I would like to see Basel III, candidly, scrapped altogether, I think that there are three things in this proposal that we have to look at immediately. One, the impact of credit availability, especially to ensure that it won't be tighter credit conditions on small businesses back home in places like Iowa. Two, the ability for farmers across the country to be able to hedge their grain, corn, soybeans, and livestock in a new Basel III conversation. And ultimately, eliminate the downstream effect on American banks being held to higher standards, very clear in Basel III, than what is being held in Europe. With that, I want to re-address your team's attention to the letter I sent in a bipartisan way with Senator Jerry Moran, specifically emphasizing the negative impact of increased bank capital requirements on the economy, our constituents, and ultimately, our agricultural producers across the country. First, can you confirm that the next Basel III proposal as outlined will address concerns from our agricultural growers, including our farmers? Mr. Powell. Let me just say that we are well aware of the concerns you are raising about hedging, and I am not going to be too specific about things, but we are quite aware of those concerns. Mr. Nunn. I certainly hope your team gets the opportunity to hear that because it is one of the most painful things I am hearing back in my home district. Would you agree that the end users' concerns could have been mitigated maybe at the front end of this if Congress or, say, a farmer in my district had been included in those opening conversations? Mr. Powell. In hindsight, perhaps that is right. But in any case, that is the purpose of the comment period. Mr. Nunn. I will note that 84 percent of the comments coming from this proposal concern entities outside of banks, as you know. A lot of those were from the agricultural industry who felt that they had no voice in this and were a recipient of things that really harmed their businesses. With that, I want to read quickly--former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers was asked about Basel, and he said, ``We are going to need to prepare for consolidation in banking in the future, and quite possibly, some even further evolution of lending away from banks.'' Now, I am going to note here that Iowa has over 250 community banks with assets under $7 billion. His comments are of great concern on this consolidation. Do you share concerns about a consolidation amongst banks across America? Mr. Powell. I would speak for myself. I realize that community banks are tremendously important in their communities, and it is not a better world when community banks go out of business. At the same time, if there needs to be consolidation, I don't think we should be standing in the way of that. But we don't want to be part of the reason why community banks are going out of business or being forced to merge because of, for example, high fixed costs because of regulation or other things. Mr. Nunn. I would agree with you, Mr. Chairman. We don't want to be the instigator for a small bank to have to go out and stop serving the local community. As we look at Basel III, if it is finalized in early 2025, does that mean we will push implementation back to 2026? Mr. Powell. I don't know exactly what it would be, but something like that is right. We would have a typical phase-in process at the end of the--there's quite a lot of work to do to get to a final rule, and then, there will be a phase-in process. I don't know exactly what the date would be. Mr. Nunn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to know kind of a timeline for my folks--there is obviously 2026. Or take my advice, scrap it altogether, and we can start over if we even need to do that. Let me ask very quickly, with Chevron overturned, is there anything the Fed is doing to identify areas where maybe we have overregulated on the Federal side and you are still policing right now? Mr. Powell. Under the Chevron decision? Mr. Nunn. Yes. Mr. Powell. Again, our view is we are very focused on obeying the law and reading the actual words of the law and interpreting it according to the words that are in the law. This is the way we approach things. And I am not sure how much will change. Basically, a court will be doing that with a little bit less deference to the agency. But we think we are already interpreting the law pretty carefully. And, again, these are brand new decisions. There are several of them. And it is very early. We are just studying them now. Mr. Nunn. Thank you, Chairman Powell. And I hope you continue to self-police. Much appreciation to you and your team. And thank you, Chairman McHenry. Chairman McHenry. I will now recognize the gentleman from North Carolina, my friend, Mr. Nickel, for 5 minutes. Mr. Nickel. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. Welcome back, Chair Powell. I represent a Republican-leaning, very purple district, so my constituents sent me here to get things done. It has been disappointing that we are on track for what I believe could be the least-productive Congress in our nation's history. But this committee has done some good bipartisan work on the digital assets market structure bill and stablecoins. It is a place where I have hope that we are going to see some action in this Congress. I know you and I have spoken privately about stablecoins, and here in the House, in a bipartisan way, we have been working diligently to pass a bill to regulate payment stablecoins. This committee voted in favor of the legislation in a bipartisan way last year, and there have been numerous calls from this committee to you and to the Fed asking that you prioritize working with Congress to help push this legislation forward. We have enjoyed our conversations with staff as well. Can you commit to directing your staff to finalize and support passage of stablecoin legislation this year? Mr. Powell. We have been really pleased to take part in this process and very much appreciate being included in it, and we will stay with it. We think it is really important that we have a Federal framework for stablecoins. And again, we will be all in on working with you to get that done. Mr. Nickel. Thank you very much. A big issue for the folks that I represent is housing. The rising cost of housing hits my constituents especially hard in North Carolina. Our ranking member, Maxine Waters, has made this a big priority for the work that we do in the committee. In North Carolina, we have 343,000 households that spend over half of their monthly income on rent, leaving little money for other expenses like healthcare, transportation, and food. Access to safe and affordable housing is essential to the well- being of working families and individuals in North Carolina and around the country. Chair Powell, despite the strong economic trends you mentioned in your testimony, housing prices and median rents have increased by nearly 50 percent, and 41 percent, respectively, since May of 2020, and they continue to rise. In fact, housing costs continue to outpace modest wage gains. High interest rates continue to add to those costs. For example, high interest rates make it more expensive for home builders to finance new housing. High interest rates also cause landlords to charge higher rents and lead to higher mortgage costs for would-be homebuyers. I know that you and your colleagues at the Fed are correctly focused on bringing down inflation, an important goal, but have you considered that at this point, with housing cost increases being the primary driver of inflation, keeping interest rates high only thwarts that stated goal? Mr. Powell. There are a couple of things that are happening with housing. Before the pandemic, there was a pretty serious housing shortage, and we can't do anything about that. Then, the pandemic came along. We really think the best thing, the most important thing we can do for the housing market in the medium- and longer-term is to get inflation under control so that interest rates can come down, so that we can get back to a more normal interest rate. No one knows exactly where interest rates will go, but they will be lower than they are now. And the housing market supply and demand will work their way out, and you will have a supply of housing. There is still going to be a housing shortage at the end of that, though. And it is true that our policies work through interest- sensitive spending. Housing is maybe the most interest- sensitive form of spending, buying houses with a mortgage. We know that we have really significant effects in that market, and it is tough on people. But this is the path to getting inflation down, which will bear fruit for many, many years. Mr. Nickel. Thanks so much. I don't think I am going to be able to get in my next question in the limited time I have, but I wanted to give you this opportunity, if you would like it. I have talked to you privately about this, and I have a pretty good idea what you will say, but if you would like to say that the economy is, ``heading for a soft landing,'' you are welcome to say, ``soft landing,'' as much as you would like right now. Mr. Powell. I will say that for some time, I have thought there is a path to getting back to full price stability while keeping the unemployment rate low. There is that path. We have been on it. We are very, very focused on staying on that path. I would say we are at a place now where the risks to the two mandates are much more in balance than they were, and that means it is not just about getting inflation down. The job is not done on inflation. We have more work to do there. But at the same time, we need to be mindful of where the labor market is; we have seen considerable softening in the labor market. We still have a strong labor market, with low unemployment, and this is what we are very focused on continuing to work toward. Mr. Nickel. Thank you very much. Mr. Powell. Thank you. Mr. Nickel. And I yield back. Mr. Barr. . The gentlewoman from Texas, Ms. De La Cruz, is now recognized. Ms. De La Cruz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Chair Powell, for being here today. I appreciate that. I represent a working-class area in south Texas. In fact, my district is mostly Hispanic, one of the most-Hispanic districts in the entire nation, over 80 percent. And my district is also a rural community, so the topic today greatly affects my constituents, and it is something personal for me. That being said, the population that I represent is a population that Federal Reserve research has shown will be disproportionately the hardest hit in inflation. That being said, higher prices due to Biden's induced inflation is something not only the nation is feeling, but my constituents are feeling. They are feeling it at the grocery store. They are feeling it at the gas pump. Small businesses are feeling this. And we know that cutting back on their spending, people who are living paycheck to paycheck, they still can't get away from these increasing costs at the grocery store or the gas station. So, even small changes have a big impact in rural communities like mine. In fact, the Farm Bureau recently said that the cost of the Fourth of July celebration had high, high, increases. The headline reads, ``Record-High Fourth of July Cookout Costs: Inflation Hits the Backyard.'' This report says that costs were up 5 percent from last year, and up 30 percent from just a few years ago, all during the Biden Administration. Now, the Biden Administration wants us to simply forget about the last 3 years and the pain it has caused families in my district. They don't understand why people are unhappy about their current economic situation. And, quite frankly, it is angering, and it is simply out of touch with the everyday American. It seems obvious that until we grapple with the runaway government spending, that, unfortunately, we are going to continue to have runaway inflation. Chairman Powell, can you explain to us how the excessive government spending not only increases the national debt but also affects inflation as well? Mr. Powell. Sure. Let me say, first of all, we completely understand that inflation hurts people, low- and moderate- income people, directly and immediately in a way that it doesn't affect even middle-class people, because when paying more for the necessities of life when you don't have much of a financial safety net, the pain starts right away. We get that. So, it is for those people, among others, that we are doing everything we can to get inflation under control and stay at the job until it is done. In terms of the causes of inflation, the inflation that we are having is not that different from what other advanced economies around the world are having. And it really results from--inflation is low, the pandemic comes along, we shut down the economy, and people are sent checks to replace their income, but they can't spend that money because they can't go to the movie theater or to a football game because everything is closed, so savings go up. And people aren't spending a lot. Ms. De La Cruz. Chair Powell, I only have a minute left, so I want to shift gears quickly. I continue to believe that the Federal banking agencies, including the Fed, should scrap the flawed Basel III Endgame proposal and start over. At this point, the last thing a first-time homebuyer, a small business owner, and constituents, as you said, low-income people, who are rural people, for example, in my community, the last thing they need is harder access to capital, which is exactly what that proposal does. The public knows it and doesn't want it either, with a whopping 97 percent of public comments being negative for this proposal. Chair Powell, don't you agree that with the overwhelmingly negative reception of this proposal, that it shows a lack of public support? Mr. Powell. I do think that is fair to say. Ms. De La Cruz. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Barr. The gentlewoman from Colorado, Ms. Pettersen, is now recognized. Ms. Pettersen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for your service in such difficult times. We sign up to serve, and we don't know what is going to come our way. And I think about what we have been through as a country, with a global pandemic, the economy in collapse, and what this Congress was able to do, to infuse money to keep our small businesses afloat, to keep critical services available, and to make sure that we were in a position for the quickest, strongest recovery in the world. And while we have a lot to feel proud of, we recognize and have had many conversations throughout this committee about the pain points that people are continuing to feel with rising costs. And you touched on this. I really appreciate the discussion around housing in an earlier question because this is the greatest inflationary cost, especially in Colorado, where we have seen significant home price increases, and a lack of supply. People aren't able to move because they would go to a much higher interest rate. And then, people aren't able to buy because they can't afford those mortgage payments. And while you have talked about recognizing that lowering the interest rates will actually help with addressing the housing crisis, we still have a lack of housing supply. Can you talk a little bit more about what is happening and that the lower interest rates are only a piece of this? Mr. Powell. It is a longer-term thing, and a lot of it is that it is harder to get lots and zoning and materials and workers. And in many, many metropolitan areas, the near-in areas are all built up. If you look around Washington--I grew up near Washington, D.C., and it was countryside just a couple of miles outside the Beltway. There was no Beltway when I was born. But, ultimately, it is just that we don't have enough housing, and that was true before the pandemic, and certainly, the pandemic did slow down housing construction. I think we will get back to a more normal economy with lower interest rates and those sorts of things, but we are still going to have a housing shortage. Ms. Pettersen. Absolutely. When I think about the other pieces of the fallout from the global pandemic and the changes that we saw in our economy was in commercial real estate. And I have continued to read about regional bank failures and the risk that commercial real estate poses in the long-term for those assets being on the books for banks. What is your insight on the risk that it poses for financial stability and what we should be thinking about here in Congress? Mr. Powell. The commercial real estate situation, which is significantly downtown office and related retail and things like that, this is something the banks have been working their way through for the last couple of years. I think it will take more time, more years to work all the way through it. We know from the stress tests, and from our own work, that the large banks are going to be okay. Some of the regional banks and smaller banks have what you would expect, which is high concentrations in their local community of real estate. We are aware of those. The banks are aware of it. I think the supervisors have been around those banks making sure they have capital, they have liquidity, they have a reasonable, not-too-optimistic assessment of how much capital they will need, and of how big the losses will be. So, I think we will be working through this. And it doesn't seem to be a systemic problem or one that threatens broader financial stability. It does threaten bank profitability and those sorts of things, and it will be with us for a while. But we will just keep working our way through it. Ms. Pettersen. And the ability to continue to loan to small businesses because you are being locked up. You are not going to have enough time to answer this question, but my remaining outstanding question is around the recent Chevron ruling and how you anticipate that impacting the Fed's ability to adjust to the needs of the country and ensure financial stability without being sued at every turn. Mr. Powell. We are just looking at all these new decisions. In its early stage, I speak under the control of my General Counsel. I don't want to cause him to strike me. Ms. Pettersen. That is how I feel about my staff--I mean, not striking me. Mr. Powell. No, but ultimately, we are already very careful at the Fed about keeping within the law, we are really committed to that value, and this ruling doesn't change that. And I think we will continue to be an institution that is strongly committed to the rule of law. Ms. Pettersen. Great. Thank you so much. I yield back. Mr. Powell. Thank you. Mr. Barr. The gentlelady yields back. The gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. Fitzgerald, is recognized. Mr. Fitzgerald. Chairman Powell, thanks for being here. There has been a lot of talk about Basel III. I wanted to just change the subject a little bit. I think the long-term debt proposal should be rewritten and reproposed as well, but at the very least, the rule needs to be tailored as the law requires so that regional banks aren't treated more harshly than the largest banks. In particular, the requirement for regional banks to hold long-term debt at both the holding company and insured depository institution, that seems to be a burden, is what we are hearing, I think. I just wanted to mention that I would hope that there would be some flexibility for smaller regional banks to pre-position resources because there obviously--there are some resources that are lost. I don't know, lost, absorbing, I guess is the way you would consider them in the reproposal. Do you have any thoughts on kind of how this is playing out right now or what this looks like? Mr. Powell. Yes. On the long-term debt thing, we put it out for comment. We have received quite a few comments and staff has been analyzing them and that is something of which we are well aware, the concerns that have been raised, and we are thinking carefully about how to move forward on that. The other one was pre-positioning. That is more along the lines of the discount window and the liquidity requirements, I take it? Mr. Fitzgerald. Right. Mr. Powell. We haven't made a proposal there yet. We are thinking carefully about that. I think we are trying to learn the right lessons from what happened last spring at Silicon Valley Bank and a couple of other banks. And one of them is that the discount window worked, but we could certainly modernize it and make it more effective. And also, we learned that bank runs are moving just a whole lot faster, at least in that case, and that even bank runs from 10 or 15 years ago were nothing like as fast as what happened at Silicon Valley Bank. So, we need to bake that new learning into the liquidity requirements in some way or other. We, again, haven't made a proposal. When we do, of course, it will go out for comment, and we will very much want to learn from those comments. Mr. Fitzgerald. Very good. There has been a clear trend of banks stepping away from the mortgage market kind of in the face of the increased regulation. That is my interpretation at least. Nonbank lenders have stepped in to kind of fill that void. Today, banks support the nonbank lenders in the broader housing finance system through the so-called warehouse lending for home mortgages. But I am deeply concerned that some of the--as was mentioned by my colleagues earlier--Basel rules could harm both bank and nonbank lenders alike, kind of undermining the liquidity and raising the costs for homebuyers. Let me just ask, in regards to Basel III, the Endgame proposal, could it make housing finance less stable, I guess is the question? Mr. Powell. That is certainly not the intention, and we are, again, well aware of the concerns that have been raised, and we are certainly paying careful attention to those concerns. Mr. Fitzgerald. Despite the smaller issuer exemption for the debit interchange fee cap, issuers with less than $10 billion of assets reportedly lost about 35 percent of inflation in just interchange revenue. Have you considered the impact that further reduction of debt interchange will have on small financial institutions with less than $10 billion of assets? Mr. Powell. Yes. That is another one where we put out a proposal. We got a lot of comments, and we are carefully reviewing those, and we are certainly aware of the specific concern that you raised. Mr. Fitzgerald. As you may know, the latest FR Y-14 proposal, which is used to help collect data for Fed stress tests, asked banks for more detailed data on bank lending to nonbanks. As a result, there is concern that the Fed may start trying to indirectly regulate nonbanks and the financial risk. I just talked to one this morning that is concerned about that. Given those concerns raised about the lack of transparency in its stress testing models and the potential unintended consequences, is the Fed planning to indirectly regulate nonbank financial institutions through these tests? Mr. Powell. That is not the idea. The idea is we see intermediation growing very quickly in nonbanks. And we don't regulate them. We don't have a secret plan to regulate them or anything like that. But the question is, what risks are being kept inside the banking system, which we do regulate and supervise, and what are the relationships between these large nonbanks and banks? We don't have a preconceived answer to that. We just want to understand what are those business relationships like, and what kind of risk does that mean the banks are running. That is all it is. Mr. Fitzgerald. Thank you, Chairman. I yield back. Mr. Barr. The gentlewoman from New York, Ms. Velazquez, is now recognized. Ms. Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Chairman Powell, for being here today. Once the Fed is reassured that inflation is under control, what does the path back to neutral interest rates look like? Mr. Powell. We said that we wouldn't reduce rates until we were confident that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent. I think the question of what is neutral is going to be an empirical question. I think it seems to me it is unlikely that we will be going back to the very low interest rates of the pre-crisis period, but we won't know that until we get there, in a way. Ms. Velazquez. And the Fed's dual mandate is comprised of price stability and maximum sustainable employment. As the Fed is thinking about inflation and the possibility of interest rate cuts, how are you balancing this priority with the need to maximize employment? Mr. Powell. Over the past couple of years, we have had a very strong labor market and inflation well above target and that has led us to focus mainly on bringing down inflation. Over the course of 2 years, inflation has come down pretty significantly. There is more work to do there. We are not at our target. We need to keep on that job. At the same time, the labor market has cooled pretty significantly. And so, I would say those two goals are now much closer to being in balance, and that means, from a policy standpoint, we need to be paying attention to both of them. Whereas, for the last couple of years, we had to mostly pay attention to inflation. Ms. Velazquez. Chairman Powell, I have told you that I will be asking for a status update on the Section 956 rulemaking at every future hearing. Since your last appearance in March, several of your fellow regulators have issued a proposed rule. Why did the Fed choose not to sign on to this proposal? Mr. Powell. What we are doing is we are looking at the current state of affairs as it relates to incentive compensation. As you may know, we have had guidance in place now since 2010 for all banks, and we supervise pretty significantly around that. So, it is a very different picture than the one that was there in 2010. And we are asking ourselves, what is the situation today, and how do we tailor a proposal to address the residual risk, as opposed to what the situation was in 2010 ? Ms. Velazquez. Yes. In previous hearings, you said that you need to better understand the problem in order to write the rule. In a speech in June, SEC Commissioner Lizarraga said, ``It has been well documented that in the lead-up to the financial crisis, pay structures often encouraged big bets that maximized short-term profits but ignored bigger, longer-term risks that threatened to take down the entire financial system.'' Additionally, since your last appearance, several of your fellow regulators have moved forward with a proposed rule. Why have your fellow regulators and Commissioner Lizarraga been able to understand the scope of the problem and the Fed has not? Mr. Powell. I think the quote absolutely makes my point, which is, I think everyone agrees that incentive compensation practices before the global financial crisis were not in a good place. However, we published guidance on incentive compensation binding on all--not binding--but guidance for all banks in 2010 after putting it out for comment. A lot of thought went into that guidance, and now, we supervise on that guidance. So, the situation with incentive compensation now in banks is completely different than it was before the global financial crisis, completely different. Ms. Velazquez. The other regulators have been able to figure this out and you haven't. But let me just say, this is not how congressional mandates work. Of all the rulemaking provisions in the Dodd-Frank, only 148 were mandatory, and of those, only 22 had a deadline of less than a year after enactment. Section 956 was one of them. And I hope that you come to the conclusion that it is your duty to issue the regulation. Thank you. And I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Powell. Section 156 requires either a rule or guidance, by the way. It does not require a rule. Thank you. Mr. Barr. The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Donalds, is now recognized. Mr. Donalds. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Powell, it is good to see you. Let's cover a lot of different areas of ground. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, since President Biden took office, the price of goods has continued to outpace family incomes, with prices increasing now 19.3 percent, while average weekly earnings have only increased 14.6 percent. So, families have fallen behind with respect to their purchasing power that they are able to go and acquire goods. What role has government spending played in creating this untenable economic crisis? Mr. Powell. Close that door, please. Sorry. I can't hear very well when the door is open. Mr. Donalds. I will repeat the question. That is fine. Mr. Powell. No, no, I heard you. Mr. Donalds. Oh, okay. Mr. Powell. That door needs to be closed. So, what role? Government spending is part of the story. So, government spent. We had our rates really low. The pandemic happened, and we closed the economy, and then reopened it, and I think you saw a burst of inflation everywhere in the world, and certainly, there were many contributors to that. Mr. Donalds. Do you think that the President in his budget calling for an increase of Federal spending, upwards of 5 percent increase in Federal spending across-the-board, do you think that is going to have further implications on stubborn inflation plaguing the pocketbooks of the American people? Mr. Powell. It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the President's budget. Mr. Donalds. The only reason why I would ask, Mr. Powell, is because, obviously, the Federal Reserve is having to respond to various aspects of fiscal policy coming from Capitol Hill. Regardless of the President's budget, would it be appropriate in the current environment for Federal spending to increase by 5 percent, 10 percent, or 15 percent? Mr. Powell. Honestly, that is a question for elected Representatives. We don't play a role in fiscal policy. Mr. Donalds. Fair enough. Is it the view of yourself and the Federal Reserve Board that fiscal policy does create impacts on the Fed's ability to manage monetary policy for the United States? Mr. Powell. We take fiscal policy as a given, and we are not commentators. We are not the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of Management and Budget. Whatever fiscal policy happens up here, we decline all opportunities to be commentators on it. We take it as a given. And that is because we didn't run for office. We don't have that job. We stick to our knitting. And the fact that we are independent really depends on us sticking to what our assignment is, which is to deal with things with the economy as it is. Mr. Donalds. I would argue that the fiscal policy of the United States has given you guys a lot more to deal with and whatever the various burdens that come with it. Unfortunately, you have to tangle with it, but the American consumers are the ones who truly have to deal with it. I want to move on. The Monetary Policy Report cites a pickup in immigration as one of the major factors that has improved the supply of labor; however, the labor force participation rate remains below pre-pandemic levels. What percentage of the increase of foreign-born labor supply, to your knowledge, comes from illegal immigration? Mr. Powell. What percentage of the--say it again, the question? Mr. Donalds. What percentage of foreign-born labor comes from illegal immigration? Mr. Powell. I think all of foreign-born labor comes from immigration. Mr. Donalds. No, illegal immigration. Mr. Powell. Illegal? Sorry. I didn't get that. Mr. Donalds. Yes, sir. Mr. Powell. I don't know the answer to that. Mr. Donalds. Okay. One of the things I think would be important to help, I guess advise Congress on what to do going forward, is if the Federal Reserve had some data in that regard to help us make further decisions into the future. Chairman Powell, let me ask you this one overarching question. Obviously, interest rates, if you compare them over the last 15 years of monetary policy, are at an elevated rate. Does the Fed anticipate any possibility of rates being lowered, whether it is 50 basis points, or 100 basis points, at some point over the next year or two? Mr. Powell. I guess if the question really is, where are interest rates going to settle out when all of the effects of the pandemic are really done, no one knows. This is a great discussion to have. But I think my sense is that we probably won't go back to that era between the global financial crisis and a pandemic where rates were very, very low and inflation was very low and extremely low. There were major European countries that had negative 10- year bond rates, negative, and that was not the case here. But I don't think we are going back to rates that are that low. We think that things like the neutral rate are driven by slow-moving forces, but, ultimately, you can see the effect. Our policy rate is over 5 percent now, and it feels like policy is restrictive but not intensely restrictive. That suggests that the neutral rate of interest, at least as of now, will have risen somewhat, which means rates will be a little higher. Mr. Donalds. Okay. Thank you so much. I yield back. Mr. Powell. Thank you. Mr. Fitzgerald. . The gentleman yields back. We now go to the gentleman from California, Mr. Sherman, who is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Sherman? Would you like us to move on? Mr. Sherman. If it is Josh's turn, it is Josh's turn. Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Gottheimer. Thank you, Mr. Sherman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Powell, you have said that, ``Custody assets are off-balance-sheet, always have been.'' Do you stand by that? Mr. Powell. Sorry. Say that again? Mr. Gottheimer. You have said that, ``Custody assets are off-balance-sheet, always have been.'' Do you stand by that statement, sir? Mr. Powell. I think as a general matter, yes. Mr. Gottheimer. The SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121) affects a core banking activity: custody. This specific bulletin requires banks to put digital assets held in custody on their balance sheet, effectively keeping banks out of the market entirely. Have the Fed and the SEC had conversations about the impact of SAB 121? I just want to get a sense of your thoughts on the policy, please? Mr. Powell. We don't comment on the SEC's policy. They don't comment on our policies, either. You knew you were going to SAB 121 on that. But, honestly, it is the SEC's business, not ours. Mr. Gottheimer. Thank you. Last month, you said that when evaluating inflation data, you consider whether wage growth is outpacing productivity. From 1979 to 2019, middle-class workers' productivity grew about 60 percent while their wages grew by about 16 percent. Do you consider this historical gap when considering whether to hike rates on families who are obviously struggling to make ends meet? Mr. Powell. We are looking at inflation, and we are looking at maximum employment. Those are our goals. We don't really have the ability--we don't have a bunch of different tools for things like what you are talking about. So really, it is just those things. We are, of course, really well aware of longer-run trends like that. You have to also include benefits, though, in that analysis, which does close that gap quite a bit. You just mentioned wages. Mr. Gottheimer. I appreciate that. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, yesterday the Director of National Intelligence said that, ``Iranian Government actors have sought to opportunistically take advantage of ongoing protests regarding the war in Gaza.'' They have, ``observed actors tied to Iran's Government posing as activists online, seeking to encourage protests, and even providing financial support to protesters.'' As a member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, I am equally concerned about our adversaries meddling in our financial system. Can you discuss if you are working with other Federal agencies to investigate and address foreign interference channeled through our financial institutions? Mr. Powell. We do take part in many of those things, especially at the staff level. And as you know, there is a lot of focus in the intelligence community. And it is very helpful to the banks, the commercial banks, and to us. But we are certainly very focused on those issues. We have a strong team. Of course, you are never able to sleep on cyber risk. But we just keep fighting it. Mr. Gottheimer. I would like to switch gears to the discount window, please. Chairman, we have heard that the discount window is behind the times in terms of its operations. We also continue to hear that efforts to modernize the discount window and encourage its use will be ineffective without reducing the associated stigma. The usability of the discount window is an important tool for banks that need liquidity. I just wanted to get a sense of efforts underway to make the discount window a more realistic option for banks that need liquidity. Mr. Powell. It is couple of things. First, it is that we need to modernize our infrastructure. The discount window in our system is not a primary source of credit. It is a source for banks that they can use under certain circumstances. But we know that the infrastructure is a little tired, and we are investing in that and making it more user-friendly and all that. So, that is a big, big project that is going on. The second point was stigma. That is a tough one. There are a lot of ways to get after that. We are studying all of them. In a sense, if you require banks to use the discount window, that can help with the stigma. I think this is a big ask. But when Congress required us to publish the names of discount window users, that didn't help. That doesn't help at all because banks basically say, ``We are not going to use the discount window because people might see us as troubled.'' And that is not what we want. We want people to be able to freely use the discount window. So, we have been focused on this issue for a long time. We have not made a lot progress on it. But right now, I think we are very focused on it. Mr. Gottheimer. Thank you, sir. I will yield back. Thank you. Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentleman yields back. We now go to the gentleman from New York, Mr. Lawler, who is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Lawler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Powell, to the best of my knowledge, the last public meeting between you and President Biden occurred on May 31, 2022. Does that sound accurate? Mr. Powell. I am going to take your word for it. Mr. Lawler. Okay. Have you had any private meetings with the President since that time? Mr. Powell. No. Mr. Lawler. Any phone calls with the President? Mr. Powell. No, I don't believe so. Mr. Lawler. Is there any reason why you have not met with or spoken to the President? Mr. Powell. When any President calls you, you come and you meet. But that hasn't happened. Mr. Lawler. So, in over 2 years, with inflation still nagging us, with costs out of control, President Biden has not asked to meet with you in over 2 years? Mr. Powell. I haven't had a meeting with him. He hasn't sought a meeting. And, of course, I don't seek meetings. So, you have the data; I don't. Mr. Lawler. But, to your knowledge, in the last 2 years, you have not spoken with or met with the President at all? Mr. Powell. I shook his hand in a line once, but that wasn't a conversation. It was just, ``Mr. President,'' and that was it. But that was at a State dinner. I attended a State dinner a few months ago, and I shook his hand. ``Good evening, Mr. President,'' and that was it. Mr. Lawler. Does that not strike you as odd that the President has not sought to meet with you? Mr. Powell. Not at all. Mr. Green. Mr. Chairman? Mr. Powell. We are an independent agency and---- Mr. Green. Mr. Chairman? Parliamentary inquiry, please, Mr. Chairman? Mr. Powell. I'm sorry. Mr. Green. Am I recognized? Mr. Powell. I want to answer your---- Mr. Fitzgerald. State your inquiry. Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I make a point of order under Clause 4 of Rule XVII that the gentleman's words are disorderly and violate the rules of decorum and debate insofar as they are negatively reflecting upon the personality of a candidate for President of the United States. Mr. Fitzgerald. The Congressman has not engaged in any personality or questioned anything about anyone at this point. I am not sure where you are going, Congressman. Mr. Green. We have---- Mr. Fitzgerald. The Congressman is recognized. Mr. Lawler. Thank you. Mr. Green. Mr. Chairman---- Mr. Lawler. Thank you. Mr. Green. Mr. Chairman---- Mr. Powell. I am happy to answer your question. Mr. Lawler. Thank you. Mr. Green. Mr. Chairman, I would like to continue with the point of order. Mr. Powell. It's not at all unusual. Mr. Fitzgerald. What is your point of order? Mr. Green. Mr. Chairman, we have been admonished in this committee that we should not have words that negatively reflect upon persons who are running for President. This would include Mr. Trump, as well as the current President. Mr. Lawler. Didn't the ranking member do a whole opening monologue diatribe---- Mr. Green. Mr. Chairman---- Mr. Lawler. ----about some ridiculous---- Mr. Green. Would you please rule my friend out of order, Mr. Chairman, until you rule? Mr. Fitzgerald. Mr. Lawler has---- Mr. Lawler. He has already ruled. Mr. Fitzgerald. ----not admonished or said anything negative about the President at all. I just listened to his comments. So, I am going to recognize the Congressman again. Mr. Lawler from New York is recognized. Mr. Lawler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Powell, you were trying to answer my question. Mr. Powell. We are an independent agency. The Administration has been very respectful of the Fed not wanting to try to influence things like that. And I don't find it at all unusual. Mr. Lawler. Okay. Since you made mention of the independence of the Fed, and I know you pride yourself on that independence, do you acknowledge or do Members of the FOMC acknowledge that a rate cut in September could be viewed as political, just 30 to 60 days before an election? Mr. Powell. Our undertaking is to make decisions when and as they need to be made based on the data, the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks, and not in consideration of other factors. And that would include political factors. We will make those decisions. We have a long history of doing that, including during election years, and that is the undertaking we will make. Anything we do will be very well- grounded. And it is just not appropriate for us to get into the business of thinking about election cycles at all one way or the other. Mr. Lawler. Inflation year over year from May 2023 to May 2024 is up 3.3 percent, overall inflation. Energy inflation is up 3.7 percent, food inflation is up 2.1 percent. With inflation continuing to be a challenge, do you see a rate cut as a possibility at this moment? Mr. Powell. I think you are quoting the Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers, which are operating at an unusually high gap to the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) numbers. For 25 years, the Fed has focused on inflation, PCE inflation. And usually, the gap to CPI is only 25 or 30 basis points. It is more now. So, the current PCE numbers are 2.6 percent for headline, 2.6 percent for core. And we have articulated for a good, long period our test for being willing to consider beginning to loosen policy. And that test is that we want to be more confident that inflation is moving on a path sustainably down to 2 percent, not at 2 percent but on a path sustainably at 2 percent. That is the test we have articulated. I have some confidence, as I said earlier, that we are on a downward path. I think if you look at the data, it is pretty clear. But we have not said, though, that we have sufficient confidence. And that will be a decision that our Committee makes. Mr. Lawler. I would just note that, obviously, CPI, the price of goods, the price of purchasing a home, the price of a mortgage, the cost of a mortgage has been astronomical. In Westchester County, for instance, which I represent, the average mortgage cost is up a thousand dollars a month, over $12,000 a year. Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, is now recognized for his 5 minutes. Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I thank Chair Powell for appearing today. I hope things are going well with you. I know that this is a difficult time for you. And, quite frankly, you have been at a difficult time for a number of years. And you have proved to be quite resilient and quite effective at what you do. So, I thank you for what you are doing. I do want to ask you about several things, and I hope that I will get to them. But, first, there was a post-failure lessons report after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. I thought that report was pretty important. How important is that post-failure lessons report? Mr. Powell. It is important. We wanted to learn the right lessons and make the right changes to both our rules but also really to our supervisory practices more than anything else, and we are doing that. Mr. Green. And is this something that you believe to be important after each incident such as what happened with Silicon Valley Bank and the other banks? Mr. Powell. Yes, I think we all have a lot to be humble about, and we try to learn from events. Mr. Green. Thank you. Let me go on to the next question, which has to do with the banks that are small. Let's talk about those that are less than $5 billion in total assets, yet they are subject to the special assessments of the FDIC once their systemic risk exception is triggered. I would like to see them exempt from that. Do you have any comments on that? Mr. Powell. That is either a statutory matter or it is a matter of the FDIC's practice. So, it is not something the Fed really has any input into. Mr. Green. Okay. Let's do this next, please, as time runs out. Would you kindly finish your commentary? You were giving a comment on the pandemic and how the pandemic helped to generate this inflation, and you were stopped in the middle of your comments. Would you go back through that, please, so that the public at large can get a better understanding of what actually happened with the pandemic and inflation? Mr. Powell. I would be glad to. I think people are now--we have had a few years to look back. I think the more years that pass, the clearer we can see what was happening. But I think when you look back now and you are seeing this, broadly, what was happening was governments did a lot to support economic activity during the pandemic on the theory that there could be really serious economic bad times ahead. Then, the economy reopened. And it reopened very, very strongly. And I think, in hindsight, you can see that there was just a lot of support for demand from fiscal policy, from monetary policy, and that supply was constrained. You couldn't make cars. Supply chains were tangled up. There were shortages of so many things. What happened was we got a burst of inflation, and the United States got a big burst of inflation really more from demand than other countries did. Then, you had the war in Ukraine, which gave a big burst of inflation, more to Europe than to us. And so, you wind up with a situation where you just have a lot of inflation. And our thinking, my thinking at the time was it is going to take restrictive monetary policy and it is going to take time for the supply side and demand side distortions from the pandemic to unwind. And 2023 was the year when that kind of happened. Supply chains were fixed, the labor shortage was greatly alleviated, and unemployment remained very low. Inflation came down by a very large amount last year, while growth remained quite strong. So, this was the year that kind of proved that thesis. Now we are in 2024, and it is question of finishing the job on inflation, which we are committed to do, while also keeping a strong labor market, which we are also committed to doing. And that is a balance that we have to strike in our policy. But I think we know more now about where this came from, because we can see what made it go away. And it was a combination of supply and demand, as we had kind of expected. Mr. Green. And two of the most significant factors were the pandemic and the war with Ukraine? Is that correct? Mr. Powell. Yes, and it is also the fact that the pandemic summoned forth a great fiscal and monetary response, and that contributed to really strong activity and to inflation, without question. Mr. Green. I am going to run out of time, but I have to ask, if not for that monetary response--I know that it is a counterfactual--would we have possibly gone into a depression? Mr. Powell. That is what we thought at the time. And I think mainstream economists were very concerned that we never literally shut the global economy down for a period and then tried to reopen it. We didn't know how long it would take or how well that would go. Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentleman's time has expired. We now go to the gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Lucas, who is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Lucas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Chairman Powell, for testifying today. I realize that by my questioning point in the hearing today, probably a lot of material has been covered. But there is never anything wrong with asking important questions a second or third time. You have reiterated how Members of the Board would like to see a revised Basel proposal put out for public comment, and you are working through the process with the FDIC and the OCC. From my perspective, the FDIC is in a period of uncertainty, with the current Chairman announcing he will resign to restore confidence in his agency. And the replacement is awaiting Senate confirmation hearings. And, at the OCC, we have an Acting Comptroller who has not yet been confirmed by the Senate. At the very least, given the expected broad revisions, I hope the other agencies agree that a complete reproposal would be appropriate. Chairman Powell, could you give me some indication of what the potential timeline around such a decision reproposed might look like? Mr. Powell. It is pretty uncertain, but I will give it a shot. Mr. Lucas. Please. Mr. Powell. I will say again that these discussions we have been having with the other two agencies have been very constructive, and we very much want that to continue. We have pretty good agreement on the substance, and now, it is about the process. So, a baseline might be that we agree on a reproposal of some kind that gives the public a chance to see these changes and react to them and write comment letters. And that could happen. It would take us a while to write it up. And then, we would put it out for comment for 60 days. I think that couldn't happen probably until part of the way through the fall. Then, there would be, let's say, 60 days of comment. Then, we get the comments. We would have to then evaluate the comments and think carefully about them. Having done that, we would have to write up the final version and that would take some time. My guess is that puts you well into next year. As I mentioned, these are rules that the banks are going have to live with for a long time, and we need to get them right. It is not something we should be hurrying; we need to take our time and get it right and make sure that we hear the comments. This is a very big piece of regulation. A lot of things will need to be changed. There are a lot of good things in there. We want to come out with a good proposal, and that is what it will take. Mr. Lucas. To shift years on you, Chairman, the 2024 stress test focused on commercial real estate risk, which is an area we have all been paying close attention to here on this committee. Do you agree that the results showed the financial system to be strong? Mr. Powell. Yes, I do. Mr. Lucas. Folks back home are always very concerned about inflation and the period we have gone through lately, not just the basic necessities that continue to explode but the cost of doing business and all those other issues. The fact is the inflation is still running above the Fed's 2-percent target, and we have seen significant price increases in food and energy over recent years. As you and I have discussed before, I started out as a young farmer in 1977 in that inflationary period during the Carter years. Then, we went through Chairman Volcker's rather, shall we say, dramatic tightening of monetary policy. And I still remember paying 17 percent to borrow cow feed money when I was a student in college. I was well-collateralized, but that was a bargain in the fact that the capital was accessible So, I am particularly sensitive, being a part of that generation, to the fact that if inflation isn't effectively dealt with, it can spiral out of control. Could you expand for a little bit more about your approach in dealing with inflation in a way that doesn't repeat the mistakes of the past? I just want to avoid the mistakes of the past. Mr. Powell. I think really one of the big lessons coming out of the high inflation of the 1970s, which we both lived through, is that it really is on the central bank to be on the case and do the job and make sure that it is fully well and truly done, and that really is up to the central bank. Believe it or not, that wasn't fully accepted or that wasn't necessarily the thinking. And also, the independence of central banks was much less respected back then. So, all the more credit to Paul Volcker for having the courage to do it. That is an internalized lesson for people in central banking these days. We do understand that. We are committed to bringing inflation sustainably down to 2 percent. Mr. Lucas. One last question in my remaining seconds. You and the leadership of the Fed will be there the day before the election this fall, and you will be there the day after the election. There will still be the same people carefully watching the Fed's responsibilities, correct? Mr. Powell. This is my fourth Presidential election at the Fed, and I can tell you we come to work the next day, and we do our jobs. Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentleman's time has expired. Mr. Lucas. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Fitzgerald. We now go to the gentleman from California, Mr. Sherman. Mr. Sherman. Coming out of COVID, everyone said a soft landing was impossible, and a recession was inevitable. I want to commend you and the Administration. It looks like we have seen a soft landing. We have continued to have historically-low unemployment rates and historically-low unemployment rates for people of color. And, in the last 18 months, we have seen a 4.7 point decline in the inflation rate as measured by the Consumer Price Index. I realize you may not have done the calculations, but I did the calculations, and it is the greatest decline that we have seen in an 18-month period this century. Do you have any reason to disagree with that? Mr. Powell. I hope that is true, and I am glad you said it because it is certainly a lot. I can't validate that statement, though. Mr. Sherman. I am sure you have a fine staff who will do the calculation, and hopefully, we will see the press release. When Treasury Secretary Yellen was here yesterday, I addressed an issue with which both you and she should be concerned. I have always opposed Operation Choke Point where, for political reasons, banks wouldn't provide or might not provide financial services. Florida and Tennessee had passed laws giving anybody who is denied a bank account or even a loan a way to claim that it was for political reasons. And it opens up the possibility that banks would be pressured by those laws to release their suspicious activity reports, which are, I understand, supposed to be private. So, I hope you will work with the Secretary in making sure that the laws of Florida and Tennessee do not adversely affect our ability to deal with suspicious financial circumstances. You have a dual mandate. And I think you have a third mandate that is implied, because the budget deficit poses a great risk to price stability and to keeping unemployment low. And you don't deal with spending. You don't deal with taxation. But in two ways, you dramatically affect the budget deficit. The Federal Government is the biggest borrower in the history of the world. Interest rates affect the forthcoming budget deficit, and at times you have turned over to the Federal Government up to a hundred billion dollars in profit. So, I hope that you would consider whether your first two mandates imply that you at least have to look at how your policies affect the budgets deficit. I hope that you will go with republication of Basel III and insist on that. I know you are dealing with two other regulators on that. A recent assessment by PricewaterhouseCoopers showed that the original proposal would lead to higher borrowing costs for small and medium-sized businesses. And, in every way, Basel III seemed to be slanted toward telling the banks go and put your money on Wall Street where you just are going to have interest rate risk, and don't loan your money to local Main Street businesses because there is credit risk there. And, in fact, if you had a fair system, you would mark to market all bonds, not just those that are, ``available for sale.'' I hope also that, as you redo Basel III, you treat energy tax credits, green energy tax credits the same way you currently deal with Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, that you keep in mind the effect on the securities industry, particularly municipal bonds, that you don't unfairly say to local business that if it is a publicly-traded company, it counts only 65 percent, and that you look at mortgage servicing rights as an asset, and that you fully account for the private mortgage insurance. I know you give some credit for that. But, frankly, an 80 percent loan-to-value and a 90 percent loan-to-value that has private mortgage insurance pretty much exposes the bank to the same risk. I will ask you one question about debit cards. You are planning to provide only, I believe, a .3 per--3 cents additional charge for dealing with fraud prevention. Fraud has just skyrocketed. Would the Fed consider increasing the fraud-prevention adjustment before finalizing its proposal? Mr. Powell. That is part of the comments that we have received on the interchange rule. And it is a concern we are aware of, and we will take that into consideration. Mr. Sherman. I yield back. Mr. Williams of Texas. . The gentleman yields back. And the gentleman from the great State of Missouri, Congressman Luetkemeyer, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I certainly appreciate the thoughtful gentleman from California's remarks on some of the stuff. But I am kind of curious how--Chairman Powell, he indicated you have a third implied duty here to actually work with the budget. I really thought that only the Congress had the ability to impact the budget. We are the ones, not the Executive Branch, not the Judicial Branch; the Legislative Branch is the one that handles the budget. Am I mistaken on that, Mr. Chairman? Mr. Powell. I believe that is right. Mr. Luetkemeyer. I don't think you want our job on top of what you have. Mr. Powell. No. Mr. Luetkemeyer. One of the things that has come across my desk in the last few weeks here is that some of the legislatures this last year around the country have started to pass banking laws that infringe on Federal banking laws. Have you seen this? Are you aware of it? Do you have any thoughts on that? Can you tell me what your thoughts may be? Mr. Powell. Honestly, I have not seen that, and I---- Mr. Luetkemeyer. Okay. Mr. Powell. It wouldn't necessarily come across my desk. It might come across Vice Chair Barr's desk. Mr. Lawler. Okay. It was just concerning because you handle lots of banking rules and regulations, so we don't want to have the State usurp the duties and responsibilities and the legal ability to---- Mr. Powell. These are preemption issues? Mr. Luetkemeyer. Yes, preemption issues is what it is all about. Mr. Powell. Yes, that is a big deal for the OCC issue. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Yes, I was just curious if you had run across any of that, and had any thoughts on it? Mr. Powell. I haven't. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Okay. I just came out of a committee hearing with the House Small Business Committee a while ago. And there was a home builder individual there, a contractor. And he was talking about the cost of regulations, basically $1,000 increase in costs, with about 100,000 homes across the country not being able to be purchased because they are no longer affordable. And it brings up a point with regards to the cost of regulations. Do you fall under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)? Mr. Powell. Yes. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Part of that Act is to determine the costs of a regulation, correct, or the cost of compliance? Mr. Powell. I don't actually know the answer to that. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Okay. Mr. Powell. But I know we carefully follow the---- Mr. Luetkemeyer. Okay. Mr. Powell. ----the APA. Mr. Luetkemeyer. To me, that is a really important point from the standpoint of how you look at rules and regulations to ensure that the cost is not going to be more than the economic benefit of what you are doing. So, I would think this has to be part of your analysis. Mr. Powell. Certainly, we try to make our rules as efficient as possible and to get the job done. Mr. Luetkemeyer. One of the concerns we have is with--and I think the gentleman talked about the credit card situation here, Reg. II. And with regard to the Chevron doctrine basically being rescinded, how is that going to affect your rulemaking with regards to some of the more recent ones like Reg. II fees and stuff, the Basel rule? Are all of those things going to be impacted by this at all? Mr. Powell. It doesn't change our assignment under the Durbin Amendment to do the interchange rule. We are always focused as an institution on compliance with the law. We are a very law-abiding group. Mr. Luetkemeyer. But does it narrow your ability to go beyond or reinterpret laws and rules and things like that? Mr. Powell. No, that would be---- Mr. Luetkemeyer. It seems to me that is what the rule---- Mr. Powell. That would be a question for the courts. The courts will be asking the same question, which is what was Congress' intent with that law, and that is the question we are asking. But what they are saying is that courts will give less deference to agencies, I think. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Okay. Mr. Powell. Again, these decisions were just passed down. I was actually out of the country last week while this was all happening. I have had no time to be briefed on any of that. I am kind of speculating here. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Okay. One last question. I asked this question yesterday of Secretary Yellen. What keeps you up at night? What is your biggest concern with regards to your responsibilities, with regards to the economy, with regards to the banking system? What is your biggest concern? Mr. Powell. For a long time, it has been cyber. And the reason is, we know about credit crises and things like that and financial crises, but we haven't really had something where there is a successful cyber attack on a major financial institution or financial market utility. That has always been my answer. I would actually say the number-one thing that keeps me awake at night is the balance that I talked about before, which is, we are at a critical time where inflation is coming down, the labor market is cooling, and we want to get it right for the benefit of the American people. We want to get inflation down to 2 percent, but we want to keep a strong labor market, too. And trying to make decisions that give that the best chance to happen, is the thing that I think about in the wee hours. Mr. Luetkemeyer. We have talked about this before, too. You really have a tough job from the standpoint that you are trying to drive down demand, and the Administration, by spending all this money, is trying to drive it up. It puts you in a really big box, doesn't it? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Powell. Thank you. Mr. Luetkemeyer. I yield back. Mr. Williams of Texas. The gentleman yields back. The gentleman from the great State of Illinois, Mr. Foster, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Foster. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Chair Powell. I guess when things are going well, as they currently are, it is all of our duties to look around the curve and see the risks that keep you up at night. So, I appreciate Representative Luetkemeyer's question. Over the last few years, there has been increasing interest in synthetic risk transfers (SRTs) or credit-linked notes, which are often used by U.S. banks to shift risk away from the banking system and as a means of managing regulatory capital. I have been concerned by recent reports that the buyers of some of these SRTs may be investing in them using bank-provided leverage, in which case the risk could just boomerang right back into the banking system. Frankly, when I read about this, it triggered my PTSD from the AIG situation with credit default swaps during the financial crisis. Now, I understand the Federal Reserve plays a role in approving SRTs, and in fact, issued guidance to U.S. banks regarding their issuance last fall. Could you say a little bit about the ways these investments can be a safe way for banks to off-load risk and in what ways they could become a dangerous source of contagion? Mr. Powell. Sure. There could be a breakdown in a couple of places in the chain, as you are obviously aware. One is just that the risk isn't really well and fully transferred to the buyer, and that is--the first step is: Is that risk going away off the balance sheet in an unconditional kind of a way, in a way that the bank understands? And it is a good thing if banks are able to do that. Then, the question is, is it coming back through the back door with financing? And we are well aware of that. Banks do tend to bring these things to us, and we look at them carefully. We understand some of the ways it can go wrong. But at the end of the day, if it works to reduce the risk on a bank's balance sheet, that is something with which we should be okay. Mr. Foster. But there is the--well, if you could just say, what sort of insight and control does the Federal Reserve have into all the conditions, particularly the connection may go through businesses that you do not have direct, nonbank entities that you may not have direct oversight over? Mr. Powell. My understanding is that this is a very active dialogue we are having with banks. They want to know how this is going to be treated. They don't want to do something that is going to come back on them or that we will deny the treatment on. So, I think there is a pretty transparent set of exchanges around how these things work. We are very clear on what we think our requirements are. This is what I am told. We saw what went wrong the last time, and I don't think anyone wants to repeat, that including the banks. Mr. Foster. If you conclude, as you are actively studying it, that you need more visibility into certain areas of, particularly nonbank things that may be parts of the chain of contagion, please let us know, because it is our job to avoid the next crisis. I think it is my personal goal to die before we have another financial crisis, and then I will be doing my job well. Now, I understand also the value of SRTs in the U.S. are relatively small, and the bulk of these are offshore. Is the growth of this practice internationally something you are watching closely? And is there anything that might provide a sign of early trouble in terms of international contagion that might creep back in? Mr. Powell. I haven't heard that flavor of it, but I will check on that and let you know. Mr. Foster. Do you remember with AIG, the real problem with AIG falling into bankruptcy is that it would immediately put a bazillion of the European banks into violation of their capital requirements, which was major contagion that---- Mr. Powell. Yes. Mr. Foster. Do you have a sense of the time scale for the liquidity proposal at this point? Mr. Powell. I think the main thing is we have this very large, important project on Basel III. And I think we are pretty close to being able to move that out into the public view again. And I think, once we have done that, we can move on to the other things that are there. And one of them is the liquidity proposals, and I don't want to put a specific timeframe on it, but we are certainly working towards that sometime later this year, I would think. Mr. Foster. Later this year, we would have the first view of that? Mr. Powell. I would think so. Mr. Foster. Okay. I understand it is still under negotiation between agencies, but can you say directionally the Basel III re--the new amended proposal, is it just going to be in the direction of sort of a weakening at watering things down toward the current capital requirements? Or will there be areas where it is actually strengthening them? Mr. Powell. No, there will be a capital requirement in it that is consistent with Basel III and a capital increase that is consistent with Basel---- Mr. Foster. My question is, if you look at what the original proposal was compared to what you intend to put out, are you moving in the direction of more toward the current situation? And if so, if you can just interpolate? It seems like if you have comments on the proposal you put out, you understand comments on the status quo and you are somewhere between that, then maybe you don't need another set of comments because everything that can be said has been said. Mr. Powell. It is a little more complicated than that, but that is essentially right. You have current levels of capital, you have the proposal, and you have--which is a lot of gold- plating--and then, you have where it is shaking out. Mr. Foster. I was just wondering why you need more comments. Mr. Powell. There are many different pieces. Mr. Foster. Okay. Mr. Powell. The answer is there are many, many different pieces of that. Mr. Foster. Thank you. And I am over time. Mr. Williams of Texas. The gentleman's time is up. The gentlewoman from the great State of Indiana, Congresswoman Houchin, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. Houchin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to the ranking member. And thank you, Chairman Powell, for coming to speak with us today. It has been a long day. Thank you for being here this entire time. One of the greatest strengths of our financial services industry is the diversity of our banking system. I know firsthand how important it is for us to maintain options and choice for Americans, whether it is somebody looking to open a savings account or take out a loan to start a small business. Increasingly, however, we have seen consolidation in the banking industry and increased difficulty for smaller financial institutions to survive. One of the reasons for this is an excessive regulatory burden that many of the smaller banks face. While this can come in the form of new proposals and adjustments to liquidity requirements or to things like the Basel III Endgame, it can also be due to outdated technological capabilities at the agencies and inefficiencies in and within the examination process. Chairman Powell, could you just talk about what steps the Fed is taking to upgrade technology and procurements procedures and update training practices to ensure that the banks that you regulate don't face unnecessary burdens? Mr. Powell. To your point, the number of banks in the country has been coming down for 40 years. There is consolidation going on for a whole range of reasons, and we are not trying to foster that. We are not trying to push that. And we are aware that high fixed cost from regulations may be one of the reasons for that. So, we do try to keep that in mind, particularly for the smaller institutions. On your question around IT and specific things, I might take an opportunity to come back to you with somebody who is closer to the specific supervisory practices---- Mrs. Houchin. That would be great. Mr. Powell. It's a fair question. Mrs. Houchin. That would be great. And, just for reference, I was proud earlier this year to introduce a bill, the Fostering the Use of Technology to Uphold Regulatory Effectiveness in Supervision Act (FUTURES Act). It is an important bill that would require our Federal bank regulators to conduct an assessment to ensure that the technology and training systems they are using will improve and reduce the burden, especially on our smaller financial institutions. At the same time, the bill will strengthen the safety and soundness of our financial system by keeping our regulators up to date on the latest fintech innovation. So, I was glad to see that Act, the FUTURES Act move through the markup earlier this year. I certainly hope to see it come to a Floor vote soon. Chairman Powell, in your comments yesterday in the Senate, you said Basel III will need a, ``meaningful revamp.'' Before we proceed towards finalization of that rule, I was glad to hear you say that, considering that 97 percent of public comments on Basel III were negative, with 86 percent of that negative feedback coming from outside the banking sector. Many of my colleagues here today have highlighted their own concerns with Basel III. Given the pressure that Americans are already facing with inflation and increased interest rates and housing market stalls, I would urge that you take a good, long look at the cumulative effect of this rule in context with the broader economy, and our small and mid-sized banks, not just the larger financial institutions. Will a meaningful revamp include consideration of the hardships that overregulation causes for smaller financial institutions like those that are essential to rural communities like mine in southern Indiana? Mr. Powell. I think it will, yes. Mrs. Houchin. And are you concerned about the consolidation that we are seeing in the banking sector? I know you said it has been going on for 40 years. Does consolidation in the banking sector concern you? And are you concerned that the broader effect of cumulative rules is potentially leading to a further consolidation in the banking sector? Mr. Powell. Again, we don't want to be part of the reason for that consolidation. It seems to be happening, though, organically. We allowed interstate banking, for example. Also, I think for a long time, the learning was that there weren't a lot of economies of scale in banking. I think with all the technology costs, that old learning is now not really true. And I do think, in fact, a lot of the sort of smaller regionals do feel that they need to grow to be able to compete with the larger regionals. And also, the very largest banks are also present, as you well know, in many, many communities where they weren't 30 years ago. So, I think people are seeing a need for scale from a business standpoint. And we don't want to push consolidation. I think we also don't want to stand in the way of it, if that is what is necessary for banks to compete---- Mrs. Houchin. I appreciate that. Mr. Powell. ----with the largest banks. Mrs. Houchin. Thank you, Chairman Powell, again, for your testimony. Our financial system is really the envy of the world. We need to make sure that small and growing institutions have the tools they need to innovate without any undue burden. I appreciate your emphasis on that in the meaningful revamp. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I yield back. Mr. Williams of Texas. Next, the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Casten, who set a record for the mile run this morning in Washington, D.C., is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Casten. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You looked much better and well-quaffed when I saw you this morning than me. It's nice to see you again, Chair Powell. Just briefly, on the Basel III reforms, you and I have talked about the tax equity provisions and the fact that clean energy tax equity got a 4 times risk rating relative to other tax equity in the last version. If there is a reproposal, can you give us any visibility on whether clean energy tax equity will go back to the 100 percent risk rating that it has historically had? Mr. Powell. I am not going to give any specifics out today because the usual arrangement is that nothing is agreed upon until everything is agreed upon. So, I don't want to get into the specifics. I am hopeful that we--the three agencies--can come out pretty soon with the whole package. Mr. Casten. Okay. Well, the sooner, the better, even something temporary, because there are a lot of banks that want to participate that are, I think, more cautious than they need to be right now. I appreciate that. In 2021, I think you were a part of the FSOC report on climate-related financial risk that for the first time identified climate change as an emerging threat to U.S. financial stability. Do you still agree with that conclusion? Mr. Powell. The conclusion being what again? Mr. Casten. That climate change was an emerging threat to U.S. financial stability. Mr. Powell. Yes. Mr. Casten. Yes. I raise that because I have been troubled, as you know from some of the letters we have written, by this April Bloomberg report that said: number one, that Fed officials were pressuring the Basel Committee to make disclosure of banks' transition plans optional and that succeeded; number two, that the Fed, the OCC, and the FDIC were pushing to limit implementation of the Basel Committee's climate risk management principles to remove financed emissions; and number three, that the U.S., unlike other countries, did not propose that any of its banks be subject to an analysis of how they incorporated climate in their credit risk assessments. Have any representatives from your agency attempted to weaken the Basel Committee's work on climate risk, including by expressing concern about the Basel Committee overstepping its mandate with respect to its climate work? Mr. Powell. I guess I would say it this way: The Fed does not have a mandate of fostering an energy transition or dealing with climate change. Some of the Northern European banks feel that they do. They actually have that. It is in their mandate, either explicitly or implicitly. But we don't. Mr. Casten. But if we agree that climate change is an emerging threat to the stability of the banking system, are you saying you are not acting on it because you don't have the authority or you are not acting on it because you disagree with what you said in 2021? Mr. Powell. When you say it is an--and I agree. There is an emerging threat to the financial stability. That is over time. I think looking to the banking agencies to lead the fight on climate change is a big mistake. I think it is a job for elected people. We don't have that mandate in the United States. We can do a very limited thing, which is make sure that the institutions we supervise are aware of and can manage those risks. We are not going to be the ones who are forcing them to adopt plans to transition and that kind of thing. That is just not going to happen through the banking agencies without a law change. Mr. Casten. Then, if it is the view of the rest of the world that climate change is a financial risk and we are going to regulate our banks, is it the view of the Fed that the U.S. G-SIBs should not be required to report? Mr. Powell. Again, we are not going to be policymakers at the Fed. We are not going to do that. We don't have that mandate. A key to our independence is that we stick to the job you have given us. And the idea that we should discover climate and say, ``Okay, we are going to lead the fight on climate,''--if we are going to do things like that, we should be part of the Treasury Department. Mr. Casten. To be clear, no one is under the illusion that you are the EPA. But I spoke of with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen about this yesterday. We have multiple States where the insurance industry is collapsing. As you know well, something like a third to 40 percent of U.S. wealth is tied up in real estate. And, okay, U.S. homeowners are not G-SIBs, but in the 2008 financial crisis, we had risk that moved out of the G-SIBs onto other entities' balance sheets. And we said, ``Well, we are not responsible because it is an insurance company.'' Well, we fixed that. You do now have a mandate if there is systemic risk in the system. So the question is, if we know that risk is moving through the system, is the FSOC monitoring that risk? Or is it the FSOC's view that, if I am not allowed to look at it, I am not going to look at it, and it is somebody else's problem? Because somebody else is the person sitting here. Right? We are going be accountable when that risk comes--when those chickens come home to roost. Mr. Powell. The banks know their risks pretty well, and you see banks and the insurance companies pulling back from lending in coastal areas and things like that. Mr. Casten. No, I agree. But where are they off-loading that risk to? We have seen them putting it onto Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and we have seen Fannie and Freddie try to put it onto the reinsurance industry. Mr. Williams of Texas. The gentleman's time is up. Mr. Casten. The risk doesn't go away. Mr. Powell. We don't regulate them. Mr. Williams of Texas. The gentleman's time is up. Mr. Casten. I yield back. Mr. Williams of Texas. Next, the gentlewoman from the great State of Missouri, Congresswoman Wagner, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. Wagner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, in keeping with baseball analogies here, I think I am batting cleanup. Chairman Powell, welcome. In your testimony you stated that, ``Longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well-anchored.'' Could you please expand on that for us? Mr. Powell. Sure. In our thinking, and in the thinking of economists and central bankers, what the public expects about inflation is really important because if you expect there to be low inflation, then it probably will be low, because you are going to make sure that is true in your daily decisions. So, we measure them. We survey individuals and businesses and market participants. And then, we look at market-based--you can also derive market estimates of what inflation will be through various instruments in the market. And all of those suggest that people expect inflation to be right around 2 percent over the longer term, and that has been very stable right through this episode. Mrs. Wagner. When you say, ``longer term,'' sir, how many years would you be estimating? One year? Three years? Five years? Mr. Powell. We look at short- and medium-term inflation expectations, too, and they tend to be more volatile, because when inflation is high, people think that will last a few years. But one standard thing is to look at 5-year--which is between year 5 and year 10. That is a standard way to look--or longer term than that. If you just ask people in surveys over the longer term--you maybe don't specify--but they all give you the same answer, which is people kind of have faith that inflation will go back down to its 2-percent level. Mrs. Wagner. Thank you. There has been some reporting lately on, ``shrinkflation.'' And, for our viewers, I will say this is when you pay the same price for something as yesterday but get less of it than before, kind of like my bag of potato chips. Some have sought to direct attention away from the pain of runaway inflation that we have experienced and instead blame producers who themselves face rising costs pressures. Yet, I haven't seen any mention of shrinkflation as an inflation cause in any recent Monetary Policy Report. Moreover, a Bureau of Labor Statistics article last year looked at shrinkflation and concluded that, ``It has a miniscule impact on overall inflation.'' Chair Powell, from the Fed's perspective and analysis, has shrinkflation been a significant causal or amplifying factor in the runaway inflation of the past several years, that has imposed greater pain on American workers and households? Mr. Powell. I would have to say, no. I would say it this way. Packaging in the U.S. on food products and that kind of thing is going to disclose the contents of the thing. And the price will be what it is, and consumers can make their choice to buy it or not. But we don't think that is a major driver of inflation. Mrs. Wagner. I think from a producer standpoint, it probably is if the cost of the item is exponentially higher. Mr. Powell. It may reflect costs on the part of the producer. It probably does, but that doesn't mean it is a cause of inflation as such. Mrs. Wagner. Okay. Thank you. Switching topics, the Federal Reserve has produced volumes of research over the last decade highlighting the negative consequences of the debit interchange fee cap. Some of the economists who produced that research have even worked on this proposed rule, the Reg. II. Chair Powell, was the previous Federal Reserve research demonstrating Regulation II's detrimental impacts to low-cost checking accounts flawed, or did it have incorrect conclusions? And, if not, then why would the Fed propose this rulemaking when all of their research demonstrated detrimental impacts? Mr. Powell. I am not entirely sure what research you are referring to, but I will be happy to follow up with you on that. Mrs. Wagner. Yes, I hope you will, because I know we are having this discussion about the interchange fee caps and Reg. II. And I am concerned about going forward on that when much of the research that we have seen from the Fed over the last number of years says that it has quite detrimental impacts on low-cost checking accounts. So, if you wouldn't mind, I would love to get some answers on that. And, also, why hasn't the Fed taken into action the higher fraud costs that debit card issuers will incur as a result of the new dual-routing mandate for card-not-present transactions? I am over my time. If you could also answer that in writing, I would be ever so grateful. I yield back, sir. Mr. Williams of Texas. The gentlelady yields back. And I would like to thank Chairman Powell for his testimony today. I know you have to get out of here. The Chair notes that some Members may have additional questions for this witness, which they may wish to submit in writing. Without objection, the hearing record will remain open for 5 legislative days for Members to submit written questions to this witness and to place his responses in the record. Also, without objection, Members will have 5 legislative days to submit extraneous materials to the Chair for inclusion in the record. And I ask you, Chairman Powell, to please respond no later than August 30, 2024. With that in mind, this hearing is adjourned.  A P P E N D I X July 10, 2024
