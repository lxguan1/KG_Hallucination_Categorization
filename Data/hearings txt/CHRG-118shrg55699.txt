Good morning, everyone. The hearing of the Budget Committee will come to order. I always appreciate working with my distinguished Ranking Member, Senator Grassley, but I want to also recognize the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Ron Wyden, who is here because the topic today of finding savings in our bloated and disorganized healthcare system is one on which he has dedicated a lot of attention and interest in the Finance Committee, and the Finance Committee has the legislative authority. I can have hearings, but he writes bills, so I'm particularly grateful that Chairman Wyden is here today. I welcome our witnesses. Our hearing today will examine administrative costs in healthcare, how that cost harms patients and providers, and how much that increases federal healthcare costs overall. There's a lot of nonclinical work incidental to the actual delivery of care and much of it relates to getting paid. Our hearing last October spotlighted a dizzying web of administrative functions costing over $0.5 trillion per year. And of course, this is not just a matter of dollars and cents, even in the trillions, actual lives are at stake. One of my constituents, Deb from Cumberland, faced cruel insurance hurdles in the wake of a brain tumor diagnosis. She said, ``if fighting this disease wasn't enough to deal with, I and others are constantly fighting with insurance companies who are trying to deny every treatment path. For some reason, they feel that they know what's better for us than the medical community.'' For as long as I've served in the Senate, we've been discussing how to untangle this web of administrative cost burdens. As we worked on the Affordable Care Act (ACA), I highlighted how the broken economics of the healthcare system drove these administrative costs. The ACA made some strides in alleviating administrative burdens in the healthcare financial transaction ecosystem. Specifically, we set forth standard operating rules for electronic funds transfers and standardization of claims forms producing less friction in the exchange of information between providers and insurers and facilitating faster care delivery for patients, but there is much, much more to do. Billing and insurance related costs still total nearly $200 billion a year. The lack of standardization has been one major pain point. Different insurers apply different processes and rules to different providers, creating a web of confusion, driving up costs, and making doctors sometimes spend more time on administration than on providing actual care. The inconsistent paperwork required by different insurance companies makes it impossible to fully automate claims processing, resulting in thousands of lost hours filling out forms, raising costs, and sometimes delaying care. In some cases, the cost of chasing payment for services rendered exceeds the payment for those services. Yes, it sometimes makes more financial sense to just give up and provide the care without seeking payment. There are several layers to the billing costs problem, but they mostly all relate back to an antiquated and defective fee- for-service payment model. That's why my recent bipartisan primary care discussion draft establishes value-based payments at least for primary care, reducing reliance on fee-for-service payments and eliminating billing and associated administrative costs altogether for certain services. One particular scourge for patients is prior authorization: confusing, cumbersome, and inconsistent insurance rules that stop care while providers have to spend valuable time documenting and justifying the clinical need for a medicine or a service. In a value-based system, where doctors make their money by reducing costs and keeping patients healthier, there is no logic to prior authorization. So, I propose that companies and Medicare get prior authorization from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) before they're allowed to impose prior authorization on doctors practicing in successful Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). A 2022 Surgeon General Advisory Report links administrative burdens with healthcare burnout, with less clinician time with patients, and even with harm to patients. The Surgeon General specifically called on insurers to, and I'm quoting him here, ``reduce requirements for prior authorizations, streamline paperwork requirements, and develop simplified common billing forms.'' When the Surgeon General is focusing on administration, you know it's long pass time. My reform legislation will require the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, first, to identify the worst prior authorization practices in Medicare Advantage. Second, it requires CMS to set common standards for common prior authorization requirements across insurance plans. Third, it will lift the prior authorization burden completely off providers and Accountable Care Organizations with a proven track record of efficient patient care. No prior authorizations without prior authorization. I doubt insurers will be able to justify prior authorization for value-based providers whose incentives align with theirs. Providers may well have an incentive to run up their charges in a fee-for-service model, but running up charges is self-defeating for ACOs. In today's hearing, we'll discuss these and other solutions. We'll hear from health economist David Cutler how administrative costs in the U.S. are far higher than in other countries and where savings can be found in the healthcare financial transaction ecosystems. We'll hear from Rhode Island's Noah Benedict, who leads one of our state's highest preforming primary care practices, the Integra ACO, which, by the way, is a national as well as a Rhode Island leader, on how administrative burdens hurt his ACO patients. As I have said many times during hearings of this Committee, my focus is clear. Let's work on serious proposals that reduce healthcare spending with no, none, zero, benefit cuts. Such proposals are good for patients, good for doctors, and good for the budget. As I turn to my Ranking Member, I'd like to thank Senator Grassley and his team for showing up at my healthcare savings office hours with several very helpful and promising ideas and suggestions. Senator Grassley, I look forward to working with you. The floor is yours. Senator Grassley. We had a pretty quiet meeting that day, didn't we? Chairman Whitehouse. Well, it was just us kids, but it was a good meeting. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR GRASSLEY \2\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \2\ Prepared statement of Senator Grassley appears in the appendix on page 26. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Senator Grassley. I want to thank you for following through on this hearing today, and reducing administrative burdens in healthcare is a very important and top priority issue. Our country spends more than $4.5 trillion annually on healthcare. Our spending has more than tripled as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) since 1960. Growing healthcare costs don't just strain American's pocketbooks. These healthcare costs also are a major driver of widening budget deficits in the Federal Government's unsustainable fiscal outlook and we're not getting our money's worth for all of our spending. Major healthcare program spending eats up 32 percent of the federal revenue today and it will be 44 percent by mid-Century. Our healthcare system has plenty of waste and inefficiency and these ought to be fixed. As I've stated in our previous healthcare-related hearings, we should begin by increasing transparency, competition, fighting fraud, and cutting red tape. Federal regulations are often too burdensome for physicians and healthcare providers. We should promote innovation and competition under Medicare and lessen the focus on central planning. Since 2021, federal agencies have imposed over 90 regulations on the healthcare industries, costing taxpayers and providers over $100 billion. These regulations create 10 million hours of paperwork, hours that could be better spent providing care to patients. This is the opposite of reducing the administrative burden. I'm glad that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently took action to improve the timeliness of prior authorizations for seniors that are on Medicare Advantage. I hope this lessens the burdens on providers and improves access for patients. I support putting more sunshine on prior authorizations. CMS should be aggressively auditing Medicaid Advantage prior authorization activities so that we have a clearer understanding how the patient, providers, and taxpayers are impacted. Some administrative functions serve an important purpose in preventing unnecessary healthcare spending. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and CMS across multiple presidential administrations have created and agreed that transparency and efficient prior authorization plays an important role in combating waste, fraud, and abuse. Cutting down on $103 billion of improper payments for major healthcare programs would be an effective way to lower healthcare spending as well. I'm the author of major and more recent updates to the Federal Government's most powerful tool in fighting fraud and that tool is the False Claims Act. Since the enactment of these reforms, the Federal Government has recovered more than $75 billion lost in fraud and actually saved billions more by deterring would be fraudsters. In 2023, there was more than $2.7 billion in false claim settlements and judgments with $1.8 billion of that $2.7 billion involving healthcare industry. Now, we all know that whistleblowers are very responsible for helping recovery nearly all of this money that's been recovered. The Justice Department and CMS needs to be more aggressively going after healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse. We can reduce administrative burdens in healthcare for providers and patients without compromising access to high-quality care. We can get there by reducing regulations while maintaining guardrails to protect patients, centers, safety, and quality through greater competition and transparency in our healthcare systems will help to bring down costs and lessen administrative burdens. Healthcare spending can be made more efficient without compromising the quality of care or reducing access, especially in rural America. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today on ways that we can reduce administrative burden in healthcare for patients and providers while lowering taxpayers' costs. Finally, I want to comment on a recent Medicare Trustees Report. Medicare is part of America's social fabric and for decades it has provided seniors with disabilities access to routine and lifesaving care at their local hospitals, doctor's office, and pharmacy. For the eighth year in a row, the Trustees have issued a funding warning because Medicare outlays are expected to exceed its dedicated revenue by 45 percent. Republicans want to preserve and strengthen this program for future generations. The only way to make these critical programs sustainable is to follow the Ronald Regan, Tip O'Neil model of 1983. That means that Congress and the President working in a bipartisan fashion is what it takes to get the job done. I'm proud to have led the effort in 2003 to modernize Medicare by establishing the prescription drug benefit Part D. In the first decade of Medicare Part D, the Federal Government spent 36 percent less than projected, while improving access to prescription drugs for millions of seniors. That effort required bipartisan cooperation from both chambers and presidential leadership and is a prime example of what we need to do to address Medicare's fiscal challenge. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you very much. We'll turn to the witnesses now. We'll first hear from Professor David Cutler, the Otto Eckstein Professor of Applied Economics at the Harvard Department of Economics with secondary appointments to the Kennedy School and the School of Public Health. He's also a member of the National Academy of Medicine. He's researched and written about the costs of medical care, including administrative costs and advises businesses, governments, and healthcare providers. We'll hear then from Noah Benedict. Mr. Bendict is the President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Rhode Island Primary Care Physicians Corporation, the largest multispecialty Independent Practice Association in Rhode Island, representing 168 primary care providers and over 300 specialty providers. Rhode Island Primary Care manages care for over 200,000 lives and stands at the forefront of healthcare delivery in our region. Mr. Benedict is also one of the principal architects of and serves as Vice Chair on the Board of Integra, one of Rhode Island's highest performing ACOs. We've heard regularly from them in various committees. His rival at Coastal Medical, Al Kuros, has been a frequent witness and the competition between Integra and Coastal has been for national preeminence, not just local preeminence. Mr. Benedict also serves on the boards of the Care Transformation Collaborative of Rhode Island, the Kodak Behavioral Healthcare Groups of South County Health, The Rhode Island Quality Institute, and Horizon Healthcare Partners. Our final witness will be Dr. Anthony DiGiorgio. Dr. DiGiorgio is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). He cares for patients with traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries. He's also Director of Spinal Neuron at the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center, a county-run safety net hospital. Gentlemen, each of your full statements will be made a part of the record without objection. You have 5 minutes and I'll give notice at the conclusion of our testimony. I'm swapping my spot to ask questions with Chairman Wyden. He has other business to get to, so the order will be Wyden, Grassley, Whitehouse, not Whitehouse, Grassley, Wyden. Please proceed, Dr. Cutler. STATEMENT OF DR. DAVID CUTLER, OTTO ECKSTEIN PROFESSOR OF APPLIED ECONOMICS, HARVARD UNIVERSITY \3\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \3\ Prepared statement of Dr. Cutler appears in the appendix on page 29. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dr. Cutler. Chairman Whitehouse, Ranking Member Grassley, and members of the Senate Budget Committee, thank you for holding this hearing today and inviting me to testify. It's an honor for me to do so. My name is David Cutler. I'm Professor of Economics at Harvard University, where I've been engaged in research and teaching about health economics for over 30 years. A good part of my research involves understanding the administrative costs of healthcare. In my testimony today, I wish to make four points. First, administrative costs contribute significantly to overall healthcare spending. In my research, I estimate that administrative costs are nearly $1 trillion annually or roughly one quarter of medical spending. That's far higher than other countries and dwarfs the amount that the U.S. spends on caring for people with cardiovascular disease or cancer. Second, federal spending on healthcare would fall significantly if we could reduce administrative costs. Broadly speaking, administrative costs affect the federal budget in three ways: through higher Medicare and Medicaid spending, through greater costs of subsidy programs such as the tax exclusion of employer provided health insurance and premiums in the ACA's exchanges, and through higher spending on healthcare for federal employees, both civilian and military. I've estimated the cost savings to the U.S. Treasury of reducing administrative costs using known technologies. I estimate that application of known technologies to healthcare could reduce administrative costs by 7 percent. If these savings were to be realized in all three of these areas, as I believe they could, the results would be as shown in Exhibit 2 of my testimony. Which is that savings would be $130 billion in 2023 alone. This amounts to 2 percent of the total federal spending in that year and a 0.5 percent of GDP. Third, there are range of ways in which the federal government can help to reduce administrative costs. The most important area is what the Chairman mentioned, which is in the financial transaction's ecosystem, which is basically the cost of billing approvals, prior authorization, and similar activities. The issues here involve standardization and computerization. Just to take an example, when we go to a grocery store every product has a Universal Product Code (UPC). That's the bar that gets scanned. And the code is the same at all stores so that firms only need to produce one set of packaging, regardless of where they sell their goods. That reduces the cost of selling and buying goods enormously. The price of good can vary across stores. The service of the good can vary, but the bar code does not. The healthcare industry is the equivalent of every store having its own bar code. It's incredibly inefficient. It requires enormous expenditures on all sides of things. The reason this persists is because no large organization has indicated that standardization is essential and laid out the foundations for doing so. There are several steps that are needed. Examples include standardization of information transition, removing prior authorization for good actors, which the Chairman mentioned in his opening statement, and doing a spring cleaning of sorts to get rid of requirements that once might have been appropriate, but no longer are. In retail, that is with the UPC codes, the standardization was done by supermarkets. In banking, where we transfer upwards of $50 trillion a year at very low expense, the standardization was done by the Federal Reserve. Nobody has done it yet in healthcare. I believe the Federal Government is the only organization that will be able to do this. This brings me to my fourth point, which is that now is the ideal time for the Federal Government to get involved. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and federal rules about not blocking information transfers provide a way to carry out administrative simplification. Insurers are already looking to invest in AI to do this. Most of them have some AI programs ongoing, but they're using it for internal purposes only. That is, for thinking internally about how they go about doing things. They're not thinking about the ecosystem involving the providers and the payers and everyone involved. Providers would like to do the same. They would like to use AI technology, but they don't know how. Providing guidance and leadership now could help the Federal Government save tremendous amounts of funds, and as both the Chairman and Ranking Member said, improve the quality of healthcare at the same time. Thank you for your consideration of these points and I look forward to any questions you might have. Chairman Whitehouse. Thanks, Dr. Cutler. Mr. Benedict. STATEMENT OF NOAH BENEDICT, PRESIDENT AND CEO, RHODE ISLAND PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS CORPORATION \4\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \4\ Prepared statement of Mr. Benedict appears in the appendix on page 42. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mr. Benedict. Chairman Whitehouse, Ranking Member Grassley, and members of the Senate Budget Committee, thank you for this opportunity to testify before you today. My name is Noah Benedict. I am the President/CEO of Rhode Island Primary Care Physicians Corporation, an independent practice association that represents 168 primary care providers and manages the care for over 200,000 Rhode Islanders. I'm here to testify about a matter of utmost importance: the impact of administrative burdens on providers and patient care. If left unaddressed, this issue will continue to challenge our healthcare system, adversely impacting the costs, and more importantly, quality of the care we deliver. Our providers eagerly anticipated my visit to Washington, hoping that this would shed light on the significant challenges posed by the administrative burdens implemented by the payers. Unfortunately, preapproval or prior authorization by insurers often postpone or interrupt medical services and decisions. These delays can be associated with poor patient outcomes. While the intent of prior authorization is to reduce the amount of ineffective care provided, they add administrative burden in unreimbursed costs to physician offices and also appear to be increasing over time, which is a troubling trend. Any activities that distract providers from focusing on patient care risks adverse outcomes. I included the results of the American Medical Association Provider Survey on prior authorizations in my written testimony, but I thought it would be more powerful to share the survey results from our Rhode Island primary care provider group. Seventy-three percent of providers reported an average wait time for a prior authorization to be at least 2 days. Of the 73 percent, 78 percent of providers reported an average wait time for a prior authorization to be at least 3 to 5 days. Thirty- one percent of providers report that for patients whose treatment requires prior authorization, the process often leads to patients abandoning their recommended course of treatment. Fifty-one percent of providers report prior authorizations often delay access to necessary care. Of those 51 percent, 27 percent of providers report prior authorizations always delay access to necessary care. Sixty-two percent of providers report that prior authorizations have a significant negative impact on those patients whose treatment requires prior authorizations, potentially leading to compromised health outcomes, and 97 percent of our providers describe the burden associated with prior authorizations as high or extremely high, indicating that this is a pressing issue that requires attention. And lastly, 91 percent of providers report that in the past 5 years prior authorizations have increased significantly. The chorus from the provider community is firmly aligned on the heavy burdens related to prior authorizations. Given the data, there's no mistaking the impact this has on the effectiveness of our care delivery system in its role in heightening provider frustration, which invariably leads to burnout. This is especially alarming, given the fragility of post-pandemic provider workforce. COVID-19 had a profound effect on our healthcare system. It presented a stress test for the service delivery and fast-track to provider burnout. The American Medical Association (AMA) reports that nearly 63 percent of physicians are reporting signs of burnout. The factors driving this exhaustion are system inefficiencies, increased regulations, technology requirements, and administrative burdens. Three of the aforementioned factors, namely, system inefficiencies, increased regulation, and administrative burdens can be associated with prior authorizations and there are cost considerations as well. A review of relevant studies indicates that at least half of the total administrative spending is likely ineffective and wasteful, ranging between 7.5 and 15 percent of national heath spending or 285 to 570 billion in 2019 alone. And with primary care, on average, each provider requires 0.2 FTE support daily. That's 8 hours a week to manage prior authorizations. That equates to over $12,000 per year per provider and roughly $2.1 million to support the administrative lift for 168 primary care providers. Most importantly, there are adverse outcomes associated with administrative burdens. Inhaled corticosteroids, known as ICS, are vital to managing asthma, but become problematic when subjected to prior authorization mandates, leading to asthma exacerbations and hospitalizations. Providers estimates that two to three exacerbations monthly stems from lapses in ICS use often due to formulary changes or prior authorization delays. Patients unaware of the delayed authorization's impact may initially feel well only to experience exacerbations and subsequent hospitalizations once the medication has fully left their system. This cycle emblematic of broader patient safety concerns underscores the urgency for intervention. At Rhode Island Primary Care, this issue illustrates the diversion of clinical services, notably for pharmacists in this example, a way for essential patient care tasks. Daily prior authorizations and medication denials detract from medication titration responsibilities, provider education support, and cost- effective therapeutic exploration. The associated pharmacist's costs reach $23,000 annually per provider and a whopping $3.8 million for all 168 primary care providers, representing a substantial diversion from potential clinical investment traditionally yielding a 3.5 to 1 return on that investment. While there isn't a single solution to address this intricate problem, one approach is to consider a greater proliferation of value-based payment models. Opportunities exists for policymakers and payers to continue introducing new provider payment models to facilitate administrative simplification. Value-based care correlates the amount of healthcare providers earn for their services to the outcomes they deliver for their patients as compared to fee-for-service which rewards volume. Value-based care principles---- Chairman Whitehouse. Mr. Benedict, you're over your 5 minutes, if you could wrap up quickly. Thank you. Mr. Benedict: The adoption of globally capitated payment models and the global capitation payment it's relatively simpler transaction involving less administrative burden for both payers and providers as compared to fee-for-service payment. With the appropriate quality and compliance guardrails in place, payers can simplify the transactional costs that accompany the care provided by their medical providers with the introduction of new payment models over time payers can reward high-quality, cost-efficient providers with a streamlined, less costly administrative burden. I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this impactful issue and would be available for any questions the senators have. Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you. Dr. DiGiorgio. STATEMENT OF DR. ANTHONY DIGIORGIO, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO \5\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \5\ Prepared statement of Dr. DiGiorgio appears in the appendix on page 49. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dr. DiGiorgio. Thank you. Chairman Whitehouse, Ranking Member Grassley, and members of the Committee, I'm Anthony DiGiorgio, Assistant Professor of Neurological Surgery and Affiliated Faculty at the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California, San Francisco. I'm honored to testify today before the Committee on administrative burdens on healthcare, a topic about which I'm very passionate and I applaud the Committee for addressing this important issue. Today I'm here in my personal capacity and the views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of UCSF, its Department of Neurological Surgery, or Institute for Health Policy Studies, or the Mercatus Center. In my testimony today, I'll focus on the increasing administrative burdens on clinicians and the role of CMS regulations and electronic health record mandates. As a frontline physician surgeon in a safety net hospital, I feel the crushing weight of administrative burdens daily. While there are some burdens from the commercial plans admittedly, I want to focus on those that are largely driven by access federal regulation that neither enhances the delivery or quality of care nor patient safety. In the past two decades, there have been no gains in efficiency for U.S. healthcare, demonstrated by the lack of labor productivity growth according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics. Furthermore, growth in a number of a administrators has outpaced physician growth by over 20 to 1. These administrators haven't improved healthcare delivery, rather they're employed to navigate increasingly intricate government regulations which create unnecessary complexity in care delivery. The bureaucratic burdens from these poorly designed systems and ineffective regulatory policies are inevitably placed on frontline clinicians like me, eroding the time I and my colleagues can devote to clinical care and ultimately leading to an exit from the practice of medicine due to burnout, which is an existential threat to the healthcare workforce. While every industry faces burnout, nearly two-thirds of doctors show symptoms, a substantially higher rate than their peers in non- healthcare industries. Even medical students see the regulatory burdens devalue patient care. A recent survey shows that 61 percent of U.S. med students don't plan on practicing clinical medicine. Central planning is exemplified in Medicare's rules regulating quality metrics and billing trade outsized documentation burdens. This, coupled with cumbersome electronic medical records explain why healthcare labor productivity has been stagnant since the dawn of the information age. The current quality metrics regime has added to this burden. CMS has over 2,000 metrics in its inventory and independent physician practices spend $15 billion a year on metric reporting while hospital employ armies of coders to report metrics and massage the numbers. Quality metrics don't just increase costs, they can harm patients. For example, the hospital readmission reduction program is associated with decreased readmissions, as expected, but also with increased mortality. Quality metrics also disproportionately penalize safety net hospitals, such as my own, because of inadequate risk adjustment for socioeconomic status. There's a greater return on investment and simply gaming the numbers than on improving quality. Having patients seem sicker at baseline increases hospital revenues, both by capturing more complexity for increased diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment and by improving relative quality metrics. The burden of documenting this falls on the frontline clinicians who are hounded by administrators to make patients seem as sick as possibly according to specific criteria, again, which are set by CMS. One study shows a greater than 40 percent increase in average margin by simply having billing staff round with physicians, directing them on what to put into our clinical notes. Clinicians are beholden to documentation requirements that satisfy Medicare billing regulations. There are over 11,000 billing codes. CMS is currently responsible for regulatory minutia on these codes. Their arbitrary documentation requirements add to the administrative burden. As a surgeon, I was unsurprised with the study that showed trauma surgeons spend 73 full 24-hour days in 1 year of work to complete the documentation required to satisfy Medicare billing requirements. The electronic medical records, or EMRs, make matters worse. These inefficient systems tether physicians to their computers. One time motion study found that physicians spend 2 hours on the computer for every hour of patient time. We did a study of our own at UCSF and found the neurosurgery residents spend 20 hours of their overnight call shift logged into the computer. As doctors, we feel relief like we can focus on clinical care again if the EMR goes down. What does it say about a technology that its failure improves service delivery? The advent of EMR mail out clinicians to access their medical records remotely, but that is transformed into an environment where it's expected that physicians be constantly attached to their computer. Much of this is due to CMS's meaningful use mandate of computerized physician order entry and order reconciliation, along with regulations like the appropriate use criteria, which just adds meaningless clicks to our workflow. All of this relegates the physician to an order entry clerk, completing cumbersome tasks in the EMR which could be performed by a medical assistant. We physicians feel the strain with our nursing colleagues, who must hunt us down for trivial orders that they, as licensed healthcare professors, are also more than qualified to enter. These constant interruptions and superfluous warning messages generated by the EMR also lead to distracted clinicians, alarm fatigue, and more near-miss events. The answers to these burdens is not more top-down regulation. It lies with fostering a competitive, dynamic marketplace which values efficiency and quality. Ultimately, it's time to give the market a chance to drive meaningful change in healthcare delivery, allowing frontline physicians to focus on what matters most, providing quality care to patients without the suffocating weight of unnecessary administrative burdens. Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you very much. Chairman Wyden. STATEMENT OF SENATOR WYDEN Senator Wyden. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Congratulations to you in putting together the National Basketball Association (NBA) all stars for us today in this field of looking at administrative inefficiency. And let me start this way. We're going to spend that $4.5 trillion this year on American healthcare. There are 330 million of us. You divide 330 million into $4.5 trillion and you could send every family of 4 in America a check for $50,000 and say, here, get your healthcare. So, the three of you have really helped us to get into some of the details, and let me start this way. Mr. Benedict, as I listened to your testimony, what you did is basically unravel the insurance company argument for prior authorization. What the insurance companies so often say to all of us is that authorizations are supposed to help patients get better care. And what you've said is based on your analysis and your work as it relates to the asthma medicines, the inhalers, people get worse care. So, this is really a key area for us to look at. And I guess my first question to the three of you, are there other areas that you think we should, under the leadership of the Chairman and Senator Grassley, in a bipartisan way, are there other areas where you believe we should look at the prior authorization issue in terms of patients getting worse care rather than better care as the insurance companies claim, other areas, if possible. Mr. Benedict. From my perspective, there should be greater coordination for the policies and the processes for prior authorization. That would streamline the process. You would better understand exactly what was expected and the turnaround time would improve. On top of that, I would have the payers publicly document statistics around that to ensure that they're expediting what would be these preauthorization denials and at what rate that they are denying. So, to whatever extent you could go into the details to help the market better understand where the bottlenecks are that are coming between the provider and patient care would be very helpful. Senator Wyden. Other examples? Dr. Cutler. Dr. Cutler. Yes. Maybe just step back a tiny bit. The typical payer has a few thousand prior authorization codes. Call it 4,000-5,000 prior authorization codes. Roughly half are on the medical care side and half are on the pharmaceutical side. Most of those sort of came about haphazardly. Like, for example, once upon a time, it was appropriate to do prior authorization on antihypertensive medications and so the legacy of those are still around, but at this point every single medication is generic, so there's no benefit to doing that. And there is, as Mr. Benedict was saying, enormous costs. In a rough guess, working with some colleagues, my guess is about half of the prior authorization codes, a couple thousand for a typical insurer, are serving no useful medical purpose. They're a legacy of when we wanted to make sure that people were using the generic drug instead of the branded drug and now the branded drug doesn't even exist. Senator Wyden. Let's do this, Dr. Cutler, and to all of you. This is very helpful. And if you could just give us a list of other areas, medicines and the like, which would fit Mr. Benedict's example, I think that would be very helpful. One last question. Dr. Cutler, I like very much what you're talking about with respect to standardizing these prior authorizations. And my question to you here, because we've talked about these kinds of things over the years, is about the next step. Because obviously people are going to say, hey, this is a big deal under the Chairman and Senator Grassley, you guys going to figure it out, but it's not like flicking on a light switch. We're going to have to take the next step. In your view, and your scholarship, Dr. Cutler, what would be the next step for all of us here who want to deal with the prior authorization issue through the standardization you recommend? Dr. Cutler. It's going to be a process and not a single piece of legislation. So, it's going to be a process to start off and say, first, remove the prior authorization where it's not appropriate, where the providers are already bearing the risk. Second is do the spring cleaning. That is, work together to get rid of the stuff that's no longer valuable. Third, think about situations particularly where CMS and private payers are requiring people to go through records, human beings to go through records where we can gather all the information electronically and say let's just move towards an electronic submission rather than--fourth is to continue to expand the payment models so that we're not paid for just documenting, but we're paid for actually doing a better job. Senator Wyden. I'm over my time. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. An important hearing. Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you. Senator Grassley. Senator Grassley. I'm going to ask all my questions for Dr. DiGiorgio. Your testimony talks about the weight of daily administrative burdens put on doctors and frontline healthcare workers. What's the source of these administrative burdens? Can you give an example of a top-down regulation the Federal Government should remove today that wouldn't compromise patients' safety or quality? Dr. DiGiorgio. I think, broadly speaking, what I'd really like to see is a shift from CMS being a plan provider to being a plan regulator. I think CMS is largely focused on the minutia of the fee schedule and unburdening CMS from that would allow it to focus more on things like the adequate risk adjustment model and population health quality control. And specifically, I'd love to see CMS go on a quality diet. I'd like it to install a living system of quality metrics where metrics are retired as they're shown to no longer be useful and new metrics can come into place that would instead of focusing on the frontline clinicians and how we practice care, focus more on larger hospital systems and hospital practices, helping to improve the clinician experience. I think we need to make sure that any new quality metrics are easily collected using existing technology and that we're not adding additional administrative burden for data collection for these metrics. Senator Grassley. You describe the importance of fostering competitive dynamic healthcare marketplace that values efficiency and quality. Is Medicare Advantage a marketplace where we can foster competition to address administrative burden problems in our healthcare system, and if so, what can we do to make it more competitive? Dr. DiGiorgio. Yes. I think absolutely Medicare Advantage is a space that could foster competition, but there has to be a lot more competition. If we're talking about inefficient prior authorizations, we shouldn't need to regulate efficiency in the health plans if there is adequate competition. So, I think we need to improve competition with more plans entering the space. And in addition, I'd like to see equalization between Medicare fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage with a unified quality reporting system and star rating system between the two types of Medicare. Senator Grassley. Your testimony stated employment growth of healthcare administrators outpacing growth in the number of new doctors by over 20 to 1 in recent years. What are these administrators doing in the healthcare system, who are they, and why haven't they returned value to our healthcare system and decreased spending? Dr. DiGiorgio. Largely, what Dr. Cutler mentioned, is they are taking all the unstructured data that physicians are putting into our clinical documentation and attempting to make it structured data to fit into certain billing codes and quality metric formula. A lot of that could be automated, I believe, using again existing technology. But really, CMS creates sort of a floor of the documentation burden. So, if CMS says that a certain Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code or billing code requires XYZ, then physicians are going to be encouraged to put XYZ in every single one of our notes to try to get that billing code. And again, all these administrators go through our notes, try to maximize which code can be assigned to each instance of clinical documentation and put that in, and bill it regardless of the payer. Senator Grassley. My last question, your testimony spoke to the lack of labor productivity gains in healthcare over recent decades. In other words, doctors haven't become more efficient, even with new technology like electronic medical records. How should we approach regulating Artificial Intelligence, given the impact of top-down regulations on current technology? Dr. DiGiorgio. Yes, I think AI has huge potential to do a lot of that administrative work. Again, taking unstructured data and creating structured data out of it. I am worried that we would over regulate it. If I went back to 1990 and told all physicians that we're going to computerize paper charts and have instant access to data and imaging, I think everyone would be thrilled with the amount of efficiency gains we would have with that technology. That never happened because we over regulated EMR with things like meaningful use. And so, I am worried that we would take the same approach to AI and take away any potential efficiency gains with over regulation. Senator Grassley. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Whitehouse. Thanks very much. It seems to me that you all seem to agree that there are too many quality measures and that heads are nodding yes. And that that creates a lot of noise and not so much signal. I'm not going to ask you now because it would take a lot of time, but I would ask you as a question for the record to consider how we should work through the reduction of excess quality measures, given that they come from so many different sources. Sometimes it's the hospital itself, sometimes if it's a county hospital, it's the county. If it's a state hospital, it's the state. Even if it's not a state hospital, it's the state health department. There are several federal entities. And to stop all of it and provide some order to the chaos is a complex administrative task, so I'd like your advice on that. And in addition, if you're going to strip down to simple, signal effective, quality reporting, you've got to figure out who makes the choice and who is to be trusted. So, if you could also let me know who you think the best agency is who would be the overseer of the quality measures spring cleaning. Onto prior authorization, I think the spring cleaning issue that half of them are of no use is important for us to address. I think the reporting on which the insurance companies are using prior authorization to delay payment for cashflow purposes and unfortunately to delay treatment in the process of delaying payment, so reporting on the timeliness of prior authorization clearances, I think, is a terrific idea. And in other cases, it seems the prior authorizations aren't needed at all. And I'd like to ask Mr. Benedict to comment on when you have an ACO and when providers are being paid or not paid, depending on the efficiency in which they deliver care and the quality of the outcomes that they're delivering, what does that do to the incentive to overcharge or upcharge or add procedures just for the sake of running up the billing score, which presumably is what prior authorization is intended to defend against. But it seems that with an ACO, you're defending against a nonexistent problem. Mr. Benedict. It's in the best interest for an ACO to most proficiently provide the highest quality care based upon the payment mechanism. As you all know, value-based approach to medicine changes behavior. Specifically, in the world that we live in with fee-for-service only being the driver for how revenue is brought into a particular organization or practice, you will find that there will be more erroneous tests that are ordered because they can and there is really no consequence to it. Now, I'm not saying they're doing it because they want to run the bill up, but if you look at the data, more tests are ordered because there is not accountability; hence, accountable care organization. When you're accountable, not just for the quality, which is most important, but the financial component of how you operate within your office and you treat your patients you are mindful in ways about what you should do most efficiently, and you consider paths you might otherwise not if you were in a fee-for-service world. And we saw that firsthand as we made the transition from fee-for-service doctors into Accountable Care Organization doctors. It was palpable. Chairman Whitehouse. Let me stop you on that particular point because as you made the transition from a fee-for-service model to a value-based model, you nevertheless still had to keep track of the whole fee-for-service system and that's still the case. Mr. Benedict. That is still the case. Chairman Whitehouse. Would it be better, Dr. Cutler, if we moved to a more robust hybrid payment model so that the tracking through fee-for-service could be lifted in addition to the billing through fee-for-service? Dr. Cutler. Absolutely. In many cases, there's no reason to do that tracking because they're the ones who are bearing the risk and so documenting all of it that way is really just a waste. Chairman Whitehouse. And I was interested in the comments that I think you all seem to agree on about cleaning up electronic medical records. Mr. Benedict serves on the Board of Rhode Island Quality Institute, which is a group that I founded years ago as Attorney General in the wake of the crossing the quality chasm into errors, human reports and all of that, and we focused a lot on first health information technology, then health information exchange, and we've been pretty robust in all of that. So, it's disappointing for me to hear that that technology is now the vector for more trouble than it's worth. And I was struck by Dr. DiGiorgio's comment that his clinical care improves when the EMR system goes down. So, my time is up, but I would very much appreciate it, if in the same way, you'll do a written response by a question for the record (QFR) on the question of how we negotiate the super abundance of quality measures problem with any advice you have on trying to figure out how we solve the problem of the health information exchange, which was intended to be a beautiful thing. Thank you. With that, Senator Johnson is next up, then Senator Kaine, then Senator Marshall. STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHNSON Senator Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate this hearing. Again, it's similar to others we've had where, you know, we're talking about putting a band aid on a dying patient. And so, I want to talk a little bit about the root cause. You know, Dr. Cutler is an economist. What would happen if let's say buying a car was an entitlement and there were no regulations on what kind of car you would buy, what would the American people do? They'd go out and buy the most expensive car possible, right? Dr. Cutler. Very expensive cars. Senator Johnson. So, you'd end up having them put regulations. You know if you want this kind of truck. That's what's happened in healthcare. You know, Mister or Doctor-- whatever, Doctor. Sorry. I'm terrible at that. You mentioned excess federal regulation. You said regulatory burdens, Medicare billing requirements, CMS creates a floor. We need increased competition and none of the things we're talking about increases competition. None of the things we're talking about actually reduces regulation. So, the root cause of all of this is a third-party payer system. Mr. Benedict, why do independent physicians need to associate with your association? Why do they think they need that? Mr. Benedict. Without the scaffolding, we can provide around them that helps them ease the administrative burden. Senator Johnson. You wouldn't be necessary if it weren't for all these administrative burdens caused by the third-party payer system really driven by government-run healthcare. So, as long as we've got this massive government-run healthcare third- party payer system that--I mean you're not going to change government. I mean, you can talk about fee-for-service going to a value-based model. Again, those are just buzz words. It's not going to reduce the regulatory burden just like Diagnostic Medical Sonography (DMS) didn't really fix the paper burden. It made it worse, or I assume it didn't make any improvements. So, why are we talking about transitioning to something that actually would increase regulation? You know, why are we talking about high deductible insurance plans to cover the catastrophic events and then bring consumers back into the process? I mean, isn't that the real solution? Dr. Cutler, what other area of our economy are people participating in that part burning out because of administrative burdens? Not that there aren't administrative burdens in other areas of our economy, but this is kind of unique to healthcare, right? Dr. Cutler. It is unique to healthcare. It's also the case, while I share many of your sentiments, unfortunately, many people don't use their high deductible health plan in the appropriate way either. Senator Johnson. Because we don't require them to. You know, in any healthcare plans, you know, the only deductibles ever paid is like a $10 copay. So again, people don't really care about the cost of drugs. I mean, again, we have taken the benefit of free market competition out of healthcare and that's the problem we're dealing with. So, again, anything else we're talking about here literally is putting a band aid on a dying patient. I'd like to revive the patient. So, I've seen a lot of heads agreeing with me. Dr. Cutler. I would say the only caveat there would be you could globally attack this issue with value-based approached to contracting; namely, global capitation and risk. Because then you actually change behavior. There is responsibility for the cost associated with the care delivered. Senator Johnson. Well, wouldn't you be better off with independent physicians doing that themselves or a lot more different insurance companies where you actually had true competition. You know, Mr. Benedict, you mentioned the word ``the market.'' Where is there a market in healthcare truthfully? Mr. Benedict. It's local. Senator Johnson. It doesn't really exist. I mean, we have a complete failure of a marketplace here. We've got government control, by and large, setting the terms for how the insurance companies operate and the only thing they've come up with in terms of restraining costs are pre-certifications. And we see the damage done by that, but what else is there to control costs? So, you're suggesting doing away with that. You know, then Katy bar the door in terms of runaway costs. I mean, what is the current dollar value in terms of how much more Americans spend for healthcare versus other countries in the world, at least double, right? Mr. Benedict. Multiples more. Senator Johnson. So, it's completely broken. So again, why aren't we looking at the root cause of this as opposed to, again, these buzz word solutions that I just don't think would actually work. I mean, I know it's an attempt within the system that's probably going to be impossible to change. Mr. Benedict. I would only retort that's really tearing out the entire chassis and that may be necessary, but along the way for us to control those costs there are opportunities for us. Senator Johnson. One final point, in Wisconsin, I think this is occurring. There are doctors who are just dropping out of the system. Not taking Medicare and Medicaid patients and just literally charging cash. It's unbelievable how, first of all, cost effective it is. Like $55 for a half-hour visit and the doctors love it. I think we ought to start figuring out a way to transition that were doctors are at the top of the treatment pyramid rather than being crushed at the very bottom and become independent again like it was only a few decades ago. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Whitehouse. Senator Kaine. STATEMENT OF SENATOR KAINE Senator Kaine. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Johnson started off and said that the problem was the third-party payer system. I thought he was going to go full Bernie on me there for a minute. I was intrigued with the opening. This is a great hearing and great witnesses, so just a couple questions. So, Dr. Cutler, your chart, which I was intrigued by, so you believe just implementing, you know, basic technology reforms, efficiencies and improvements could save us about $130 billion a year and that's just administrative improvements. Senator Marshall and I are on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee together, and he and I have been working really hard on pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) reform. We've got a good PBM reform bill out of the Committee on the floor of the Senate. I think it was with an 18 to 3 vote. We're waiting for, hopefully, getting some floor time on that. That's a big saver too and that's not necessarily administrative, but it's just going at a piece of the system in this weird complexity that we have where we've got a middleman sucking up huge profits who do no research and produce nothing. I mean, they were designed, I guess, to try to control somewhat what pharmaceuticals people were getting. And instead, they often are blocking access to lower cost pharmaceuticals because they collect a percentage price of what they're providing to patients. And so, if it's $130 billion we could save just by dealing with administrative efficiencies, Dr. Cutler, do you do any kind of work on kind of what are the just excess slosh and profit is that if we were a little more efficient and took that out what we might save? Dr. Cutler. So, I think, as a whole, the country could save close to half of medical spending. Let's call it between a third and a half of medical spending, which I think as we were talking about earlier, would be, you know, enough for tens of thousands of dollars per American family. Some of that is on the administrative end, some of that is on things like prices that are way too high. You know, pharmaceutical prices that are higher than they need to be in the U.S., elsewhere. Some of it is profit. Like, for example, in pharmaceutical companies, but for example, most hospitals and physician groups are not earning high profit. Where the money is going is it's going to the administrative stuff and to all the other aspects of running things. So, it's almost like the worst of everything because it's not even that someone is benefiting from that money. It's just that we're employing all these people to do stuff that's not contributing to our health, in many ways harming it. Senator Kaine. I wanted to ask, Mr. Benedict, you talked about this physician burnout phenomenon. I have worked with colleagues to pass a bill that we're working to reauthorize now called the Lorna Breen Healthcare Provider Protection Act, which is named after an Emergency Room physician who sadly died by suicide in the beginning phases of COVID who was working in a hospital in New York, got COVID, sat out for two weeks, came back too quickly. Her last publication--she was a very well published physician. Her last publication before she died was on physician burnout. Now, there was a unique burnout during COVID because of the scale of death and injury, but her published work talks about the very phenomenon that you guys were describing, which is, hey, I did this because I want to work with patients. I don't want to be endlessly inputting information. And I think as we look at provider shortages, and particularly in some areas like behavioral health or rural America shortages, they're going to get more acute unless we solve this problem. So, I really appreciate you bringing up the physician burnout piece. When three of the four categories of pressures that create this burnout phenomenon are kind of tied to the reason for the hearing that should make us have a sense of urgency about it. And then, Dr. DiGiorgio, I wanted to drill down on something you said, and I was not quick enough to write it down and follow it. But you said you might hope that we could equalize maybe Medicare fee-for-service, Medicare Advantage reimbursement rates, and then you said something about quality rating system. Tell me what you meant by that. Dr. DiGiorgio. I meant subjecting the CMS fee-for-service to the same star ratings that we give to the Medicare Advantage plans. Senator Kaine. And tell me why that would be a good idea. Dr. DiGiorgio. I think it would increase transparency. I think there's a bit of cost shifting that goes on in fee-for- service. And certainly, the beneficiaries in the fee-for- service model are not subject to the same risk adjustment formula that the beneficiaries in the Medicare Advantage plan are. Senator Kaine. So, I mean, I'm intrigued by this because your testimony is not necessarily anti-regulation. That would be a form of regulation. It would be taking the existing CMS practice and making it better rather than allowing a disharmony that is contributing to negative outcome, so I take your point and I appreciate you bringing that up. I yield back to the Chair. Chairman Whitehouse. Senator Marshall. STATEMENT OF SENATOR MARSHALL Senator Marshall. All right. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. I think I want to start just describing that I've lived this nightmare as a practicing physician for 25 years running a private obstetrician gynecologist (OB/GYN) practice and then additionally as running a private hospital as well. This issue of prior authorization is the number one administrative burden for physicians, but it's also disruptive to the hospital. And Mr. Chairman, you understated the problem. It's hard to imagine that as senators, but we've understated the particular problem. I'll just tell a quick story. Running our hospital had a horrible ice storm on a Wednesday night. Thursday morning the hospital is booked for surgeries. Orthopedic surgeries already starting at 7:30 and they're going to go 'til 10:00 at night. The other operating rooms (ORs) are full. We have a finite number of surgeons, anesthesia, and nursing staff. We had seven or eight admissions overnight. People falling, breaking their wrists, breaking their hip, so I give authority to, look, we're going to bring everybody in at 5:30 in the morning, start the cases at 5:30. A 90-year-old lady fell and broke her hip, which is a critical life-threatening thing to a 90-year-old lady. And you get everybody there and then the administrator comes and says, oh, we can't do this case. How come? Well, we don't have prior authorization yet. You know that story is told over and over that insurance companies are now using this to ration care. It's delaying care and purposefully delaying care hoping, I guess, that they die before they do the surgery. But there's good news. We're going to reintroduce our prior authorization bill, Seniors Timely Access to Care Act this June, and this is the solution. So, we know the solution. Now, we need Congress to move forward. What this bill does, among other things, is set guardrails, streamlines, and standardizes the process for prior authorization. This prior authorization reporting requirement in our bill is the Rx to cut down waste, fraud, and abuse. We've got the solution. Fifty-three Senate co-sponsors, 10 senators on this Committee, including the Chairman, are co- sponsors of this legislation that we're reintroducing in June, if I didn't get that message right. We've got 326 House members. We have 550 outside organizations. We've now got a zero Congressional Budget Office (CBO) score, so I speak to the Minority and the Majority staff that we now have a zero CBO score on it and there shouldn't be any reason that everybody on Budget, on HELP and Finance Committee shouldn't co-sponsor this bill and be passed with unanimous consent. I appreciate the Chairman continuing to highlight this situation. Now, here's the bad news is our bill only addresses Medicare. We need to go into the private practice as well. Certainly, what we're seeing back home is Medicare Advantage, started off as a great thing, kind of a value-based theme, but now it's being abused. Imagine that. That we're having horrible products sold out there over a giveaway for a toaster. You too can have cheap Medicare Advantage solution as well. I don't know that I've got a lot of questions for our witnesses. I'm very grateful. I appreciate your testimony. I've lived the same nightmare that you are living, but maybe, Dr. Benedict, just speak a little bit about the Medicare group versus what you're seeing in the private sector perhaps. Mr. Benedict. Lack of standardization, it varies across the board, depending upon who you're dealing with. Product design, prior auth denials, policies and processes that are different from payer to payer. So, it's very difficult to traverse your way through. We provide scaffolding around our providers to help them to relieve them from that burden. And it's even difficult for us, who know what I consider to be the game around not getting timely responses back and holding back really what's important, care that's necessary to the patient at a time in which it's much important. Senator Marshall. Yes. Dr. Cutler, are you seeing Medicare as a problem, Medicare Advantage, but it's also in the private sector, obviously. Dr. Cutler. It's also in the private sector. It's Medicare Advantage, commercial insurance, and Medicaid are the biggest ones where you see it. Senator Marshall. Dr. DiGiorgio, anything to add? I think we beat the horse pretty good here. Dr. DiGiorgio. Yes, I totally agree. My wife's also an OB/ GYN, so I think she feels the pressure as well as me. And I think, to the administrative burdens, when my four-year-old daughter says she's playing doctor, and that means she takes out her toy laptop and starts typing. She sees my wife and I come home and just spend our waking hours at home---- Senator Marshall. I'm so sad to hear that. Dr. DiGiorgio. Yes, you know, on our laptops. Senator Marshall. This is why none of my kids went into medicine. My wife, a nurse, I'm a doctor, four kids, zero going to healthcare. It's because the administrative burden is the tip of the iceberg, let alone, a nurse who hasn't seen a patient for 10 years telling me I shouldn't do a hysterectomy is very frustrating. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you, Dr. Marshall. What I hope we're going to end up doing here is putting together a package of legislation that focuses in this area of transitioning away from fee-for-service and reducing administrative burdens. And then one of the benefits of being on the Budget Committee is that we get priority attention from CBO so we can do scoring and then we're in a position to recommend to the Finance Committee or to the HELP Committee the package that we've worked on here. So, I'm eager to have your support and input in that process. I am a co-sponsor of that bill and appreciate it very much. As we close, I just want to flag one last area that sort of bedevils me where administrative burdens and administrative tests that are designed for a completely different situation interfere with proper decent, humane provision of care, and that is for patients who are terribly ill and may very well be at or near the end of their lives. When you're in that category, if your family needs you to be in a nursing home for a variety of reasons related to the family's ability to provide care at home, you've got to go and spend three days and two nights in a hospital first, which is, A, terrifying and, B, very expensive. Now, you can see the potential logic for that in a general population with a fee-for-service system to try to limit nursing home spending, but in this particular situation it's stupid, cruel, and expensive. You also look at respite care. There are programs to provide respite care to help home caregivers deal with the stress of having to take care of a family member at home. Respite care sends the patient to a hospital, again, terrifying and expensive, instead of sending a nurse or a nurse practitioner to help the family at home. There are ridiculous standards for being bedridden before you can get home care, which again are nothing but cruel and stupid as you're nearing the end of life. There are plenty of people who three or four days before they pass can walk around the garden and to go out and sit in the garden is a beautiful thing as you're nearing the end of your life. And to say you can't get care because you're not bedridden enough when you're in that situation is cruel, idiotic, and expensive. And there are a package of things like that, and I've been trying to get Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) to offer a program that allows waiver of all of those requirements for a population that is in that circumstance. And in the grand spirit of bureaucratic insensibility, despite years of effort, I'm now through my third CMMI director. They all love it, but nobody can get it done. These are waivers that have all been granted in other circumstances, so it's not a problem with the waiver. This is a population that is not that hard to define. If they wanted, I'd be happy to narrow it to ACO population or federally qualified health center population to run this because I believe that if you stripped all these stupid requirements, you would dramatically improve the experience of those last days and weeks for the families. And so, I'm going to continue to persist on that. I'm actually driving that at the highest levels to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to try to make sure I get their attention because this seems to be such an easy thing to do. So, this problem of bureaucratic requirements has all sorts of tentacles throughout the whole system. And I guess I'll close with a final question for the record to any of you. We've talked here a lot about the over supply of quality reporting measures, including did you like the food, which is nice to know but not exactly pertinent to patient care, the problem of prior authorizations on multiple levels, the turning of EMRs and health information exchange from a benefit into a liability, and the need to get off of fee-for- service and accelerate to hybrid models so people like Mr. Benedict don't have to do double duty and both run a fee-for- service practice at the same time that they're running a value- based practice and double up the administrative load. If there are other areas, like, for instance, my end-of- life thing in which you have thoughts or comments to expand the scope of this hearing, I'd be delighted to hear those as well. This has been a very helpful panel. We really do hope to get this done. We're in a sweet spot here, I think, where doctors can provide better care, patients can receive better care, the healthcare system gets less expensive and burdensome, and it's kind of win/win/win, but we've got to simply have the intellectual rigor to go through decades of bureaucratic underbrush and clear out what is no longer working and fix what needs to be updated. So, thank you all for your help and cooperation in our efforts. And again, thank you to Dr. Marshall, who comes at this, not only as a senator, but also as a practitioner. Thank you. The hearing will adjourn for--what do we have, a week, seven days for anybody else who has QFR, and if you could respond as quickly as possible. With that, I'll call the hearing to its conclusion.
