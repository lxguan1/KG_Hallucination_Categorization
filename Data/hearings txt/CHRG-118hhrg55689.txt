I. KEY MESSAGES
Under the Biden administration, the Council on
Environmental Quality (CEQ) has transformed from a small
staff tasked with ensuring compliance with the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), into a legion of
frontline warriors implementing radical social change and
eco-justice initiatives.
CEQ's role in implementing executive orders and rulemaking
vastly exceeds its statutory authority. Under this
administration, no corner of the government is free from
CEQ's tentacles.
Despite the significant bipartisan NEPA and permitting
reforms in the Fiscal Responsibility Act, CEQ is ignoring
Congress's will and must be held accountable. CEQ's Phase 2
NEPA Rule will hinder efforts to build critical
infrastructure. It is eroding progress when the government
should be reducing permitting burdens and streamlining
bureaucratic processes.
II. WITNESS
The Honorable Brenda Mallory, Chair, Council on
Environmental Quality, Washington, DC
III. BACKGROUND
CEQ, housed within the Executive Office of the President, oversees
federal agency compliance with NEPA,\1\ issuing regulations and
guidance detailing how federal agencies must implement and comply with
the statute.\2\ Notably, although NEPA authorized CEQ, a 1978 Executive
Order (EO) charged CEQ to issue regulations applicable to all federal
agencies regarding preparing an Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS).\3\ CEQ was not, however, authorized to enforce these
regulations.\4\ Over the decades, this first EO authorized by President
Nixon has been updated, expanded upon, and supplemented with additional
guidance by multiple presidents.\5\

a. CEQ's Budget Request
The explosive growth of CEQ's mission and bureaucratic morass is
mirrored in the dramatic rise of its budget. CEQ's budget remained
relatively stable since its inception until it received an infusion of
funding through the Inflation Reduction Act.\6\ From 2019 to 2023,
CEQ's baseline budget grew from $2.89 million to approximately $4.67
million--an increase of approximately 63% over four years. In addition,
CEQ received $62.5 million from the Inflation Reduction Act to support
environmental and climate data collection as well as CEQ's baseline
functions for ``training personnel, developing programmatic
environmental documents, and developing tools, guidance, and
technologies to improve stakeholder and community engagement.'' \7\ The
President's Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 Budget reports an unexpired,
unobligated balance of $63 million for FY 2023, an estimate of $58
million for FY 2024, and an estimate of $42 million for FY 2025.\8\
Despite the unexpired and unobligated balance, the President's budget
requests $4.67 million in appropriations for FY 2025.\9\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to increases in the agency's budget, CEQ's staffing,
which generally ranged from 17-25 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees,
has also increased. According to the President's FY 2024 Budget
request, CEQ supported 17 FTE's in 2022, and estimated this number
would increase to 36 in FY 2023 and 2024.\10\ In an official document
uploaded to CEQ's website in May 2023, more than 100 employees--
including fellows--are listed (nearly doubling the agency's listed
staff size from the year prior).\11\ It is unclear how many of the
staff are CEQ employees and how many are on detail from other federal
agencies. The President's FY 2025 Budget request reports the total
number of actual FTEs in FY 2023 at 32 (nearly doubling the staff size
from the year prior) and estimates the FTE for FY 2024 and 2025 at 54,
nearly doubling the size of FY 2023 staffing level.\12\

b. CEQ's Role has Transformed from Ensuring NEPA Compliance to a
Government-Wide Agency Tasked with Implementing President
Biden's Radical Social and Environmental Justice Agenda
President Biden has transformed CEQ's role from overseeing NEPA
compliance to implementing his radical eco-agenda, remaking federal
agencies as vehicles of social change, and leading the war on domestic
energy production.\13\ As Chair of CEQ, Brenda Mallory has described
her role as ``focused particularly on addressing the environmental
justice and climate change challenges.'' \14\ CEQ's chief of staff
describes the responsibilities and powers that President Biden has
bestowed upon CEQ as ``unprecedented.'' \15\

CEQ Implements President Biden's Radical Social Change and Eco-Agenda
Executive Orders
On his first day in office, President Biden issued Executive Order
(EO) 13990. This EO aimed to bolster resilience to climate change,
restore and expand national monuments, prioritize environmental
justice, and ``create the well-paying union jobs necessary to deliver
on these goals.'' \16\ Practically speaking, the EO required all
government agencies to immediately review all existing government
regulations promulgated by the previous administration that may have
been inconsistent with the goals of EO 13990.\17\ The Chair of CEQ was
directed to consult on the national monument review process,
participate as a member of the Interagency Working Group on the Social
Cost of Greenhouse Gases, and more. In addition, EO 13990 canceled the
construction permit for the Keystone XL pipeline and revoked several
executive orders published by the Trump administration, including those
that prioritized permitting streamlining and infrastructure
development.\18\

The following week, Biden issued EO 14008, which mandated broad
environmental justice goals for the federal government to ensure
environmental and economic justice are key considerations in how we
govern.\19\ EO 14008 established--among other initiatives--the National
Climate Task Force, which is chaired by the National Climate Advisor
and includes the Chair of CEQ as a member.\20\ Additionally, the EO
directed the Chair of CEQ to lead the Federal Clean Electricity and
Vehicle Procurement Strategy, which would work to facilitate a carbon
free electricity sector by 2035, and clean or zero-emission vehicle
fleets for federal, state, local, and tribal governments.\21\ CEQ was
further directed to update federal procurement standards and work with
relevant Cabinet officials on renewable energy siting and permitting
plans.\22\

EO 14008 also established two new councils within the White House
responsible for implementing environmental justice in government
actions: the White House Environmental Justice Interagency Council
(IAC) and the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council
(WHEJAC).\23\ Both IAC and WHEJAC report to CEQ and work to develop and
institute Biden's radical eco-agenda and wage war on domestic energy
production.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\23\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The IAC--primarily composed of leading Cabinet officials and White
House advisors--is charged with promoting and coordinating
environmental justice initiatives across the executive branch.\24\ It
is also tasked with developing environmental justice performance
metrics and issuing a scorecard on agency implementation of
environmental justice goals.\25\ For example, the IAC advised CEQ's
creation of the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool,\26\ a tool
to identify what communities will receive federal benefits for
affordable housing and environmental justice projects.\27\ CEQ Chair
Brenda Mallory also chairs the IAC.\28\

environmental injustice.\29\ For example, in August 2022, WHEJAC issued
recommendations on how to transform the practices of all federal
agencies and ensure Justice40 Initiatives are used to address
``systemic inequities.'' \30\ WHEJAC's recommendations included
mandating every federal agency to convene a board of environmental and
climate justice advocates, requiring state and local agencies to use
CEQ's Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool, prioritizing the
recruitment and training of staff with expertise in environmental and
climate justice, and prohibiting the use of Justice40 Initiative funds
to support fossil fuel infrastructure or generation.\31\

The Justice40 Initiative--also created by EO 14008--is chaired by
CEQ and seeks to direct 40 percent of certain federal investments to
disadvantaged communities, which are not defined. The White House has
issued formal Interim Implementation Guidance directing all federal
agencies to identify which of their programs are covered under the
Justice40 Initiative and to begin implementing reforms to those
programs.\32\ Without Congressional authorization, Justice40 is
changing the way hundreds of federal programs across government touch
climate change, clean energy, transit, housing, workforce development,
remediation of legacy pollution, and critical infrastructure
operate.\33\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
EO 14008 also established the administration's 30x30 agenda, which
seeks to preserve 30 percent of our lands and waters by 2030.\34\ Since
re-branding 30x30 as the America the Beautiful Initiative, for over two
and a half years the administration has failed to provide basic
definitions or baseline metrics for what counts towards this goal,
while using 30x30 to justify taking preservationist actions like
designating national monuments or initiating mineral withdrawals. In
fact, the Biden administration has issued 7 monument designations,
locking up over 3.62 million acres of land, and implemented onerous
restrictions on a Marine National Monument off the coast of New
England.\35\ Just this month, the Biden administration expanded two
monuments in California by 120,000 acres and there are reports the
administration is under pressure to expand or designate several new
monuments throughout the remainder of the year.\36\ In many instances,
the expansion or creation of new monuments has been met with
considerable pushback from state and local officials, notably in
Colorado and Utah. The administration also created a $1 billion 30x30
slush fund--with no statutory authority or clearly defined funding
sources--to fund vaguely defined projects consistent with 30x30. A
letter sent by Committee Republicans in May 2022 to Chair Mallory
asking specific questions about this fund has gone unanswered.\37\

On April 19, 2024, the White House announced the creation of
Conservation.gov, a ``website that will help connect people with

with the beta version of the American Conservation and Stewardship
Atlas (The Atlas) to track 30x30 progress.\38\ This included a
preliminary framework for assessing 30x30 progress, summarized in the
diagram below.\39\ The Atlas also included preliminary assessment of
progress, including ``13 percent of U.S. lands that are permanently
protected and not subject to extractive uses'' and 26 percent of marine
areas are designated as Marine Protected Areas (MPA).\40\ However, The
Atlas is not complete, and CEQ acknowledges additional data is needed
for a more precise estimate.

On May 20, 2021, President Biden issued EO 14030, Climate-Related
Financial Risk, which, among other things, directs CEQ and other agency
heads to consider amending the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and
require major federal suppliers to publicly disclose greenhouse gas
emissions and climate-related financial risk, and to ``set science-
based reduction targets.'' \43\ Further, EO 14030 grants CEQ the power
to amend the FAR to favor bids and proposals from suppliers with a
lower social cost of greenhouse gas emissions.\44\

In April 2022, President Biden issued Executive Order 14072,
directing the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department
of the Interior (DOI) to define, identify, and inventory mature and old
growth forests on public lands by April 22, 2023, and subsequently
develop policies to protect those forests.\45\ The interagency mature
and old growth initiative began in July 2022 with a Federal Register
Notice and public comment period, resulting in roughly 4,000 responses
and more than 100,000 signatures on various form letters from across
the country.\46\ In April of last year, the Forest Service (USFS)
published an ``initial draft'' seeking to define and inventory ``old-
growth and mature forests'' and even convened a ``Definition
Development Team.'' \47\ All of these efforts have failed to create a
single, coherent definition for ``old-growth'' or ``mature'' forests.
This is a predictable failure as no standard definition exists for
``old growth forests'' and ``mature forests'' and they are not terms
recognized in the scientific practice of forestry. Despite this lack of
clear definitions, the report identified 32.7 million acres of old
growth and 80.1 million acres of mature forest in USFS and Bureau of
Land Management lands.\48\ There are over 91 million acres of old-
growth and mature forested lands on national forests, which is 63
percent of all USFS land.\49\

The administration ultimately admitted ``these `definitions' are
considered dynamic, not static, and thus are subject to refinement as
new information is incorporated (working definitions).'' \50\ Despite
this lack of a real definition, the administration released an
introductory report in January that identified wildfire, insects, and
diseases as the leading threats to mature and old-growth forests, and
even admitted that ``tree cutting'' is a minor threat that generally
``improved or maintained'' the stands that had been managed.\51\ In a
continuation of this misguided and incomplete effort, the Biden
administration published a Notice of Intent to amend all 128 national
forest land management plans to provide direction on how to manage,
conserve and steward old-growth forest conditions.\52\ A draft
Environmental Impact Statement is expected this summer, and the
amendment process is expected to be completed in early 2025.\53\

agencies. Nonetheless, the IAC, WHEJAC, and the White House Office of
Environmental Justice all report to and take orders from the same
entity--CEQ.

c. CEQ's Active Role in Rules that Attack Domestic Energy Production
and Increase Regulatory Burdens
CEQ has taken an active role in the Biden administration's rules
that attack domestic energy development and increase regulatory burdens
on American businesses. Chief among the examples of CEQ and the Biden
administration's crusade against American energy production and the
strength of America's economy are the Greenhouse Gas Rule, the
empowerment of the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi), and the
promulgation of rules related to NEPA and permitting reforms that do
not adequately adhere to the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (Fiscal
Responsibility Act).
Greenhouse Gas Rule
In November 2022, the Biden administration proposed a rule,
Disclosure of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate-Related Financial
Risk (the Proposed GHG Disclosure Rule), to mandate that government
contractors publicly ``disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and
climate-related financial risk and set science-based targets to reduce
their greenhouse gas emissions.'' \61\ If finalized, the Proposed GHG
Disclosure Rule would implement Section 5(b)(i) of the aforementioned
EO 14030, Climate-Related Financial Risk.\62\ The Proposed GHG
Disclosure Rule mandates ``major'' government contractors, defined as
those with contracts valued at over $50 million, develop ``science-
based reduction targets'' that are validated and approved by an
international non-governmental organization known as SBTi.\63\

for the proposed rule closed on January 13, 2023, and the Director of
the Defense Acquisition Regulation (DAR) Council tasked the Acquisition
Environmental and Contract Management Team with issuing a report by
April 19, 2023, to facilitate the finalization of the GHG Disclosure
Rule, the report deadline has been extended to May 22, 2024.\65\

The Proposed GHG Disclosure Rule far exceeds the original authority
granted by President Biden. Most problematically, EO 14030 does not
require--nor does President Biden have the authority to require--a
reduction target validation by a private international non-governmental
organization like SBTi.
Science Based Target Initiative
In its Proposed GHG Disclosure Rule, CEQ seeks to significantly
exceed the authority President Biden granted CEQ in EO 14030 by
offloading its responsibility to set standards for greenhouse gas
emissions to SBTi and require all major contractors use SBTi validation
services.\66\ Essentially, CEQ wants to promulgate a rule imposing
draconian ``science-based targets,'' but outsource the ability to
``validate'' and enforce the targets to a monopolistic international
non-governmental organization--a dereliction of duty of the highest
order.\67\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In March 2023, the House Committee on Natural Resources
(Committee), along with the House Committee on Science, Space, and
Technology (SST Committee), launched an investigation into CEQ, SBTi,
and SBTi's selection as the sole arbitrator--effectively judge, jury,
and executioner--of emission reduction targets for federal
contractors.\68\ On June 22, 2023, during last year's hearing regarding
CEQ and its budget, the Committee asked CEQ Chair Mallory multiple
questions related to SBTi.\69\ Those questions--on SBTi's selection
through an uncompetitive process, SBTi's foreign identity and
influences, SBTi's emission assessment processes, and SBTi's conflicts
of interest--went unanswered.\70\

Subsequently, on September 6, 2023, the Committee sent a letter to
CEQ and Chair Mallory reemphasizing its concerns about CEQ's
outsourcing its compliance authority to SBTi and requesting targeted
documents and information related to SBTi in CEQ's possession.\71\
After acknowledging receipt of the Committee's letter, CEQ ignored the
Committee's concerns and failed to respond.\72\ The Committee sent a
second letter to CEQ and Chair Mallory on October 17, 2023, once again
requesting CEQ to produce documents and information responsive to the
Committee's requests, which were grounded in serious concerns about
SBTi and its empowerment by CEQ.\73\

Meanwhile, the SST Committee held two hearings--in September and
November 2023--on SBTi and improprieties in CEQ's outsourcing of its
authority to the foreign organization.\74\ Eventually, after pressure
from both committees, in December 2023, CEQ produced documents
responsive to some of the Committee's concerns. These released
documents, as well as other materials uncovered by the Committee and
the SST Committee, served as a foundation for a January 2024 SST
Committee staff memo on preliminary findings from both committees'
investigation into SBTi. The investigation's preliminary findings
include CEQ's inappropriately influencing the FAR Council to benefit
SBTi and other environmental activist groups; a coordinated effort to
fast-track SBTi's selection and drown out genuine concerns related to
SBTi; misleading CEQ testimony during congressional hearings; and--
perhaps most alarmingly--national security concerns related to SBTi
given its international nature and the ability of foreign adversaries
to both impact domestic procurement awards and collect potentially
sensitive information about federal government contractors.\75\ The
Committee's investigation into CEQ and SBTi is ongoing.

NEPA & Permitting Reforms under the Fiscal Responsibility Act
In April 2022, CEQ instituted rules to roll back aspects of the
Trump administration's 2020 NEPA regulations and to bolster cumbersome
aspects of NEPA that increase the regulatory burdens for building
pipelines and other energy infrastructure.\76\ CEQ referred to this
rulemaking as its Phase 1 of revisions to existing NEPA
regulations.\77\ On May 1, 2024, CEQ published its final rule
instituting Phase 2 of its overhaul, with broader changes to the 2020
NEPA regulations.\78\ In significant part, the Phase 2 regulation's
purpose was to implement the bipartisan Fiscal Responsibility Act,\79\
signed by President Biden on June 2, 2023, which provides the first
significant NEPA and permitting reforms in over forty years. Regarding
NEPA, the Fiscal Responsibility Act: \80\

Provides Statutory Clarity. Clarifies and narrows agency
considerations of impacts, effects, and alternatives to
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
assess whether NEPA applies to a proposed activity.
Promotes Interagency Coordination and Timely Reviews.
Codifies key elements of the One Federal Decision Framework
for all projects that must undergo NEPA review. This
includes the designation of a lead agency to set a
permitting schedule, procedures to elevate and streamline
delays or disputes, and the preparation of a single
document for environmental reviews involving multiple
agencies.
Streamlines Review Process. Allows agencies to adopt
categorical exclusions utilized by other agencies through a
streamlined review process.
Clarifies Major Federal Action. Major federal actions are
limited to those subject to federal control and
responsibility. It also includes examples of actions that
are not major federal actions.
Involves Project Sponsors in the Preparation of
Environmental Reviews. Allows project sponsors to assist
agencies in conducting environmental reviews to help speed
up the process and resolve issues without taking control or
authority away from the lead agency.
Limits the Length of Environmental Impact Statements and
Assessments. Sets 150-page limits for environmental impact
statements (300 pages if the project is of extraordinary
complexity) and 75-page limits for environmental
assessments. Sets time limits of one year for environmental
assessments and two years for environmental impact
statements. Provides a right of action to project
applicants if the agency does not adhere to these
deadlines.
Promotes the Adaptation of Modern Technology. Directs CEQ
to study modernizing the NEPA process by utilizing digital
technologies to create an online portal to streamline
communications and data sharing between agencies and
project applicants.
Yet, CEQ's Phase 2 final rule largely ignores the Fiscal
Responsibility Act's prescriptions in favor of further progressing the
Biden administration's radical environmental justice agenda. Rather
than abide by the Fiscal Responsibility Act's significant NEPA and
permitting reforms intended to make it easier to build in America,
speed up timelines for critical infrastructure projects, and reduce the
burden on taxpayers by creating efficiencies in the permitting process,
CEQ's Phase 2 rule weaponizes the NEPA process to delay critical
domestic energy projects at a time when our nation should pursue energy
independence. This includes exasperating extensive delays of onshore
lease sales on federal lands.\81\ In fact, rather than streamline the
permitting process fairly for all projects under NEPA, Phase 2
subjectively accelerates procedures for CEQ's favored energy sources
like wind and solar while effectively mummifying domestic oil and gas
production with red tape.\82\ As the White House itself made clear, the
NEPA Phase 2 regulations aim to ``address climate change'' and
``advance environmental justice'' instead of implementing positive
bipartisan permitting reform that would benefit Americans, as Congress
directed in the Fiscal Responsibility Act.\83\

CEQ Guides Administration's Protective Oceans and Waters Policy
The Biden administration has implemented its radical climate and
preservation goals for our oceans and waters through several
interconnected initiatives, including EO 14008, the 30x30 Strategy, the
Ocean Climate Action Plan (OCAP), and the related Ocean Justice
Initiative. The administration is weaponizing oceans and fisheries
policy and MPA designations to satisfy these climate goals, as
described in several White House Initiatives below.
The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and CEQ, working
with the White House Ocean Policy Committee (OPC) released the OCAP in
March 2023, a government-wide strategy to advance President Biden's
climate initiatives through oceans and fisheries related policies,
including conserving at least 30% of U.S. waters by 2030.\84\ The
stated goals of the OCAP are to:

Create a Carbon Neutral Future through advancing offshore
wind and marine energy, implementing policies towards
achieving zero greenhouse gas emissions from international
maritime shipping by no later than 2050, and discover
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
additional ways to sequester carbon in the ocean;
Accelerate Nature-Based Solutions through protecting
marine environments that naturally store carbon, and the
utilization of MPAs; and
Enhance Community Resilience to Ocean Change through
oceans, fisheries and aquaculture policies, the protection
of certain species, and enhancing coastal resilience.\85\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\85\ Id.
On April 17, 2024, CEQ released Progress Report: Year One of Ocean
Climate Action to summarize the administration's actions taken so far
under the OCAP, including advancing environmental justice through the
Ocean Justice Strategy, scaling up the offshore wind energy industry,
advancing the decarbonization of the U.S. marine transportation system,
enhancing community resilience, and addressing and mitigating the
impacts of climate change.\86\

As directed by the OCAP,\87\ in June 2023, CEQ first sought public
input to determine the concept of `ocean justice' including: ``What is
ocean justice?' and ``What are the barriers for realizing ocean
justice?'' \88\ These questions demonstrated `ocean justice' is a
concept the administration themselves did not understand and it
revealed the lack of need for such programming. On December 22, 2023,
CEQ, OSTP, and OCP released their Ocean Justice Strategy.\89\ The Ocean
Justice Strategy describes `ocean justice' as deriving from
``environmental justice with a specific focus on communities with
environmental justice concerns that rely on the ocean and Great Lakes
for economic, cultural, spiritual, and recreational purposes, and food
security.'' \90\ The Ocean Justice Strategy also stated three action
items for accomplishing `ocean justice':

d. Expanding and Implementing New Marine Protected Areas
One of the tools the administration has utilized to accomplish its
30x30 strategy is the development of MPAs, which are designations,
often national marine sanctuaries or marine national monuments, used by
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and DOI to
limit human activity in certain areas of the marine environment to
protect all or part of the designated environment.\94\ Restricted
activities differ by MPA, but generally could include commercial
fishing, mining, oil and gas production, and renewable energy
development.\95\

On January 26, 2024, CEQ released their third annual America the
Beautiful 2023 Annual Report, which provided an update on the
administration's 30x30 strategy as it relates to this nation's
waters.\96\ The report describes how NOAA has furthered work on
designations for six new national marine sanctuaries, including
initiating the public scoping process for a national marine sanctuary
for the Pacific Remote Islands, releasing the draft designation for the
Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, nearing the completion of
the Lake Ontario national marine sanctuary in early 2024, moving
forward with the sanctuary designation processes for Hudson Canyon, and
continuing the designation processes for proposed sanctuaries in Lake
Erie and Papahanaumokuakea (Northwestern Hawaiian Islands).\97\ The
report also proposed two national estuarine research reserves in the
Atchafalaya Basin in Louisiana and the Bay of Green Bay in
Wisconsin.\98\

President Biden has weaponized these MPA designations to accomplish
his radical climate goals without considering the negative consequences
on the economy for affected communities.\99\ For example, in March
2023, the administration announced the consideration of ``a new
National Marine Sanctuary designation . . . to protect all U.S. waters
around the Pacific Remote Islands'' to accomplish the President's 30x30
goal.\100\ However, the Pacific Remote Island Area provides critical
fishing grounds for tuna species for U.S. vessels in the South Pacific.
Otherwise, vessels are restricted in fishing access to the high seas,
and must pay thousands of dollars per day to fish within the exclusive
economic zones (EEZ) of other nations.\101\ According to the Western
Pacific Regional FMC, since 2018, ``the U.S. tuna purse seine fleet,
which supplies the American Samoa tuna cannery, has dwindled from 38
vessels to 15 vessels today.'' \102\ If the Biden administration
implements the MPA designation with commercial tuna fishing
restrictions, it will force the remaining U.S. purse seiner fleet to
either discontinue operations, or fish farther away waters and deliver
their catch to foreign ports.\103\

Additionally, tuna fishing and processing is the main driver for
the American Samoa economy, providing employment to approximately 5,000
of the 18,000-person workforce \104\--StarKist Tuna cannery is the
largest employer in the territory.\105\ If the proposed sanctuary were
to prohibit tuna fishing, the tuna industry and the communities that
depend on it would be decimated by the loss of revenue and fishing
access.\106\ For example, following the closure of one of the two
canneries in American Samoa over a decade ago, American Samoa's gross

MPA designations also conflict with the gold standard for fisheries
management, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management
Act (MSA),\108\ which established eight regional Fishery Management
Councils (FMC) to apply national standards, prepare fishery management
plans to prevent overfishing, rebuild overfished stocks, facilitate
long-term protection of essential fish habitats, realize the full
potential of the Nation's fishery resources, and establish regulations
for fisheries that require conservation and management.\109\ Instead of
the FMCs guiding fisheries management as intended under the MSA, the
White House is skirting their authority through MPA designations that
can outright ban commercial fishing without justification.\110\ In a
letter to former Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, the FMCs stated:

Designations of marine national monuments that prohibit fishing
activities--especially those that did not receive adequate
economic and social impact review and did not allow for a
robust public review process--have disrupted the ability of the
Councils to manage fisheries throughout their range as required
by MSA and in an ecosystem-based manner. Marine monument
designations have the potential to be counterproductive to
achieving domestic fishery management goals.\111\

IV. CONCLUSION
President Biden has transformed CEQ's role from overseeing NEPA
compliance to implementing his radical eco-agenda, remaking federal
agencies as vehicles of social change, and leading the war on domestic
energy production. A bureaucratic morass of various agencies, offices,
and councils report to and take directions from CEQ. At the same time,
CEQ's role in implementing executive orders and rulemaking vastly
exceeds its statutory role and prescribed authority. CEQ has chosen to
weaponize NEPA to carry out the Biden administration's radical
environmental justice agenda rather than abide by the Fiscal
Responsibility Act's significant NEPA and permitting reforms--reforms
that will make it easier to build in America, speed up timelines for
critical infrastructure projects, and reduce the burden on taxpayers by
creating efficiencies in the permitting process. Additionally, CEQ must
be held accountable for its improper intimate relationship with SBTi
and other environmental activist groups.

I now recognize myself for an opening statement.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARKANSAS
The Chairman. Good morning, everyone. Welcome, Chair
Mallory. Thank you for being here with us today.
Under the Biden administration, CEQ has transformed from an
agency charged with overseeing Federal agencies' NEPA
compliance to an agency that reaches into nearly every facet of
American life. CEQ serves as the tip of the spear for
implementing President Biden's radical agenda, retooling
Federal agencies as vehicles of social change, and assaulting
domestic energy production. CEQ's implementation of Executive
Orders and rulemaking oversteps its bounds, blatantly ignoring
the will of Congress. Today, no one is spared from CEQ's
overreach.
CEQ's metamorphosis is reflected in its bloated budget.
Though CEQ has only ever been authorized to receive $1 million
in Federal funds this year, the President's budget requests
more than $4.6 million and 54 full-time equivalent staff for
CEQ. This is in addition to more than $42 million in unexpired
and unobligated balances for Fiscal Year 2025 that are remnants
of the Inflation Reduction Act. It begs the question, how much
taxpayer money does CEQ actually deserve? With CEQ leading the
charge, the Biden administration has irreparably damaged
America's natural resources and the jobs and communities they
support.
Chair Mallory, you recently likened CEQ's role in the Biden
administration to ``laying the foundation for this house that
we are building together.'' You continue by noting that your
work is ``just the beginning.'' A foundation of structural
flaws cannot build a home that stands the test of time. We know
that building a house on rock is wise. We have learned that.
But President Biden's sweeping climate environmental justice
Executive Orders are trying to build a house on sand. Policies
like the Justice40 and the 30x30 initiative have weakened, not
strengthened, America's foundation.
CEQ's crusade against domestic energy production empowers
our foreign adversaries. Rulemakings, including the Greenhouse
Gas Rule, the science-based target initiative, and the
distortion of a Phase 2 NEPA, which blatantly ignores
congressional directives, actively puts America in jeopardy.
Misguided Executive Orders that lock up so-called old growth
forests and restrict access to Federal waters for commercial
and recreational fishing are not ``building a new house.''
Rather, they are destroying the American foundation.
This Committee has repeatedly sought to rein in CEQ's
improper influence over the Federal Government. It has launched
four separate investigations into CEQ's activities. Despite
formal letters from Committee members and detailed follow-up by
Committee staff, CEQ has failed to provide substantial
responses to the Committee's inquiries. CEQ's repeated lack of
response to oversight requests, other than acknowledging
receipt or offering terse replies, is not acceptable.
Chair Mallory, I appreciate your appearing here today. I
look forward to your testimony, the questions from our Members,
and the answers that you will provide.
I now recognize Vice Ranking Member Kamlager-Dove for her
opening statement.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. SYDNEY KAMLAGER-DOVE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
Ms. Kamlager-Dove. Thank you, Chairman.
And thank you very much, Chairwoman, for being here with us
today. I do want to give you a bit of forewarning, although I
am guessing you are already aware, that today's hearing is
likely to feature a range of hyperbole and theatrics from my
colleagues across the aisle especially spectacular, even for
them. After all, the Council on Environmental Quality, which
you lead, is responsible for implementing what I have come to
find out during my time on this Committee is the Majority's
public enemy No. 1, the National Environmental Policy Act, or
NEPA, a Nixon legacy, no doubt.
If you want any assurance of that fact, you need not look
any further than the first few months of the 118th Congress. My
Majority colleagues wasted no time in immediately rolling out
bills, including their H.R. 1, the Polluters Over People Act
intended to gut NEPA's most fundamental and sacred provisions.
As a new Member of Congress at the time, I couldn't help but
wonder what was behind this political vendetta. From where I
stand, NEPA is not just one of the most important protections
we have for our environment, it is absolutely essential to this
country's pursuit of equity and justice.
For decades, low-income communities, communities of color,
and tribal communities have been purposely and relentlessly
targeted by polluting industries as the preferred siting
location for their dirtiest messes. And let's be clear, it is
not because these communities didn't care or didn't voice their
opposition loud and clear. They did. They were simply pushed
aside, silenced, or ignored. But with NEPA, their voices must
be heard.
NEPA enshrined into law the American people's right to
weigh in on major Federal projects or permit decisions, and
when unlawful permit decisions or otherwise dangerous projects
are put in place, NEPA gives communities the right to challenge
them through judicial review. And as the climate crisis impacts
the same overburdened communities first and worst, there is no
question that NEPA is as important, if not more, than it has
ever been.
That is why I am so grateful for your leadership, Chair
Mallory. When you took the helm at CEQ, you inherited a suite
of extreme Trump-era NEPA rollbacks that willfully ignored both
the climate crisis and the cumulative impacts of multiple
sources of pollution, putting American families directly in
harm's way. But the Council's recently finalized Phase 2 NEPA
regulations have turned the page on these pro-polluter
priorities.
Under the Biden administration, CEQ is putting climate,
communities, and environmental justice back into focus for a
future that serves all Americans, not just those lucky enough
to afford to live where polluters won't go. But, of course, as
we will see today, not everyone is happy with the change. My
colleagues across the aisle have made a veritable art out of
scheming and designing giveaways for their polluting industry
friends, namely big oil. Or in the case of the former
President, they are simply asking big oil to draft the
giveaways for them.
So, when you have an Administration like this one that is
committed to protecting the American people, rather than
bending over backwards to prop up the already record-breaking
profits of big oil, we can fully expect the GOP to come out
with their proverbial guns blazing. Although in this Committee,
we can actually bring real guns. We will likely hear their
usual protests about high energy prices, even though I dare say
these arguments fall a little flat in light of the recent
complaint from the Federal Trade Commission showing how big oil
colluded with OPEC to raise energy prices.
We may hear about permitting delays, even though not a
single one of my Republican colleagues voted with Democrats to
pass more than $1 billion in funding through the Inflation
Reduction Act to address staff capacity and resources in
permitting offices. Experts have repeatedly identified
insufficient staff capacity, not NEPA itself, as a top reason
for permitting delays.
Basically, we will hear a lot, and probably at loud
volumes. So, I want to commend you in advance, Chairwoman, not
just for the patience you will likely need to employ today, but
for your commitment to carrying out the Council's mandate to
deliver clean air, clean water, and a healthy environment for
all Americans, no matter how well funded the opposition may be.
Thank you. I yield back.
The Chairman. I will now introduce our witness, the
Honorable Brenda Mallory, Chair of the Council on Environmental
Quality.
Let me remind you that under Committee Rules, you must
limit your oral statement to 5 minutes, but your entire
statement will appear in the hearing record.
To begin your testimony, please press the ``on'' button on
the microphone.
We use timing lights. When you begin, the light will turn
green. At the end of 5 minutes, the light will turn red, and I
will ask you to please complete your statement.
I now recognize Chair Mallory for 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. BRENDA MALLORY, CHAIR, COUNCIL ON
ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY, WASHINGTON, DC
Ms. Mallory. Thank you, Chairman Westerman, Vice Ranking
Member Kamlager-Dove, and distinguished members of the
Committee. It is really a privilege to be here with you today.
Congress established the Council on Environmental Quality
more than 50 years ago to advise the President on environmental
policy. Some of the specific environmental challenges we face
today are different than they were a half century ago, but many
of our goals and much of our focus remains the same. Our
nation's rivers no longer catch on fire, yet we have much work
to do to bring them back to full health. Our skies are no
longer blanketed by acid rain producing sulfur dioxide, but now
we must slash climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions and
reduce toxic pollutants. We have saved hundreds of wildlife
species from extinction, yet natural areas and wildlife habitat
are continuing to disappear.
CEQ's mission to help deliver clean water, clean air, and a
healthy environment to all is as important today as it has ever
been. That is why I am so proud of the work that we have done
under President Biden and Vice President Harris' leadership.
Today, I will highlight progress we have made in three key
areas that the President's Fiscal Year 2025 budgets support.
First, confronting the climate crisis and deploying clean
energy. President Biden is leading the most ambitious climate
agenda in history. Thanks to his leadership and Congress'
landmark legislation, we are making once-in-a-generation
investments in clean energy and infrastructure, while creating
millions of good-paying jobs. The Council on Environmental
Quality is proud to play a key role in advancing this work.
That includes modernizing Federal permitting and environmental
review processes.
Thanks to President Biden's Permitting Action Plan and the
nearly $1 billion dedicated through the Inflation Reduction Act
to boost permitting capacity at Federal agencies, we have
expanded the Federal permitting workforce, incorporated new
technologies, and improved coordination of permitting
processes.
We also worked with Congress on a bipartisan basis to
enact, as part of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, the
most significant changes to the National Environmental Policy
Act since the law was enacted. CEQ recently finalized the
bipartisan Permitting Reform Implementation Rule, which fully
implements these bipartisan reforms, as well as additional
steps that modernize and accelerate the permitting process.
Second, CEQ is helping confront the long-standing
environmental injustices to better protect people from
environmental harms and deliver clean air, clean water, and a
healthy environment for all. The Administration continues to
make progress to combat toxins, like asbestos and PFAS, while
cleaning up legacy pollution, reclaiming abandoned land mines,
capping orphan oil and gas wells, and replacing toxic lead
pipes.
As part of the President's commitment to environmental
justice, the Council on Environmental Quality is focused on
strengthening government-wide technical assistance and capacity
building, which is helping communities access the
Administration's historic resources. Our White House Office of
Environmental Justice is coordinating implementation of
environmental justice policies across the Federal Government,
including delivering on the President's vision for the
Justice40 Initiative.
Third, we are supporting locally-led conservation of our
nation's lands and waters. In the first days in office,
President Biden established the country's first national
conservation goal to protect, conserve, and restore at least 30
percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030. To reach this goal we
launched the America the Beautiful initiative, and are
supporting one of the most rapid accelerations of locally-led
conservation in our nation's history.
Notably, conservation across the country has been driven by
local efforts of ranchers, farmers, fishers, forest owners,
Tribal Nations, communities, and others to safeguard the health
and integrity of the lands and waters upon which we all depend.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, and I look
forward to our continued partnership, and welcome any questions
that you may have.

Prepared Statement of Brenda Mallory, Chair,
Council on Environmental Quality
Introduction
Chairman Westerman, Vice Ranking Member Kamlager-Dove, and
distinguished Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity
to testify in support of President Biden's Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 Budget
for the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). It is an honor and a
privilege to be here with you today.
Congress established CEQ more than fifty years ago to advise the
President on environmental policy, document and define changes in the
natural environment, and help coordinate environmental policies and
programs across the Federal government. In particular, the law
establishing CEQ--the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of
1969--directs CEQ ``to develop and recommend to the President national
policies to foster and promote the improvement of environmental quality
to meet the conservation, social, economic, health, and other
requirements and goals of the Nation.''
Some of the specific environmental challenges we face today are
different than they were half a century ago, but many of our goals and
much of our focus remains the same. Our nation's rivers no longer catch
on fire, yet we have much work to do to bring them back to full health
and to rid our waterways and drinking water systems of toxic chemicals.
Our skies are no longer blanketed by acid rain-producing sulfur
dioxide, but now we must slash the greenhouse gas emissions that are
warming our climate and the toxic pollution that imperils our
communities. Our country has successfully saved hundreds of wildlife
species from extinction, yet natural areas and wildlife habitat are
continuing to rapidly disappear, and safe and accessible outdoor
opportunities remain out of reach for too many.
CEQ's mission--to help deliver clean water, clean air, and a
healthy environment for all people in our country--is as important
today as it ever has been. That is why I am so proud of the work we
have done over the past three and a half years under President Biden
and Vice President Harris's leadership. Much of the progress we have
made at CEQ and across the Administration on these critical issues--
from improving the efficiency and effectiveness of environmental
reviews to tackling so-called forever chemicals, or PFAS--has been
enabled by bipartisan collaboration with Congress and historic
investments from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law (BIL), the CHIPS and Science Act (CHIPS), and the
Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
President Biden's Fiscal Year 2025 Budget
Today, I will talk about our priorities and progress at CEQ, how
this work is helping advance the President's climate, conservation, and
environmental justice agenda for our country, and the areas on which we
intend to focus in FY 2025.
The President has proposed a budget of $4.676 million in
discretionary appropriations for CEQ, an increase of $47,000 from the
FY 2024 enacted budget. The FY 2025 budget builds on critical
investments in the IRA (P.L. 117-169) and supports the following
priorities and goals for the country:
Confronting climate change, accelerating the deployment of
clean energy and vital infrastructure, and improving
environmental review and permitting processes;
Delivering clean air, clean water, and a healthy
environment for all; and
Supporting locally led conservation of our nation's lands,
waters, and wildlife.
Confronting Climate Change, Accelerating the Deployment of Clean Energy
and Vital Infrastructure, and Improving Environmental Review
and Permitting Processes
Thanks to President Biden's leadership and Congress's passage of
several landmark pieces of legislation over the past three and a half
years, the Administration is making once-in-a-generation investments to
accelerate clean energy deployment and fight climate change, rebuild
our nation's crumbling infrastructure, and create millions of good-
paying jobs.
CEQ is proud to play a key role in advancing this work. Within the
Federal government, CEQ's Federal Chief Sustainability Office is
helping Federal agencies lead by example by powering more government
facilities with clean energy, shifting Federal fleets to zero- and low-
emission vehicles, and meeting other objectives that President Biden
set in Executive Order 14057, Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and
Jobs Through Federal Sustainability. We have been pleased to work with
the U.S. Postal Service, for example, as it builds the world's largest
electric delivery vehicle fleet. The Postal Service is currently
planning to transition 66,000 vehicles to electric over the next five
years, which will result in cleaner air in communities and lower costs
for the agency. We are also working with agencies to help them develop
and implement adaptation and resilience plans to better protect Federal
facilities and the communities in which they are located from the
impacts of climate change. We have worked, for example, with the Office
of Science and Technology Policy and the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, to provide agencies and the public with a
new flood mapping tool and a climate risk tool that helps illustrate
climate risks over the years ahead.
CEQ is also helping accelerate the deployment of clean energy and
other vital infrastructure by working to modernize Federal permitting
and environmental review processes. We recognize the need to permit and
build things--quickly and well--to upgrade our transportation
infrastructure, confront the climate crisis, close the digital divide,
bolster our energy security, and advance our industrial policy.
That is why President Biden launched his Permitting Action Plan in
2022, and has directed his Cabinet and senior staff to be directly and
fully engaged to address any delays and bottlenecks in permitting,
simplify and improve permitting processes, and direct appropriate
resources and attention to get projects built well and on time.
The Administration's focus on permitting is delivering results. The
IRA dedicated nearly $1 billion to boost permitting capacity at Federal
agencies. With these investments, we have already expanded the Federal
permitting workforce by 14%, we are incorporating new, more efficient
technology, and we are improving coordination of permitting processes.
In addition to the investments in permitting that the
Administration is making with the help of the IRA, we were also pleased
to work with Congress on a bipartisan basis to enact--as part of the
Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) of 2023--the most significant changes
to NEPA since the law was enacted in 1970. Earlier this month, CEQ
finalized the Bipartisan Permitting Reform Implementation (BPRI) Rule,
which fully implements these bipartisan reforms, as well as additional
reforms that will modernize and accelerate the permitting process.
Altogether, these streamlining efforts will help us drive forward the
infrastructure we need for our future. I will briefly highlight four
major features of these reforms in the BPRI rule.
First, the reforms we made in the BPRI rule will improve the
efficiency and speed of environmental reviews. The rule will accelerate
review of all projects, including clean energy, transmission, clean
water, broadband, transportation, and other crucial infrastructure. It
does so by setting clear deadlines and page limits for environmental
reviews; charging the lead Federal agency for each project with
coordinating a unified and efficient environmental review process;
allowing agencies to share categorical exclusions, which unlocks faster
reviews for projects that do not have significant environmental
effects; establishing new and more flexible methods for agencies to
create categorical exclusions that will speed up projects without
significant adverse effects; expanding the use of programmatic
environmental reviews; and encouraging lower levels of environmental
review when a project's effects can be mitigated.
Second, our reforms in the BPRI rule will facilitate better
environmental outcomes, not by dictating the outcome of any particular
decision-making process, but by improving Federal decision making
across the board. The rule clarifies that agencies should consider
climate change effects in environmental reviews, which courts have
already required agencies to do, look at alternatives that would reduce
a project's climate impacts, and evaluate how to ensure that projects
are designed to withstand climate change. The rule also makes sure that
agencies conduct the proper level of environmental review and that the
review focuses on the most consequential effects of the proposed
action.
Third, the rule advances environmental justice and promotes
meaningful--and early--public input. We know that community buy-in
helps make sure projects are built smart from the start, improving
project design and avoiding conflicts that can result in litigation and
delays.
Fourth and finally, the BPRI rule reverses provisions of a rule,
issued in 2020, that were legally uncertain and jeopardized community
input. Along with steps we took two years ago to clarify and restore
basic safeguards for environmental reviews and guidance we issued to
agencies last year on how to account for climate change and greenhouse
gas emissions, the BPRI rule will help ensure that more projects get
built right the first time.
I am grateful for all the input and comments that helped inform the
BPRI rule. The rule strikes the right balance between expediting the
permitting process and ensuring informed decision making to meet NEPA's
environmental stewardship and national policy goals. It will deliver
more efficiency and certainty for project sponsors, more tools to
Federal agencies, and better projects and decisions for communities.
We are already working with agencies and will continue to do so
over the next year to implement more efficient and effective
environmental reviews as set forth in the BRPI rule. This includes
supporting agencies as they update their NEPA implementing procedures,
develop new categorical exclusions, and strengthen and modernize their
NEPA programs; developing environmental review and permitting trainings
for agency staff; and helping agencies explore technology updates to
make permitting more efficient, including building on the work begun at
the Environmental Permitting Technology and Data Summit that CEQ held
last fall.
Delivering Clean Air, Clean Water, and a Healthy Environment for All
In addition to helping accelerate the deployment of clean energy
and vital infrastructure, CEQ is working to deliver a healthy and safe
environment for all communities. In particular, CEQ is helping Federal
agencies advance polices, programs, and practices to confront long-
standing environmental injustices and inequities and to better protect
people from pollution and environmental harms. This is resulting in
real and meaningful progress in communities across the country.
With President Biden's and Vice President Harris's leadership, CEQ
is supporting Federal agencies' work to address and prevent
disproportionate and adverse environmental and health impacts in
communities--now and in the future. For example, the Environmental
Protection Agency's (EPA) recently finalized standards that will cut
toxic pollution from chemical plants, which will reduce the number of
people at heightened risk for cancer. Additionally, the EPA has
finalized a ban on asbestos and established the first national standard
for PFAS in drinking water.
In addition to the Administration's work to tighten pollution
standards, CEQ is supporting agencies in mobilizing once-in-a-
generation funding and resources from the Inflation Reduction Act and
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to transform our country for the better.
Communities are experiencing the benefits of these historic investments
right now. In rural and urban communities across the nation, former
industrial and energy sites that were once sources of blight and
pollution are being transformed, thanks to new funding to tackle legacy
pollution and remediate environmental harms. This includes investments
to clean up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaim abandoned mine
land, and cap orphaned oil and gas wells. At the same time, we are
working to ensure a future where every child and family lives without
the fear and harmful effects of lead in drinking water by investing
billions of dollars to replace every lead pipe in the country.
As part of the President's commitment to environmental justice, CEQ
is also focused on strengthening government-wide technical assistance
and capacity building, which is helping communities across the country
access these historic resources. The White House Office of
Environmental Justice at CEQ is coordinating implementation of
environmental justice policy across the Federal government, including
delivering on the President's vision for the Justice40 Initiative.
Directed by Executive Order 14008, Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home
and Abroad, the Justice40 Initiative is reshaping how the Federal
government ensures communities that have been historically left behind
and faced underinvestment see the benefits of Federal investments.
There are 518 programs across 19 federal agencies that are currently
being reimagined and transformed through the Justice40 Initiative to
maximize benefits to disadvantaged communities.
Since President Biden signed Executive Order 14096, Revitalizing
Our Nation's Commitment to Environmental Justice for All, last spring,
CEQ has been pleased to work with agencies to conduct assessments of
their environmental justice efforts by developing, implementing, and
updating Environmental Justice Strategic Plans. To promote transparency
and accountability, CEQ published a template for Federal agencies,
drawing on leading practices and recommendations created by government
performance and planning experts. Its purpose is to ensure that
agencies use planning and performance measures that will pave the way
for effective implementation for years to come.
CEQ is also working to improve the information and data that the
Federal government needs to address environmental injustice and to
better protect all communities from the impacts of pollution and
climate change. In particular, CEQ led the development of the Climate
and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST), which Federal agencies use
to identify disadvantaged communities that can benefit from the
Justice40 Initiative. Through partnerships with other Federal agencies
and institutions, CEQ is also working to bolster national data on the
cumulative and disproportionate impacts of climate change, pollution,
environmental, and socioeconomic burdens on disadvantaged communities,
and to help ensure the government uses these data effectively to reduce
burdens and improve outcomes for communities with environmental justice
concerns.
Though much work remains to fulfill the President's vision of clean
air, clean water, and healthy communities for all people, thanks to
these efforts we are seeing real, positive change in communities across
the country.
Supporting Locally Led Conservation and Restoration of our Lands and
Waters
In his first days in office, President Biden established the
country's first national conservation goal to protect, conserve, and
restore at least 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030. To reach
this goal, the Administration launched the America the Beautiful
Initiative, a call to action to conserve and restore the nation's lands
and waters for the benefit of all people through locally led,
voluntary, collaborative conservation efforts.
Since the launch of the America the Beautiful Initiative, the
United States has experienced some of the most rapid conservation
progress in our nation's history, with more than 41 million acres of
land and water conserved in just over three years. This work is
happening at all levels of government. Last month, ten states, eight
Tribes, and 24 local governments became inaugural members of the
Administration's America the Beautiful Freshwater Challenge, which
supports Tribal, state, and local efforts to protect and restore the
nation's lakes, rivers, streams, estuaries, and wetlands.
Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation
Reduction Act, the Administration is investing more than $10 billion to
support locally led conservation and restoration efforts. To help
communities access this historic funding, the Administration launched
Conservation.gov, a new information hub that connects people with tools
to advance meaningful conservation and restoration work on the ground.
Built through an interagency partnership that CEQ helped lead, the
website offers opportunities for the public to learn about conservation
efforts underway across the country, explore outdoor recreation and
volunteer opportunities, and apply for financial assistance in support
of conservation projects.
Conservation.gov also houses the new American Conservation and
Stewardship Atlas, an innovative tool that illustrates locally led,
partnership-driven conservation and restoration work underway in
communities across the nation. The Atlas also includes a preliminary
framework for tracking progress towards the nation's conservation
goals.
The Administration's conservation work includes a wide range of
approaches that meet the needs of communities. This ranges from taking
action to protect 9.3 million acres of the world's largest intact
temperate rainforest in Alaska to planting trees in urban nature-
deprived neighborhoods. It includes working to address long-standing
litigation in the Columbia River Basin and strengthening efforts to
restore salmon to healthy and abundant levels. It also includes
expanding enrollment in working lands programs, as well as withdrawing
sensitive areas--such as the Thompson Divide in Colorado--from future
mineral development. Notably, conservation across the country has been
driven by local efforts of ranchers, farmers, fishers, forest owners,
Tribal Nations, communities, and others to safeguard the health and
integrity of the lands and waters upon which we all depend.
Conclusion
CEQ is proud to be working to deliver a healthy environment for
all, to help conserve and restore our lands and waters, and to
accelerate a clean energy economy that will combat climate change and
make our communities more resilient. Overall, with the FY25 budget
request, CEQ will be well-positioned to help advance the President's
climate, conservation, and environmental justice agenda for our
country.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I look forward to
our continued partnership and welcome any questions you may have.
______
Questions Submitted for the Record to the Hon. Brenda Mallory, Chair,
White House Council on Environmental Quality
The Hon. Brenda Mallory did not submit responses to the Committee by
the appropriate deadline for inclusion in the printed record.
Questions Submitted by Representative Westerman
NEPA Phase 2:
Question 1. Aren't CEQ's Final Phase 2 NEPA Regulations a
significant departure from NEPA's historic role as a procedural
statute?
1a) How can you reconcile Phase 2 and the Administration's imposing
an obligation on Federal agencies to ``use all practicable means'' to
achieve environmental goals with the forty plus years of court cases
saying NEPA doesn't mandate specific results?
Question 2. Does Chevron doctrine or Chevron deference apply to
CEQ?
2a) What is your contingency plan should Chevron be overturned by
the Supreme Court given the divergence between the text of NEPA
amendments contained in the FRA and CEQ's new Phase 2 regulations?
Question 3. The recently finalized NEPA Phase 2 rulemaking appears
to disproportionately favor renewable energy related projects and
discriminate against oil and natural gas projects when the rule should
prompt agencies instead to focus on a project's environmental effects
regardless of energy type.
3a) Explain CEQ's rationale in crafting a rule that has the high
potential to stop the permitting of many critical energy projects in
the U.S. that Americans and overseas allies will need to meet their
growing energy demands in the coming decades--demands for petroleum
products that this administration's own EIA notes will continue to rise
through at least 2050?
30 x 30 Initiative
Question 4. Since President Biden took office, gas prices at the
pump have gone from $1.93 in April 2020 to $3.73 in April 2024. This is
digging into the wallets of the everyday, hardworking American people.
Do you truly think locking up America's lands under the 30x30
initiative from further resource development will help decrease the
price of gas at the pump?
Question 5. CEQ has been restricting access to America's natural
resources the day President Biden took office. The United States
currently imports 51 minerals and 12 are considered ``critical.'' Will
the 30x30 initiative affect foreign dependency on importing our natural
resources?
Question 6. A portion of the 30x30 initiative states that the goal
is to ``create jobs and strengthen the economy,'' but the 30x30
initiative does the complete opposite. The Biden administration has
increased inflation to almost 20 percent and the prices of homes, cars,
groceries, and gas are the highest in our country's history. What has
CEQ done to actually strengthen the economy for the American people?
Global Freshwater Challenge
Question 7. On December 10, 2023, while attending the United
Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28), you announced that the
United States would participate in the Global Freshwater Challenge.
During earth week of this year, the Biden-Harris administration
announced America the Beautiful Freshwater Challenge which, according
to the press release, is intended to ``call on all states and other
governments and entities, including Tribes, interstate organizations,
cities, and local communities to advance their own policies and
strategies for conserving and restoring America's freshwater systems.''
What is the Global Freshwater Challenge? Who is participating in it?
Who funds it?
Question 8. Since this was launched at the United Nations, how is
the UN supporting this initiative? Can you walk the committee through
how the initiative will work? Are there incentives being given to the
participants?
Question 9. What checks are in place to ensure that Foreign
Nationals, foreign groups, or groups which receive funding from the
Chinese Communist Party do not participate in the Global Freshwater
Challenge in the United States?
Executive Order 14072
Question 10. Executive Order 14072 directed the Department of
Agriculture and the Department of the Interior to define, identify, and
inventory so-called mature and old growth forests on Federal land, and
to develop policies to protect these forests. This effort has raised
serious concerns from many stakeholders who believe it will be used to
block forest management activities in areas at a high risk for
catastrophic wildfire. In the face of a historic wildfire crisis, this
is a very understandable concern. Can you provide some clarification on
that front. Is the overall goal of this old growth forest order to
reduce forest management activities, and responsible timber harvests?
Question 11. Evidence shows that the Old Growth order is in fact
being used to reduce forest management and timber harvests. For
instance, in the BLM's FY 2025 Budget Justification, the BLM
specifically justifies a whopping 19 percent reduction in timber volume
in Western Oregon in order to quote ``focus on the protection of mature
and old-growth forests.'' Further reducing timber harvests in an area
that is already struggling with extreme wildfire risk due to overgrown
conditions is deeply misguided. Is it the Administration's position
that drastically reducing timber volume in high-risk areas will help
protect old growth forests?
Marine Sanctuaries & Permitting
Question 12. Within the proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine
Sanctuary there are existing and planned fiber optic networks off the
central California coast. These cables have been determined time and
again to be environmentally benign and become part of the seabed after
they are laid. The US is heavily reliant on subsea fiber optic cables
for global connectivity that is imperative to our national and economic
security. What is CEQ doing to ensure our nation's environmental laws
accommodate our need for the connectivity provided by subsea cables in
the designation of national marine sanctuaries?
Pacific Northwest Hydroelectric Issues
Question 13. The Council on Environmental Quality has been
implementing radical environmental justice initiatives across the
Federal Government, but then seemingly supports the closure of a
hydroelectric dam. How would closing a dam site that does not emit
greenhouse gas emissions increase a clean energy future? Also, are
hydroelectric plants not considered clean energy?
Question 14. Breaching the Lower Snake River Dams only decreases
clean energy production giving the United States more reliance on our
foreign adversaries. Why did you agree that breaching the Lower Snake
River Dams was a good idea?
Question 15. In a statement released by the Biden administration on
the restoration of Pacific Northwest salmon you stated ``Business as
usual will not restore the health and abundance of Pacific Northwest
salmon. We need a durable, inclusive, and regionally-crafted long-term
strategy for the management of the Columbia River Basin.'' The National
Marine Fisheries Service released a report in 2022 admitting that there
is ``uncertainty'' on whether breaching the Lower Snake River Dams
would provide ``direct productivity and survival benefits'' for
``salmon and steelhead stocks.'' As you know, the Department of
Commerce has authority over the NMFS, so do you disagree with the
National Marine Fisheries Service?
Science-Based Targets Initiative
Question 16. Please explain how Science-Based Targets Initiative
(SBTi), a ``partnership between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact
(UNGC), the World Resources Institute (WRI), and the World Wide Fund
for Nature (WWF, also known as the World Wildlife Fund)'' came to be
listed as the primary validation source in the Federal rulemaking
process for the proposed rule, ``Federal Acquisition Regulation:
Disclosure of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate-Related Financial
Risk,'' including the role any employees of CEQ (full time, term,
volunteer, or otherwise) had in the development of this rulemaking.
Question 17. SBTi is not based in the United States. Why didn't CEQ
select a U.S. based non-profit to vet the emissions standards set by
contractors?
Question 18. If this rule is adopted, who will conduct oversight of
SBTi to ensure they are producing accurate scientific estimates?
Question 19. If this rule is adopted, who will conduct oversight of
SBTi to ensure that they are not allowing donations from private actors
influence their decision making?
Questions Submitted by Representative Lamborn
Question 1. Much of your testimony focused on the oversight CEQ is
doing with the NEPA process, specifically touting that you are speeding
up the permitting process. Typically mines in the hardrock mineral
space can take decades to begin production. And this is unacceptable.
Many of the most critical minerals listed on USGS critical minerals
list are ones the US is beholden to China to mine and refine. FAST-41
was created to speed up the NEPA permitting process. Mineral mining was
added to the FAST-41 only a few years ago. Have there been any concerns
that mining companies have been taking advantage of this accelerated
process outside of the intent of the law?
Question 2. FAST-41 was downgraded to only minerals listed on the
Critical Minerals list made by the USGS, which is required to be
updated every 3 years. A Mine might be approved under FAST-41, and
before entering production, already be ineligible for continuing in
that project. Would you concur that many of the green energies the
Administration is prioritizing uses these hardrock minerals, such as
Nickle and Copper in electric vehicles?
Question 3. You specifically mention that your work with the NEPA
Phase II rule is in part to bolster energy security. How do you rectify
the Bipartisan Permitting Reform Implementation Rule's focus on green
energies at the expense of our reliable and affordable producing
energies when Americans are paying the cost at the pump and to maintain
their homes?
Question 4. If the Biden administration is serious about a
transition to an electric future, they must be aware of the amount of
copper alone that is needed. As many as six new large copper mines must
be brought online annually over the next several decades. About 40
percent of the production from new mines will be required for electric
vehicle-related grid upgrades. With all this in mind how does the Biden
administration rectify the fact that we will need to bring on a minimum
of 6 new copper mines a year in order to meet this demand, but they are
also committed to locking up 30 percent of working Federal lands by
2030?
Question 5. In the first 3 years of the Trump administration the
Department held 11 oil and gas lease sales, leasing 221,000 acres,
bringing in $8.8 million in revenue to the state and Federal
Government. In the first 3 years under your control, the Department has
held 1 lease sale in Colorado, leasing one 290 acre parcel, bringing in
$1.2 million in revenue to the State and Federal Government. How are
western states and communities supposed to provide essential services
to their constituents when the Administration is locking up lands and
failing to hold regular lease sales?
Question 6. BLM has one upcoming lease sale in Colorado for a small
parcel of 120 acres. This lease sale along with the only other lease
sale held by this administration neglects the Western Slope. Will your
organization commit to supporting a lease sale on the Western Slope
this year?
Question 7. Some of what you have mentioned in your testimony
focuses on the attention to ``Old growth'' or ``mature forests.''
Currently, the definition of mature forests is nebulous, and as such 63
percent of all USFS lands--91 million acres--would be classified as
such. Additionally, the Forest Service has stated that ``Thinned
forests are healthy forests.'' Through what processes does CEQ intend
to oversee the effort to protect and harden our forests through
wildfire mitigation of wildfire fuel?
Question 8. In the average forest, how is salvage material spread
throughout verdant or otherwise healthy portions of the forest?
Question 9. What do you think are the largest factors holding back
contractors from fulfilling more contracts?
Questions Submitted by Representative Graves
Question 1. The NEPA Phase II guidance requires agencies to
identify the ``environmentally preferable alternative'' even if that
alternative is outside of the scope of the agency's expertise or
authority. Is CEQ, in effect, telling agencies such as the. Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which is a long-standing
technology and fuel-neutral agency, that they have to disregard that
impartiality to pursue the administration's policy agenda? If these
alternatives can be outside of the agency's authority, would this
guidance justify an agency denying an energy infrastructure project in
favor of a purely hypothetical project that has not even been proposed?
In other words, are you saying FERC should deny a needed pipeline in
favor of a wind farm that no one plans to build?
Question 2. It is clear from CEQ's NEPA Phase 2 guidance that the
agency is focused on ensuring that the projects and energy sources you
favor get built, while making it more burdensome to build projects such
as natural gas pipelines. Would CEQ agree that natural gas is a
critical energy resource to support intermittent generation resources?
If so, how does CEQ justify effectively creating a dual track for
review where the projects that the current administration favors are
subject to significantly less review under NEPA than projects that
deliver reliable energy like natural gas pipelines?
Questions Submitted by Representative Radewagen
Question 1. On February 20 during a meeting at the Marriot hotel
with Governor Lemanu and Congresswoman Radewagen, Assistant Secretary
Bavishi agreed there was an ``unusual process here'' as to the rapidity
of this PRIMNM/Sanctuary designation process being conducted; do you
agree with the Assistant Secretary's observation that this PRIMNM
Sanctuary designation has been an ``unusual process here''?
Question 2. Members of The Pacific Remote Islands Coalition stated
in meetings March 7 with my Congressional staff that their clear goal
is to kill all purse seine fishing and shutdown the cannery in American
Samoa in pushing for the PRIMNM/Sanctuary designation they have been
lead sponsor for, do you agree with the Pacific Remote Islands
Coalitions sponsors goals to shut down our cannery in American Samoa?
Question 3. The CEQ, under the Executive Office of the President is
the policy agency for environmental impact statements which drive most
decisions made by the Executive branch. I understand the 2nd draft EIS
for the PRI Sanctuary has been written and is being reviewed by NMFS
and other agencies. When will the draft be made public and does it
include options for commercial fishing?
Question 4. The proposed monument expansion could devastate the
economy of American Samoa, where 80 percent of all private sector jobs
are related to fishing in the region.
4a) Prior to issuance of this decision, what analysis, if any, was
made of the harm expanding the Marine National Monument will have on my
Territory's economy and my constituents?
4b) Can you provide the Committee with a copy of any such analysis?
4c) What measures or strategies have been implemented--or are
contemplated to be implemented--to mitigate these potential harms and
ensure the sustainable growth of both the marine monument and the
fishing industry in the region?
Question 5. Our fisheries must compete with foreign operations
which are often subsidized, and which do not have to meet the stringent
environmental, labor, and other regulatory requirements imposed by the
Federal Government. It's been reported that China is the world's
largest subsidizer of its fishing fleet.
5a) Has CEQ analyzed the benefits Chinese and other foreign fishing
fleets will reap once the National Marine Monument is expanded as is
proposed by President Biden?
5b) Has CEQ conducted any analysis of the environmental impacts
that could occur, should foreign fisheries supplant the U.S. fisheries
in the region?
Questions Submitted by Representative Levin
Question 1. As we look to rapidly build out clean energy and
transmission infrastructure to support a more resilient grid and reduce
energy costs for consumers, based on your experience, what are the most
significant hurdles to the timely processing of Federal permits?
Question 2. How will the Council on Environmental Quality's
``Bipartisan Permitting Reform Implementation Rule'' help to address
existing hurdles on permitting reform?
Question 3. Given the considerable work from Congress through the
Fiscal Responsibility Act, and this Administration through the
``Bipartisan Permitting Reform Implementation Rule'' to address
permitting reform, do you believe additional legislative action is
needed, and if so, what actions should we consider taking to
responsibly speed up permitting while ensuring adequate protections for
impacted communities and our environment?
Question 4. To what extent might additional resources across the
Federal Government help with permit processing times?
Question 5. I appreciate this Administration's focus on improving
opportunities for public engagement and increasing transparency in the
agency decision-making process. Can you compare the projects that have
successfully gone through the permitting process with those that have
struggled due to community opposition? Specifically, is there a
correlation between how actively project sponsors engage with
interested or impacted communities early on or prior to the permitting
process and positive project outcomes? ls there a correlation between a
lack of stakeholder engagement and project delays or even
cancellations?
Questions Submitted by Representative Dingell
Question 1. What were some of the key provisions of the Trump
administration's 2020 NEPA rule that the NEPA Phase 2 rule reverses?
For example, how did the Trump provisions impact public input and
litigation risks?
Question 2. In what ways does the Phase 2 rule protect public
health and ensure better environmental outcomes compared to the Trump
2020 NEPA rule?
Question 3. The Biden administration has taken steps to secure
critical minerals supply chains by joining the Sustainable Critical
Minerals Alliance alongside allied nations. President Biden also
directed Federal agencies to strengthen critical mineral and advanced
battery supply chains with Executive Order 14017. How is CEQ supporting
these efforts to secure our critical mineral supply chains WITHOUT
gutting environmental protections, like some of my Republican
colleagues have proposed?
______
The Chairman. Thank you for your testimony. I will now
recognize Members for 5 minutes of questions, and I will begin
by recognizing myself for 5 minutes.
Chair Mallory, I would like to ask you about some
situations where alternative arrangements under NEPA may be
used. So, yes or no, has CEQ recommended the use of alternative
arrangements for construction of chips facilities, rebuilding
the Francis Scott Key Bridge, or forest management to save
giant sequoias in Yosemite National Park?
Ms. Mallory. Thank you, Congressman, for that. The
alternative arrangements are a tool that we have used for
emergency----
The Chairman. The answer is no. You have not used it for
those projects. But I would like to talk to you about a place
where alternative arrangements have been supported by CEQ.
A year ago, New York Governor Hochul declared a state of
emergency regarding migrants seeking shelter in New York City.
Following months of negotiations with the White House, the City
of New York signed a lease with the National Park Service to
provide shelters and services to migrants using alternative
arrangements. The Committee has investigated this issue and
received two versions of the story. CEQ sent the Committee a
letter stating that they ``did not require DOI to consult with
CEQ on alternative arrangements.'' However, e-mails obtained by
the Committee document CEQ staff directing DOI towards
alternative arrangements. These e-mails also noted support for
the Department's NEPA framework, which provided no opportunity
for public comment.
Do you take full responsibility for forcing DOI to use
alternative arrangements, even though CEQ sent a letter to the
Committee stating you had no position?
Ms. Mallory. Thank you, Congressman, for that question. No,
I think our posture was that we did not----
The Chairman. So, you don't take responsibility for that.
Is a public comment period necessary for turning national park
lands into a migrant camp?
Ms. Mallory. Congressman, that is not an action on which we
have taken any active position.
The Chairman. You have taken an active position. You have
forced DOI to use these alternative arrangements.
At any point during the months of negotiations with
Governor Hochul, which included CEQ's staff to lease Floyd
Bennett Field, did anyone propose a public comment period or
town hall to allow the community a voice?
Ms. Mallory. Congressman, in that case we actually told DOI
that they had regulations that they could follow, that we did
not actually direct them to do anything, and we did not
actually----
The Chairman. We have the e-mails from DOI saying that CEQ
advised them to use alternative arrangements. Do you now
acknowledge that DOI officials based their decision to avoid
public comment or advice from CEQ?
Ms. Mallory. I would like to see the e-mails. I don't
believe that is what we----
The Chairman. We can get you some copies of those.
Without objection, I will submit these e-mails to the
record.


The Chairman. Is avoiding public comment something that CEQ
routinely recommends?
Ms. Mallory. We believe that public comment is important
for actions.
The Chairman. But it wasn't important on that project.
Moving on, in your prepared testimony before the Committee
last year, you spoke about the importance of public engagement
as part of the NEPA process, saying it is among the hallmarks
of democracy and good governance that result in stronger,
smarter, scientifically-supported decisions with benefits for
everyone in the United States. Do you feel that the process of
negotiating the lease for Floyd Bennett Field, waiving NEPA,
and denying public comment serves as an example of a hallmark
of democracy?
Ms. Mallory. Congressman, as I have said, DOI used its
alternative measures because of the circumstance.
The Chairman. At CEQ's direction.
Ms. Mallory. I don't accept that.
The Chairman. I have no problems with emergency procedures
under NEPA. When used appropriately, they are vital. However,
the migrant crisis is an emergency of President Biden's own
making. It is not a natural disaster like a hurricane that
demands an emergency response.
Not only is CEQ carrying out the Biden administration's
failed border policies, you are not playing by your own rules.
On one hand, CEQ is creating complex and unnecessary
regulations for American energy producers, such as a
bureaucratic morass that ultimately benefits our foreign
adversaries when these policies are put in place. And then, on
the other hand, CEQ is advising government agencies to ignore
the input of local communities so that migrants may live rent
free on our national park.
Chair Mallory, I also understand that you have a particular
interest in clean water along our northern border, which is
admirable. However, there are 693 miles of Federal land on the
southern border, with thousands of migrants crossing our
southern border daily, each leaving pounds of trash behind, and
there is a pressing need for action there. We actually held a
hearing there.
Have you been to the southern border to see firsthand the
environmental devastation caused by the Biden border crisis?
Ms. Mallory. I have not.
The Chairman. So, you are very concerned about the northern
border, but you have not even been to the southern border?
Ms. Mallory. I have not been there.
The Chairman. Well, I have been to the southern border, as
well as our Committee. And this is something that has to be
fixed.
As an officer of the President and one of the
Administration's chief stewards of our environment, will you
commit to CEQ developing a whole government plan to address the
immigration and environmental crisis at the southern border?
Ms. Mallory. Congressman, that is an area that is actually
in the domain of the Department of Homeland Security. That is
not a place where I have a role.
The Chairman. Well, the southern border is in crisis, and
your written testimony speaks volumes on environmental justice,
yet does nothing to address the environmental devastation on
Federal lands along our southern border.
I am out of time, and I now recognize the gentleman from
California, Mr. Huffman.
Oh, I am sorry, Ms. Stansbury, the gentlelady from New
Mexico, you are recognized.
Ms. Stansbury. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chair Mallory, it is wonderful to see you.
Ms. Mallory. It is good to see you.
Ms. Stansbury. Thank you so much for being here with us
today. And I want to also thank you, and the White House, and
President Biden for your extraordinary leadership, particularly
on climate and environmental justice issues.
And I want to say a lot of people don't really know about
the Council on Environmental Quality. They don't know about its
history, its role. So, I think it is helpful to take a moment
to share that this Council, which is a part of the executive
office of the President, was created as a White House agency by
Congress in the 1960s on a bipartisan basis under the Nixon
administration. And the reason why they created it is that
Americans understood at that moment that this was not a
partisan issue, that our rivers were on fire, there were toxic
releases that were poisoning our communities, there were
schools that were built on hazardous waste sites, and that our
low-income and tribal communities had been impacted for
generations by decisions for siting and other activities on our
public and community lands.
And we are still dealing with the aftermath of those
decisions today, and that is why the work that you are doing
and your leadership is so important and essential. It is about
righting the wrongs of the past and making sure that we don't
do that again. It is about protecting our special and sacred
places. It is about tackling our energy and our climate crisis,
and it is about making sure that our communities have a real
seat at the table in Federal decisions.
And last year, I had the awesome opportunity to join you,
Madam Chair, as well as our President and a number of officials
in the signing of the President's Executive Order on
environmental justice. And I have to say it was on the Rose
Garden lawn that I had a moment as I was sitting there and I
took it all in, and it really, for me, was a moment of sea
change for our country. It was a moment when we had leaders
from communities, from every state and territory across this
great land, and they finally had a seat at the table. So, I
want to thank you for that work. I think a lot of people don't
understand how profound it is in the arc of our work to bend
our work towards the arc of moral justice.
The issues that New Mexico faces in environmental justice
are real. They have affected our communities for generations.
And in my office, one of the issues that we are dealing with
every single day is around the legacy of our nuclear program.
And Madam Chair, I am sure you are aware that last year
President Biden came to New Mexico as part of his tour of the
Inflation Reduction Act, and he publicly committed to helping
us pass the RECA reauthorization, which would provide just
compensation for our downwinders and uranium miners who have
been impacted by uranium mining and testing of the atomic
weapons in New Mexico.
So, I would love to ask for your commitment once again
today, as our President did, that you will help us. We are
working on a bipartisan basis, but we have to get RECA across
the finish line. Can I get your commitment?
Ms. Mallory. Thank you. Absolutely. I think if the
President has already committed to it, I certainly will be
there in service.
Ms. Stansbury. Thank you. And I hope and I ask that my
colleagues across the aisle here in House Natural Resources
will also support us. Senator Hawley is leading this effort in
the Senate, and we need your help and support. We have to get
it done. We have people dying because of it.
The second issue that is related to this is that we are
currently working with the NNSA and Department of Energy
overall, as well as DOD, to address unexploded ordnance. Our
pueblos and tribes, during especially the Manhattan era and the
decades after, essentially were used as shooting ranges for the
testing of both nuclear shell bombs, as well as other
ordinances. And many of these dangerous materials still have
not been cleaned up on those lands. We still have tailings
piles from uranium mines on our lands, and there is a complete
lack of coordination between the NNSA and DOD. We have great
leaders in those organizations, but the bureaucracy is grinding
our communities down.
So, the other question and commitment I would love to ask
you today is will CEQ please help our communities in getting
coordination across these agencies to clean up these materials?
Ms. Mallory. Thank you for that, Congresswoman. I will
actually investigate this and see what role we are already
playing, and if there is any assistance we can provide.
Ms. Stansbury. Wonderful. Thank you.
With that, I yield back.
The Chairman. The gentlelady yields back. The Chair
recognizes the gentlelady from Wyoming, Ms. Hageman, for 5
minutes.
Ms. Hageman. Good morning, and thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Director Mallory, on April 30, the Council on Environmental
Quality finalized its revisions to the NEPA regulations
codifying climate change and environmental justice principles
for NEPA purposes, including a definition of environmental
justice. ``Environmental justice,'' according to the CEQ, means
``just treatment and meaningful involvement of all people,
regardless of income, race, color, national origin, tribal
affiliation, or disability in agency decision-making and other
Federal activities that affect human health and the environment
so that people are: (1) fully protected from disproportionate
and adverse human health and environmental effects, including
risks and hazards including those related to climate change,
the cumulative impacts of environmental and other burdens in
the legacy of racism, or other structural or systemic barriers;
and (2) have equitable access to a healthy, sustainable, and
resilient environment in which to live, play, work, learn,
grow, worship, and engage in cultural subsistence practices.''
The very Executive Order coming from President Biden that
you are using to expand the NEPA process creates greater
reliance on foreign countries with hardly any environmental or
even child labor laws. Could you please explain to me where is
the environmental justice in children in the Congo mining
cobalt and other minerals for EV batteries, when this
Administration is doing everything it can to ban mining in the
United States?
Ms. Mallory. Thank you, Congresswoman, for that question.
I think that we are actually doing everything that we can
to make mining possible in the United States in places where it
is appropriate.
Ms. Hageman. Actually, the BLM just came out with an order
yesterday related to Wyoming that essentially bans mining in
the northern part of the state. So, that is not accurate.
Previous to the development of this definition, what laws
prevented any person, regardless of race, color, national
origin, or tribal affiliation from participating in the public
processes such as NEPA?
Ms. Mallory. The issue that we are addressing,
Congresswoman, is that, despite laws that would make it
possible that, in fact, these things weren't happening, so the
executive----
Ms. Hageman. Well, my question is were there any laws that
prevented these various groups from being able to participate
in the process. It is a very simple question. Are you aware of
any laws prior to your definition that prevented people that
you have identified from being able to participate in the
process?
Ms. Mallory. What I am saying, Congresswoman, is that the
laws were not the problem. The problem is the practice.
Ms. Hageman. OK, so there weren't any laws. In fact, the
answer is that under the law all people, regardless of race,
color, national origin, or tribal affiliation are entitled to
and encouraged to participate in public processes impacting our
natural resources in our Federal lands, aren't they?
Ms. Mallory. They are, but that is not the reality.
Ms. Hageman. OK. Can you give me an example when you say--
--
Ms. Mallory. Oh, many examples. I mean, I think the problem
is that when you actually set up a permitting or an engagement
process that doesn't take into account that you are in a ritual
season where people can't get there, or Alaska Natives can't
arrive, those are examples of where you are not giving
thoughtful----
Ms. Hageman. But can you give me a specific example of
where that has occurred?
Ms. Mallory. I can't today. But we can certainly provide
that.
Ms. Hageman. OK. We are seeing Federal agencies issue
regulations that cripple the communities they are supposed to
be protecting. As Wyoming's sole Representative, I can attest
to the fact that the Federal Government is creating greater
economic uncertainty through its radical environmental agenda
for all races, for all genders, for all people. We are seeing
attacks on states with large amounts of Federal land as
tightening restrictions impact their ability to generate
revenue for essential services.
Director Mallory, last June, you highlighted in your
testimony that the Biden administration provided more than $1
billion to ``make sure that agencies have the environmental
review and permitting experts they need.'' While I agree with
you that personnel can be a serious cause for delays, it isn't
the main problem. I have seen permit modifications in my
district essentially go through the NEPA process three or four
times, and get up hung up on a single solicitor's review.
Do you agree that duplication within NEPA is a significant
roadblock in the permitting process?
Ms. Mallory. Thank you, Congresswoman, for that. We have
been focused on making sure that the processes are not
duplicative.
Ms. Hageman. But they are. So, what are you doing to take
care of and address the duplication that we see basically on a
daily basis?
Ms. Mallory. The new rules that we just released actually
focus on making sure that we align the processes across state
and local governments.
Ms. Hageman. Would you agree, Chairman Mallory, that low-
income communities are disproportionately impacted by policies
that raise energy prices?
Ms. Mallory. Congressman, yes, that is an issue that the
Administration has been very focused on.
Ms. Hageman. Thank you.
I yield back.
The Chairman. The gentlelady yields back. The Chair
recognizes Ms. Kamlager-Dove for 5 minutes.
Ms. Kamlager-Dove. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
And thank you again, Chairwoman, for showing up today. I
have a few questions for you.
How are you working to ensure the 40 percent of the
Justice40 monies are getting to EJ communities?
Ms. Mallory. Thank you, Congresswoman, for that question. I
think that is a very important part of the work that we are
doing, and it has a number of key aspects to it.
No. 1, as you know, the President created the White House
Environmental Justice Advisory Council as a body that we use
and rely on to make sure that we are getting information from
experts in the community who understand what is happening on
the ground. So, that is a very important resource.
No. 2, we created the White House Interagency Council,
which also is very much focused on ensuring that across all
agencies there are senior-level people who are focused on
environmental justice and how it is impacting their programs.
And we rely on them in our activities as we try to make sure
that people in the communities are getting the technical
assistance that they need in order to be able to take advantage
of some of the opportunities that exist.
One of the things that we have been doing, and something
that we call the kind of White House environmental justice
campaign, is going out to communities across the country and,
in particular, looking at places where state, local, and
Federal entities are sort of coming together around projects
that are going to have benefits for communities that have been
disproportionately disadvantaged. And we have used our
scorecard, which was also required by the President's Executive
Order at the beginning of the Administration to set sort of a
preliminary analysis on how dollars are actually reaching
communities and are impacting folks on the ground.
Ms. Kamlager-Dove. Thank you for that. It sounds a lot like
you are committed to equity. Yet, I happen to be in another
committee, not this one, and I heard a Republican colleague say
that equity was a dirty word. So, then I had to look it up in
the dictionary because I was trying to figure out what happened
to this word. And it said, ``fair and impartial,'' or ``the
value of a stock.'' So, I was wondering how all of a sudden
impartiality and fairness became dirty words, but I digress.
How does the Phase 2 rule define and incorporate
environmental justice considerations into NEPA regulations?
Ms. Mallory. Thank you so much for that question.
One of the things that we do in the rule is to identify the
environmental justice climate change impacts as impacts that
should be recognized as agencies are doing their environmental
reviews, so that the rule actually talks about it as among the
reasonably foreseeable effects that should be taken into
consideration, and it calls for the creation of a public
engagement officer specifically focused on ensuring that all
communities are having the opportunity to participate in
processes, and that we are setting them up in ways that
recognize what their hurdles may be, what barriers there may
be.
And it also says to agencies, as you are thinking about the
reasonable range of alternatives that you should consider, you
should also envision how you might reduce the impacts or
burdens on communities and climate change.
Ms. Kamlager-Dove. Thank you. At a prior hearing held by
this Committee about CEQ and NEPA, Professor Pleune, a scholar
of NEPA and a co-author on several seminal papers on the topic
of permitting, testified that NEPA can accelerate major
projects by providing a way for stakeholders to get together
early in the process and work out differences before they
become intractable. Is this consistent with your experience?
Ms. Mallory. Absolutely, and that is why we emphasize early
and often engagement as part of the process.
Ms. Kamlager-Dove. We say that where I am from, too: early
and often.
Lastly, what are some other provisions in the Phase 2 rule
that can improve permitting time and accelerate projects?
Ms. Mallory. Thank you so much for that question. I mean,
there are a couple of key ones.
There are those that were implemented as part of the Fiscal
Responsibility Act, which includes specific deadlines, that
includes page limits, that includes coordination mechanisms
around the agencies with a focus on having a lead agency who is
leading activities.
There are the provisions that allow for categorical
exclusions to be shared across the Federal Government. We then
took that a step further in beyond what the Fiscal
Responsibility Act provided for by creating new mechanisms in
which categorical exclusions can be introduced through
programmatic agreements or through some of the planning
measures.
It also emphasizes the value of programmatic agreements and
the importance of using that as a way to shorten what might be
an individual project review.
Ms. Kamlager-Dove. Thank you.
Thank you so much, Mr. Chair, I yield back.
The Chairman. The gentlelady yields back. The Chair
recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota, the Chair of the
Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources, Mr. Stauber.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Chair Mallory, thank you for coming before us today. I will
say that you had talked about this Administration wanting to
work and consult with the citizens of this country. I can tell
you for sure that they did not engage with the Native tribes on
the North Slope or the community in reference to their ANWR and
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, Alaska. And I know that because
they sat in that same chair and told us they were never
consulted.
I was really incredibly frustrated to see the final NEPA
Phase 2 that the Biden administration published a couple of
weeks ago. It is clear this Administration has not held up its
end of the bargain. This Administration, including your office,
has completely ignored the reforms Congress included in the
Fiscal Responsibility Act. Plain and simple, this
Administration is not following the law, a law that President
Biden signed, I should add.
When it became apparent this would be the case last year, I
authored an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2024 Interior
appropriations bill last year, blocking the Administration's
NEPA Phase 2 rulemaking. This amendment, along with my parallel
amendment blocking the NEPA Phase 1 rulemaking, were both
agreed to by the House by voice vote, and included in the final
bill that cleared the House last November.
I want to thank my good friend, Representative Graves from
Louisiana, and I am proud to co-sponsor his impending CRA
disapproval resolution to block this Phase 2 rule.
One of the greatest issues I have with the Phase 2 rule,
Chair Mallory, is the fact that it will result in increased
litigation. And I am especially concerned that you struck from
the regulation language that clarified the purpose of NEPA is
not to generate litigation. Why was this removed from the
regulation?
And were you directed by the White House to write the rule
in a way that it would encourage more litigation and help stop
important infrastructure and development projects?
Ms. Mallory. Thank you for that question.
I think, first of all, I just want to say that we believe
that the rule fully implements the Fiscal Responsibility law,
almost provision by provision, almost word for word.
Mr. Stauber. It doesn't, but go ahead.
Ms. Mallory. We will disagree on that.
And second, as to specific litigation provisions, I am
actually not familiar with the one that you are talking about.
But our view was that there are things that we have
responsibility for as an agency, or that the agencies have
responsibility for, and there are things that the courts have
responsibility for. And we tried to be clear about what we
actually controlled.
Mr. Stauber. In the Phase 2 rule, you removed the text
stating that NEPA is a procedural statute and instead replaced
it with the following: ``NEPA is the basic national charter for
protection of the environment.''
Real quick, what does the acronym NEPA stand for?
Ms. Mallory. National Environmental Policy Act.
Mr. Stauber. OK. How many times is the word ``protection''
used in the underlying statute from 1970?
Ms. Mallory. I haven't done that calculation.
Mr. Stauber. Zero. This is the 5-page statute from 1970,
NEPA. These are your regulations. These are all your
regulations from a 5-page statute to all your regulations. Do
you think there is government creep?
This is what the American people are concerned about, Madam
Chair. Mind you, the original statute refers to procedure or
procedures. Multiple times.
Mr. Chairman, I would like to provide some additional
context. This, the original statute, it is just 5 pages long,
and I want to enter that into this record.
The Chairman. Without objection.
Mr. Stauber. Over the past five decades, NEPA has grown
into a mammoth, mammoth document. The Biden administration's
Phase 2 rule, again, 136 pages from 5, your Administration, 136
pages. It is clear that NEPA has grown out of control.
These regulations represent a significant departure from
NEPA's historic role as a procedural statute. It appears that
CEQ is attempting to rewrite statute through regulation. We
have to bring that back to the Members of Congress. Your
rulemaking and others' has to stop. It is devastating for our
communities, devastating to extract natural resources. It is
devastating.
Chair Mallory, the finalized NEPA Phase 2 rule appears to
favor renewable energy projects and discriminate against oil,
natural gas, or mineral development projects. I am
disappointed.
I yield back.
The Chairman. The gentleman yields back. The Chair
recognizes the gentlelady from Alaska, Mrs. Peltola.
Mrs. Peltola. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Welcome. My question is about Alaska. I represent Alaska,
and we have just seen decision after decision coming out of
this Administration in recent months, probably the last year,
that have been very injurious, honestly, to Alaska resource
development. And as the Representative for all Alaska, every
time I hear one of these new decisions it sets me back on my
heels. There is no advanced warning to my office on many of the
decisions that have come out of this Administration.
And I am wondering if you can please tell me what your
overall strategy is for resource development in Alaska. We are
not a snow globe. I just want to say that.
Ms. Mallory. Thank you, Congresswoman, for that question.
I think where Alaska comes into play, obviously, it is a
very important and strategic location. It is also one that has
tremendous, both environmental and ecological value, and it has
challenges, just given its location in how we can best meet the
needs of the people there. And I think we are focused on trying
to really balance all of those things as the Administration is
looking at various policies.
Mrs. Peltola. It does not feel very balanced from this
Alaskan's perspective.
And I have to laugh when I hear that this Administration is
concerned about racial justice, because it does not feel to me,
as an Alaska Native, that this Administration listens to Alaska
Natives.
I know it was mentioned a moment ago, but when there was an
opportunity presented for public input, it was very
strategically timed to coincide with the spring whale hunt of
the Inupiat people, and they were completely precluded from
that public comment period on their own lands, lands that had
been in their families for generations. They have never lived
anywhere else. These are their lands. And when a rule was put
forth by this Administration, they actually intentionally timed
it to coincide with a period when they knew Inupiat people
would not be next to a fax machine, or within cell range, or
with Internet service. So, I just am very frustrated.
I am not going to give you any gotcha questions, or present
you with a question and then not allow you to respond. That is
a favorite trick, I think, of many people in Congress and I
find it really rude. I really am wanting to hear your comment
on my frustration as an Alaska Native.
Ms. Mallory. Yes, well, thank you, Congresswoman. I really
appreciate that, and I appreciate you sharing it.
The specific circumstance that you are describing, I can't
really speak directly to. I know the Department of the Interior
was very much trying to make sure that they were taking in and
creating an opportunity for all of the folks who were going to
be directly impacted to participate, and even added additional
timelines on some of the comment periods. I don't know if it is
the one that you are specifically referring to.
But I do think that it is an important part of trying to
make sure that we are hearing from everyone and giving every
community, including Alaska Natives, which I think have
particular challenges that we are aware of and are trying to
work to address.
Mrs. Peltola. So, after the fact, after the comment period
was almost over and we were asking for an extension so people
could respond who are from that region, I basically had to
trick the Department of the Interior to have an audience, for
Inupiat people to have an audience with the Department of the
Interior. As a Congressman, I had to set up a meeting, and then
I brought 12 Eskimos with me because they could not get an
appointment. I shouldn't have to trick this Administration into
meeting with people from my state.
So, I am, like, 100 different kinds of enraged about the
situation in Alaska right now because it seems like at least
twice a week there is something injurious to Alaskans and our
ability to pay our bills. Over 80 percent of the way that the
state of Alaska pays its bills is from oil royalties. We have
to get mines on-line. We have to develop new oil fields in
order to meet our constitutional requirements as a state. And
this Administration is tying two arms and two legs behind our
back.
So, I appreciate you being here. I appreciate the work you
do, but I am extremely frustrated with this Administration.
The Chairman. The gentlelady's time has expired. The Chair
recognizes the gentleman from Oregon, the Chair of the
Committee on Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife and Fisheries, Mr.
Bentz.
Mr. Bentz. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you for being here today. I am looking at your letter
of February 7, 2024 to me in response to a letter that I had
sent with the co-Chair of the Subcommittee on the
Administrative State over in Judiciary, on which I also sit.
So, I have your response. Before I go to it, I would like you
to share with us in a little more detail how much budget your
organization has. I know you say $4 million, but it is
considerably more than that. Can you share with us what the
funds are that you have available?
Ms. Mallory. Yes. Right now, Congressman, the request that
is in the President's budget is for $4.6 million. We were also
allocated $62.5 million in the Inflation Reduction Act that we
are in the process of adding to Fiscal Year 2026. And we are in
the process of spending that.
Mr. Bentz. And on what?
Ms. Mallory. The Inflation Reduction Act actually directs
us in specific areas.
The first is towards permitting and environmental review,
which allows for funding on staffing, resources, and
technology.
The second, the $32.5 million, is for environmental justice
data-related expenses, which includes the climate and economic
justice screening tool, the Environmental Justice Scorecard,
and related staffing. So, those are the big buckets associated
with that.
Mr. Bentz. And I appreciate that. I just wanted to call out
the numbers of employees. Perhaps you can share with us how
many people are employed by the CEQ.
Ms. Mallory. There are full-time employees who CEQ funds,
approximately 50 employees. We have arrangements where there
are temporary assignments from other Federal agencies for about
35 employees.
Mr. Bentz. Yes, I am looking at the list right here. There
are 28 on page 1; 31 employees on page 2; 31 employees on page
3; and 13 employees on page 4. How does this compare to your
predecessor's number of employees for CEQ?
Ms. Mallory. Over time, CEQ's staffing has actually
changed. When it first started, it was on the order of about
100 people a year. In the recent years----
Mr. Bentz. Yes, your predecessor. My understanding is it
was an extremely modest number, and now it has gone up to
closer to 60 to 70. It seems like a massive increase.
But what I was most interested in is the foundation for
what it is you do. And I was looking at your mission statement,
and there are many different statutes called out on, it is the
mission statement and background of the CEQ. I am having a hard
time finding, though, the exact language that gives you the
power to do some of the things you have been doing. And this
is, of course, why we wrote you the letter, Chair Massie and I,
some months ago, asking where in the world you found the power
and authority to do what, you say here in the second paragraph
of your letter dated September 7, may I offer this?
The Chairman. Without objection.
Mr. Bentz. The second paragraph reads, ``In 2022, CEQ
convened an inter-agency group that worked to resolve a long-
standing litigation in Federal court over operation of the
Columbia River system.'' Where does that authority come from?
Ms. Mallory. Congressman, we have had authority since the
beginning to actually work across inter-agency matters that are
complicated and require some coordination.
Mr. Bentz. Tell me the source of the authority.
Ms. Mallory. The source of the authority is under the
statute itself that has us advising the President; and under
the Environmental Quality Act, which is related to the NEPA
statute, it identifies hiring the necessary staff for----
Mr. Bentz. Wait, wait. It says you are advising the
President. It never says anything about going out and actually
participating.
The reason I am so interested in this, are you subject to
the APA? Is the CEQ subject to the APA?
Ms. Mallory. Yes.
Mr. Bentz. How? If we were unhappy with what you did, how
do we challenge you?
Ms. Mallory. When we do rulemaking, we have to go through
the APA process.
Mr. Bentz. Well, wait. This is not rulemaking.
Ms. Mallory. Not correct.
Mr. Bentz. How do I challenge what you did, if you are not
subject to the APA? And you are not. Because I don't think you
have the authority to do this. But how do I challenge you in
the event that I am right, or you are right, that you somehow
are challengeable? Tell me.
Ms. Mallory. I think you would challenge through normal
administrative and congressional oversight.
Mr. Bentz. Oh, you mean what we are doing right now?
Ms. Mallory. What you are doing right now.
Mr. Bentz. Yes, really. So, you are responding to me and
saying this is the only way that we can address what we believe
the CEQ is doing inappropriately is what I am doing right now.
Is that what you are saying?
Ms. Mallory. It depends on what the action is. If there is
an actual Federal action that is going to occur, it comes from
a normal process.
Mr. Bentz. So, what you say here in the same second
paragraph is a commitment to work with regional stakeholders to
develop a long-term, durable solution to restore salmon and
other native fish populations in the interior basin, that is
the Columbia River basin, to healthy and abundant levels.
Where does that standard come from?
Ms. Mallory. The standard was actually developed by a
Federal task force that the region put together. It was a
regional task force.
Mr. Bentz. And that report is not even signed by a Federal
group.
I yield back.
The Chairman. The gentleman yields back. The Chair
recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. Huffman, for 5
minutes.
Mr. Huffman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Welcome, Chair Mallory. It is great to see you, and I
appreciate all the great work that you do.
A little bit earlier the Chairman asked you some, I guess
you could call them questions. They seemed a lot more like
statements, and you weren't allowed to give much of an answer.
But at least the Chairman is here, and some of his
colleagues are here. Some of our colleagues across the aisle
have decided to be in New York today to take part in the
spectacle of the great philandering leader and his criminal
trial. But it is good to see that some people have a little
dignity and are willing to be part of a congressional hearing
today.
At any event, you were asked about whether you had forced
the Department, literally the Chairman's words, forced the
Department of the Interior to use alternative measures under
NEPA with respect to Gateway National Park. And although you
weren't allowed a chance to really respond to that, I want to
give you that chance now.
And I actually have the e-mail that the Chairman entered
into the record. I have read it. There is nothing in this e-
mail that supports the proposition that you somehow forced
Interior to do anything. It begins by thanking the Department
of the Interior for approaching CEQ for guidance, and it then
leaves open various possible pathways for the Department of the
Interior to consider and pursue, and expresses your support for
them doing so.
Do you want to tell us the story of what happened there?
Ms. Mallory. Yes. Actually, what happened is they called us
up to ask whether or not there was any particular process that
they needed to follow. And we talked to them, and they shared
what their regulations allowed. And because their regulations
provided for a path for them to move forward, we said, well, we
don't really need to do anything, you can just abide by your
own regulations. That was really the extent of it. And I think
that is what we reflected in the letter that we presented to
the Congressman.
Mr. Huffman. I think the Chairman is giving hyperbole a bad
name by suggesting that this e-mail somehow forced the
Department, or anything you did forced the Department to do
anything.
By the way, do you have the authority to force the
Department of the Interior to do anything?
Ms. Mallory. No, I don't have that authority. Sometimes I
wish I did.
Mr. Huffman. Wouldn't it be nice if all of us had such
authority, yes.
Ms. Mallory. Wouldn't it be nice?
Mr. Huffman. So, you have also been asked a lot about the
Fiscal Responsibility Act. And there is a disconnect,
certainly, between some of the hype that my friends across the
aisle have attributed to the changes to NEPA that were called
for in the Fiscal Responsibility Act and the reality of those
changes. I have read them. And it is much less significant if
you actually just read them and think about the modest changes
that the Fiscal Responsibility Act put in place. We are talking
about time and page limits for NEPA reviews. And, of course,
you incorporate that in your NEPA 2.0 rulemaking. Correct?
Ms. Mallory. Correct.
Mr. Huffman. There are also provisions about the timelines
for when agencies can tier to an existing programmatic
analysis. That is in there, too?
Ms. Mallory. Correct.
Mr. Huffman. Provisions about agencies using categorical
exclusions. That is in there, too?
Ms. Mallory. Correct.
Mr. Huffman. Although you have added some common-sense
sideboards, no one would suggest you can use a categorical
exclusion from another agency that is not similar to the
project you are considering. And you have addressed that,
right?
Ms. Mallory. Correct.
Mr. Huffman. There is a provision that permits contractors
and project applicants to prepare their own environmental
reviews. And you haven't done any violence to that in your NEPA
2.0.
Ms. Mallory. Correct.
Mr. Huffman. There is a clarification about the continued
applicability of conflict of interest requirements subject to
agency approval. That is all in there, too?
Ms. Mallory. Correct.
Mr. Huffman. And then there is the question of major
Federal action. And the bottom line is there is nothing in
implementing these various provisions from the Fiscal
Responsibility Act that says you can't do anything else in your
NEPA 2.0 rulemaking, right?
Ms. Mallory. That is correct.
Mr. Huffman. It doesn't say you can't consider
environmental justice, you can't go back and fix illegal or
inappropriate guidance that the Trump administration had
issued.
Tell us a little bit more about how your NEPA 2.0
rulemaking actually complies with the Fiscal Responsibility
Act, but also cleans up some other messes.
Ms. Mallory. Yes, thank you for that. And I think you just
went through a number of the key points that were in the Fiscal
Responsibility Act. And we were very intentional about making
sure that all of those are there, they are incorporated into
the program.
We felt like we had to deal with accelerating the
timelines. We had to deal with accelerating the process. We did
that. The Fiscal Responsibility helps us.
We had to actually make sure that one of the key
environmental problems that we are facing today, which is
climate change, is recognized in the rules and incorporated.
And, similarly, environmental justice areas are a place
where we know that we have failed our environmental programs,
and we had to make sure that that was included.
But then finally, there were several provisions that we
thought put the agencies at risk because the previous
administration had put in place provisions that were uncertain.
They created greater uncertainty and flexibility, and we
removed those.
The Chairman. All right. Thank you, Madam Chairman.
I yield back.
The Chairman. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now
recognizes the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Federal Lands,
Mr. Tiffany from Wisconsin.
Mr. Tiffany. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I would
just gently chide my colleague from California. It seems there
are a lot more members on this side of the dais than there are
the other. I am not sure where the criticism is coming from.
I want to know what that trick is, Chair Mallory. I want to
know what that trick is that the gentlelady from Alaska has to
be able to get people from this Administration to be able to
come to our districts and listen to what is happening in rural
America.
With the agencies that you work with and the people that
you work with, do you say to them, ``Make sure that you are
coordinating with local and state municipalities?''
Ms. Mallory. Yes, well, that is actually sort of a very key
part of what the National Environmental Policy Act envisions.
Mr. Tiffany. Yes. Are the agencies doing that?
Ms. Mallory. I believe that they are, generally. I can't
speak to any specific circumstance, but I believe that we all
are operating on the assumption that the closer you are to the
ground, the better you are in terms of getting the kind of
information that is important.
Mr. Tiffany. Let's go to the gentlelady from Alaska with
her example. Do you think that they coordinated with those
tribes?
And think about it, this Administration, and we were here
yesterday with a couple of members of the Administration that
said, oh, we do everything to work with tribes, we have
elevated it, we make sure that we work with tribes. You are not
working with the tribes up in Alaska is what we are hearing,
including from the other side of the aisle.
Ms. Mallory. I appreciate the Congresswoman's comment. I
know I personally met with the folks from the North Slope. I
know that the Department----
Mr. Tiffany. They asked for an extension, Chair Mallory,
and they were not given it. Do you go back to these people at
Interior and say to them, hey, and it is obvious, you are very
well spoken in regards to NEPA and understanding the
coordination requirement. They are not doing it, are they?
Ms. Mallory. I actually can't agree with that, Congressman.
I know that they actually reached out and met with folks on
that matter.
The Chairman. Did they sit down and treat them as equals at
the table?
Ms. Mallory. I can't speak to what happened in the
settings.
Mr. Tiffany. You can tell they didn't treat them as equals
because they went and shut off more land in Alaska that these
people, the Native tribes, did not want to have. They clearly
did not coordinate.
Ms. Mallory. Well, Congressman, I think you have to
recognize we were also hearing from people in Alaska about
subsistence protections.
Mr. Tiffany. No, you are hearing----
Ms. Mallory. That is also part of that.
Mr. Tiffany. You are hearing from the tall office buildings
of the corporate environmentalists in San Francisco.
Ms. Mallory. We are hearing from people on the ground.
Mr. Tiffany. That is who you are hearing from.
Ms. Mallory. No, we are hearing from people on the ground.
Mr. Tiffany. And the people who fund those campaigns on
that side of the aisle.
Ms. Mallory. People on the ground.
Mr. Tiffany. Are you doing a review of how many endangered
species are being killed by wind turbines and solar panels as
part of the NEPA process when those are going up on Federal
lands?
Ms. Mallory. I think when the windmills are being analyzed,
that part of the analysis will include impacts to species.
Mr. Tiffany. You think or you know?
Ms. Mallory. I mean, I am sure that would be normal, if
there were species that are present.
Mr. Tiffany. And it is OK to be killing endangered species.
Ms. Mallory. It is not OK. There is a process to examine
that and determine what is appropriate.
Mr. Tiffany. But that is what is happening.
Ms. Mallory. Well, we can talk about specific circumstances
if you want, but I know that the agencies are working so that
that is not happening.
Mr. Tiffany. In your written testimony you said, ``We must
slash the greenhouse gas emissions that are warming our climate
and the toxic pollution that imperils our communities.'' What
percentage of global emissions come from the United States?
Ms. Mallory. I actually don't have that in front of me.
Mr. Tiffany. And that is fine. I will share the answer. It
is less than 15 percent.
Do your rules apply to China?
Ms. Mallory. No.
Mr. Tiffany. Does China play by our rules of the Western
world?
Ms. Mallory. As we saw just this week, the President
believes that they are not, and has taken some steps to address
that.
Mr. Tiffany. Has China failed at environmental justice?
Ms. Mallory. I am not tracking China's behavior.
Mr. Tiffany. So, why should we diminish America, as what is
happening, whether it is mining, whether it is drilling for
oil, natural gas, agriculture is in the crosshairs at this
point, why should we diminish America when China does not have
to play by the rules? Doesn't that ultimately lead to a decline
in America?
Ms. Mallory. Yes, I mean, Congressman, we are very much
focused on trying to position ourselves so that we can actually
compete with China.
Mr. Tiffany. I will just close with this, Mr. Chairman.
This is a war on rural America that is going on with the Biden
administration. We see it every day. And we are deciding right
now, in the 2020s, is the 21st century going to be a Chinese
century or an American century? With these types of actions
that are going on, I am not real optimistic. I yield back.
The Chairman. The gentleman yields back.
Ms. Kamlager-Dove. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to
enter into the record a list of a dozen court cases that
clearly say the National Environmental Policy Act requires the
Federal Government to consider the impacts of climate change
for proposed projects. The Trump administration ignored this
legal obligation and lost case after case and CEQ's Phase 2
rule updates CEQ's NEPA regulations to reflect this case law.
The Chairman. Without objection, the court cases can be
added.

12 Climate Wins From the National Environmental Policy Act
The National Environmental Policy Act requires the federal government
to consider the impacts of climate change for proposed projects. The
Trump administration has dismissed this condition--and it has come back
to haunt them in the courts.

In March 2017, President Donald Trump directed the White House Council
on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to rescind its previous guidance that
showed federal agencies how to consider the effects of climate change
in their decision-making. The Obama administration's CEQ issued this
climate guidance in 2016 in response to court decisions that determined
that the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) required agencies to
calculate changes in carbon pollution that would result from major
federal projects. Rescinding this guidance was typical of Trump's pro-
fossil fuel, anti-climate agenda, which has since included withdrawing
the United States from the Paris climate agreement, rolling back the
Clean Power Plan, and undermining common-sense clean car standards.
But now, more than two years and at least 12 court losses later, it's
clear: Rescinding the CEQ's climate guidance was misguided,
ineffective, and ironically counterproductive to the Trump
administration's professed ``energy dominance'' agenda. In their effort
to cut through what they perceived as red tape, the Trump
administration merely created more uncertainty in federal permitting
for industry, which has ultimately slowed fossil fuel development
across the country.
This column first discusses the history of NEPA, the bedrock
environmental law that requires that climate effects be considered in
federal decision-making. It then includes a brief summary of 12 court
cases during the Trump administration in which NEPA upheld the
requirement for federal agencies to consider projects' environmental
consequences. These cases all point to one thing: The federal
government needs to issue new guidance on how to consider climate
impacts under NEPA.
Climate consideration under NEPA
With the passage of NEPA in 1969, Congress recognized the ``profound
impact of man's activity'' on the natural environment. For the first
time, there existed a mandate for how people and nature could ``exist
in productive harmony'' for current and future generations. NEPA is
also one of the only statutes that allows for public participation and
input into major federal decisions, and it remains a critically
important way for communities to have their voices heard.
Under NEPA, federal agencies are required to consider and disclose the
potential effects of their actions on the surrounding environment.
Thanks to court rulings centering on NEPA's climate consideration
requirements, the Obama administration issued climate guidance in 2016
to supplement how federal agencies conduct environmental reviews as
required under NEPA. This guidance sought for the first time to
clarify, for the suite of federal agencies, how to consider potential
greenhouse gas emissions from federal projects under the NEPA process
and to provide a consistent approach across agencies. Prior to the
guidance's existence, each agency considered changes in carbon
pollution differently, and some did not consider it at all. With the
guidance, however, industries applying for federal permits--such as the
oil and gas industry--could be sure that agencies were taking a
consistent approach in their environmental review.
Upon entering office, President Trump rescinded this guidance in a
sweeping executive order designed to stop federal agencies from
disclosing how the government's actions contribute to climate change.
Since this decision, however, federal courts have repeatedly held that
NEPA does require the federal government to consider the effects of a
project's carbon pollution when proceeding with major federal actions
such as leasing public lands for drilling to oil and gas companies or
issuing permits to industry to build pipelines.
As the Trump administration continues its efforts to bolster fossil
fuels as part of its ``energy dominance'' agenda, NEPA has been one of
its strongest legal roadblocks. Recently, for example, former oil and
gas lobbyist and current U.S. Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt
begrudgingly conceded to members of the House Committee on Natural
Resources that NEPA requires his agency, among others, to consider the
effects of climate change.
When President Trump withdrew the CEQ climate guidance, his
administration set itself up to fail in the courts--and that's exactly
what has occurred. Even the fossil fuel industry has asked for the
guidance. Time and time again, courts are ordering agencies to consider
the effects of climate change in their environmental reviews. Now, the
Trump administration is trying to quietly reissue climate guidance
because, quite simply, the courts will not let them ignore climate
change.
12 court cases that affirm NEPA's climate review role
Since President Trump took office, NEPA has upheld the federal
requirement to consider climate--specifically greenhouse gas
emissions--at various levels in courts across the country at least 12
times. Below are brief summaries of each of those cases, starting with
the most recent decision through the oldest.
1 Oil and gas leases in New Mexico (Dine Citizens Against Ruining Our
Environmentv. David Bernhardt): In May 2019, the court held that NEPA
had been violated because climate impacts were not considered when the
U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) issued oil and gas leases around
New Mexico's Chaco Canyon in the San Juan Basin.
2 Federal coal moratorium (State of California v. U.S. Department of
the Interior): In April 2019, the court held that the Trump
administration's rescission of a DOI moratorium on all new federal coal
leases constituted a major federal action sufficient to trigger NEPA
analysis.
3 Leases in Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado (Wildearth Guardians v. Ryan
Zinke): In March 2019, the court held that oil and gas leases in
Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado included an inadequate NEPA analysis
because ``NEPA required more robust analyses of GHG [greenhouse gasJ
emissions from oil and gas drilling and downstream use.''
4 Master Development Plan in Colorado (Citizens for a Health Community
v. U.S. Bureau of Land Management): In March 2019, the court held that
the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) violated NEPA when it attempted to
rely on production estimates when permitting an oil and gas project in
Colorado but refused to rely on the projected greenhouse gas emissions
from those same estimates.
5 Pipeline in Virginia (National Parks Conservation Association v. Todd
T. Semonite): In March 2019, the court held that the U.S. Army Corps
violated NEPA when it granted a permit allowing a utility company to
build a series of electrical transmission towers across the James River
without taking a hard look at the transmission project's environmental
impacts.
6 Mining expansion for Montana's Spring Creek Mine (Wildearth Guardians
v. Ryan Zinke): In February 2019, the court held that the Office of
Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement's (OSM) decision not to
prepare an environmental impact statement under NEPA was arbitrary and
capricious because the OSM didn't fully analyze certain environmental
impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions.
7 Appalachian Trail pipeline across the Southeast (Cowpasture River
Preservation Association v. U.S. Forest Service): In December 2018, the
court held that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service
violated NEPA by failing to consider the effects--including those
related to climate--of authorizing a 600-mile natural gas pipeline that
crossed two national forests and part of the Appalachian Trail.
8 Keystone XL pipeline across the Great Plains (Indigenous
Environmental Network v. U.S. Department of State): In November 2018,
the court held that the U.S. Department of State failed to complete an
adequate environmental review under NEPA when it disregarded prior
factual findings related to the Keystone XL pipeline and climate
change.
9 Colorado River Valley Resource Management Plan in Colorado
(Wilderness Workshop v. U.S. Bureau of Land Management): In October
2018, the court held that the BLM violated NEPA when it attempted to
apply an environmental impact statement that did not consider the
impacts of greenhouse gas pollution to a resource management plan.
10 Coal leases in Montana (Western Organization of Resource Councils v.
U.S. Bureau of Land Management): In March 2018, the court held that the
BLM failed to consider reasonable alternatives for coal leasing by
failing to calculate greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the coal
leases, as required under NEPA.
11 Southeast Market Pipelines Project across the Southeast (Sierra Club
v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission): In March 2018, the court held
that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's environmental impact
statement for the Southeast Market Pipelines Project failed to
adequately take into account greenhouse gas emissions that would result
from burning the natural gas carried by the pipeline.
12 Mining modification in Montana's Bull Mountains (Montana
Environmental Information Center v. U.S. Office of Surface Mining): In
November 2017, the court held that the OSM failed to adequately
consider the need for an environmental impact statement and to take a
hard look at the indirect, cumulative, and foreseeable effects of a
proposed coal mine expansion in central Montana. The court went so far
as to suggest the use of the social cost of carbon protocol tool from
the Obama administration's 2016 NEPA climate guidance.
Conclusion
The courts have made it eminently clear that the Trump administration
must consider greenhouse gas emissions when conducting the
environmental review of a federal project under NEPA. Recently, the DOI
responded to one of these court-mandated environmental reviews by
releasing a haphazard, insufficient analysis with a deeply truncated
public comment period of just 15 days. Given recent national and
international reports on the dire nature of the climate crisis, the CEQ
should now issue robust guidance consistent with the 2016 version, lest
Trump administration agencies continue to ignore or rush court-mandated
environmental reviews. This would require, for example, codifying that
iteration's social cost of carbon tool, to be used in calculating the
climate effects of a given project.
Whether by intention or not, NEPA has become the strongest climate
policy in the Trump era. Congress should protect it--even if and when
they develop more targeted climate legislation--and in the meantime;
the CEQ must issue its climate guidance for federal agencies as soon as
possible.

The Chairman. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from
Arizona, the Chair of the Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations, Mr. Gosar.
Dr. Gosar. Thank you, Ms. Mallory, for being here today. I
have a couple of real quick questions, and then I will have a
follow-up.
Can you push the advancement of scientific discovery? Can
you actually force us to become a discovery? Yes or no.
Ms. Mallory. Sorry, my mic is off. No.
Dr. Gosar. Thank you, I appreciate that. Could you also
provide us an idea of what mine you would support in the United
States?
Ms. Mallory. Thank you, Congressman. We have supported a
number of mines over the last few years.
Dr. Gosar. Give me just one name.
Ms. Mallory. There is a vanadium mine, I believe it is in
Nevada. We supported a cobalt mine, I am not real sure what
state it was in. We have supported a lithium mine going
forward. There are a number of mines that are in progress.
Dr. Gosar. Just wanted to make sure. OK. Now, I am going to
change gears here a little bit.
On November 30, 2022, the Council on Environmental Quality
and the Office of Science and Technology issued guidance for
Federal departments and agencies on Indigenous knowledge. I
represent several well-known, large tribes, so I would like to
get a bit of clarity on this issue. Tribes have spent a lot of
time ensuring that they have the right to consultation. Making
a choice to include or not to include Indigenous knowledge in a
Federal decision-making process, that is not a substitute for
consultation or any other scientific process, for that matter.
Question: What specific area of tribal knowledge are
agencies being encouraged to look for and review?
How will this knowledge be utilized?
Ms. Mallory. Thank you, Congressman, for that question. I
mean, that was an effort that we undertook because we were
hearing from lots of tribes through the consultation process
that we had done that their knowledge, their understanding of
their areas wasn't being recognized appropriately. So, we were
trying to create a mechanism to ensure that, as agencies go
through their processes, that they create a space for tribes to
contribute Indigenous knowledge if they have something they
want to share. It is their knowledge.
And there are times that they don't want to share, so we
had to recognize that----
Dr. Gosar. I think, the key there is if they want to share,
right?
Ms. Mallory. Correct.
Dr. Gosar. OK. Now, on page 5 of the guidance in Section 3
titled, ``Illustrative List of Federal Statutes Where
Indigenous Knowledge May be Relevant,'' several of the statutes
included NEPA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and the
National Historic Preservation Act. These and several other
statutes already require that agencies seek tribal input.
By providing this additional opportunity for tribal input
on top of what is already required for the consultation, will
tribal organizations now be afforded more weight in a Federal
decision-making than potential stakeholders such as state and
local governments?
Ms. Mallory. No, that was not the intention. The intention
was to just make sure that this particular kind of knowledge,
which I think tribes were telling us was not getting
recognized, is included.
Dr. Gosar. We were making sure that that won't be a higher
standard for them. It will be very similar to state and local
governments, right?
Ms. Mallory. And other information.
Dr. Gosar. OK, thank you. Prior to this guidance, have
there been instances where agencies were deliberately ignoring
Tribal Nations and tribal members when they were affected
communities, that the consultation process would not be
resolved?
To say this perhaps a little clearer, what problem are we
looking to solve here?
Ms. Mallory. Yes, as I said, we went through a consultation
process and were hearing from the tribes that they felt like
there were situations in which their knowledge was not being
recognized, or they weren't given the opportunity to actually
participate. So, we were trying to address that.
Dr. Gosar. OK. When we talk about the input of affected
communities, how does that work in the NEPA process when
reconciling disagreements between communities and the findings
of agencies conducting the report?
How do you resolve those?
Ms. Mallory. Yes, I mean, I think in the end, obviously,
the decision maker has to weigh all of the information that
they are getting from a variety of sources and the goals that
they are trying to meet. So, all of that is part of the
decision process.
Dr. Gosar. Does this guidance change the way that agencies
will review different perspectives and how they determine their
findings?
Ms. Mallory. No.
Dr. Gosar. OK. In Appendix C of the guidance, agencies are
advised on potential ways to verify information obtained from
tribes using an example from the U.S. Global Change Research
Program. Can you walk the Committee through the suggested
process for verifying this information?
Ms. Mallory. Actually, I just don't remember that
particular appendix. But the idea behind the effort was to make
sure that, if there were questions about the validity of
information, that the agencies and their agency science staff
were evaluating that.
Dr. Gosar. Is there any other type of guidance similar to
this one that CEQ is planning to be issuing this year?
Ms. Mallory. We haven't talked about any further guidance,
no.
Dr. Gosar. OK. And if you could refine that previous
question a little bit more, we would love to have that. Thank
you.
I yield back.
Ms. Mallory. The gentleman yields back. The Chair
recognizes Ms. Velazquez for 5 minutes.
Ms. Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Chairwoman Mallory, for your testimony before
the Committee today.
Every person, regardless of their zip code, deserves to
live, work, and go to school in an environmentally thriving and
unpolluted community. And as you know, the Council on CEQ
places a key role in ensuring this through the Justice40
Initiative. As the Representative of New York's 7th
Congressional District, which includes many historically
underserved environmental justice neighborhoods like
Ravenswood, Queensbridge, and Cypress Hill, I know how
important the Justice40 Initiative is for local communities.
Can you please briefly highlight any of the benefits
environmental justice communities are seeing from the
implementation of the Justice40 Initiative?
Ms. Mallory. Thank you so much, Congresswoman, for that
question.
Yes, I think that, obviously, the anchor focus of all of
our work in environmental justice, as in other areas, is
ensuring that all communities have the opportunity to have
access to clean air, clean water, and a healthy environment.
Some of the, I think, cleanest examples of how this is helping
is electric school buses. Well, among the programs under
Justice40 that is actually having a benefit right now are the
electric school buses that are going all across the country.
The cleaning up of Superfund sites, that is an absolute
example of where it is not only making a difference in getting
rid of the pollution, it is also allowing opportunities to open
up areas that had been blighted to further development.
The Department of Agriculture has a program that is called
the Urban Forestry, and it is an example where communities are
able to plant trees, maintain trees, and all of this is really
important not only for the beauty of trees, but also for
helping to reduce air pollution, for helping to reduce
flooding, and dealing with heat.
Those are just three examples of things where it is at work
now, and the Urban Heat was an example of a program that was
entirely Justice40 programs.
Ms. Velazquez. Thank you for that. Chair Mallory, can you
explain why CEQ has the authority to include environmental
justice in the Phase 2 NEPA regulations?
Ms. Mallory. Yes, absolutely. When you look at CEQ's
statute, and in particular the portions that talk about what
are we trying to achieve, what are the goals of the National
Environmental Policy Act, it really talks about ensuring that
all communities actually have a healthy environment, healthy
benefit, that the idea is to make sure that the Federal
Government is doing its part to ensure that it is considering
how the environmental impacts are going to affect communities
and affect all people. So, that is very much a part of our
authority.
Ms. Velazquez. Thank you. And how is CEQ supporting the
objectives in the framework, especially those to help
communities proactively integrate nature-based solutions into
their infrastructure, which is particularly important in denser
cities like New York?
Ms. Mallory. Yes, absolutely. The nature-based solutions,
part of our America the Beautiful initiative, very much
recognizes that for some communities there is, like, a dearth
of green space. And that is very important for heat reduction.
We know that. We know that there can be as much as a 17 degree
difference in communities, depending on the number of trees.
So, we have been working across the Administration to ensure
that our programs are incorporating that opportunity into the
funding.
Ms. Velazquez. Thank you. And can you also comment briefly
on why it is important to have such an ambitious, overarching
framework to guide how we modernize our Federal programs and
policies to strengthen climate resiliency?
Ms. Mallory. Yes, absolutely. We know that the lower-income
communities, often rural communities, tribal communities, these
are communities that are kind of hit first and hardest by the
climate change impacts. So, any solution to addressing climate
change really has to also address the folks who are most
vulnerable. And that is the essence of our program.
Ms. Velazquez. Thank you very much.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
The Chairman. The gentlelady yields back. The Chair
recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Graves.
Mr. Graves. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chair Mallory, thank you for being here again. Could you
give a quick update on where you are with the e-NEPA?
Congresswoman Hoyle and I included language in the
legislation last year that was enacted.
Ms. Mallory. Yes, absolutely. We have been working over the
course of the past year through a variety of different
mechanisms to create the report that I think Congress asked
for, identifying opportunities for technology uses in the NEPA
process. I believe our deadline is coming up, something like
June 2, and we are working towards that deadline.
Mr. Graves. Yes, I believe it is that first week in June.
And you think you are going to be on track for that?
Ms. Mallory. I think we are.
Mr. Graves. OK, great. Thank you.
The next question, there has been a lot of discussion about
the Fiscal Responsibility Act and the changes in NEPA. Did you
participate in those negotiations?
Ms. Mallory. I did not directly.
Mr. Graves. OK, thanks. When I go through the Phase 2 regs
I can't help but see how it appears that CEQ has taken what was
an information decision tool and actually changed it into a
decision tool. So, instead of informing decisions among other
issues that would inform decisions, other criteria and data-
informed decisions, it appears that there has been sort of this
conversion there to where it is actually trying to make
decisions.
So, just one question: What does the word ``important''
mean to you?
Ms. Mallory. Important?
Mr. Graves. Important, yes.
Ms. Mallory. Important. I don't want to use
``significant,'' I know we were trying to avoid that in the
rule. Important is of a higher standard.
Mr. Graves. OK, a higher standard. And I want to make sure
I heard what you just said. You just said that you all were
trying to avoid using the word ``significant.''
Ms. Mallory. Well, I think we wanted to make sure that we
were leaving ``significant'' so that it appeared in the
regulation in the places where that assessment was being made
as to whether or not the project was significant.
Mr. Graves. Do you understand that the law actually says
``significant,'' and you changed it to ``important,'' which I
think is a distinguishing factor? So, the law actually says
``significant,'' so that was the standard. It is concerning to
me there was an intentional effort to avoid the use of the word
that was intentionally put in the law to establish a higher
standard. That is concerning, and I think it was a deviation,
in fact, not just a deviation from the four corners of the law,
but it was a deviation from the clear intent of Congress.
Now, speaking of the intent of Congress, would you say that
the NEPA law that was enacted last year is a giveaway to big
oil, and takes a major bite out of bedrock environmental laws?
Ms. Mallory. The Fiscal Responsibility last year did not do
that.
Mr. Graves. OK. Do you consider it a major blow to NEPA?
Ms. Mallory. The Fiscal Responsibility? I think we have
embraced the changes that the President agreed to.
Mr. Graves. OK, and you believe that there is some degree
of congressional intent that should be applied to your
interpretation, is that accurate?
Ms. Mallory. We definitely applied the----
Mr. Graves. Because those two terms that I just used, that
was actually a quote from Ranking Member Grijalva, who called
the law a major assault on NEPA. And then the other one was
from Mr. Huffman, who called it a giveaway to big oil and takes
``major bites out of bedrock environmental laws.''
But then Mr. Huffman just recently said in the hearing that
there is a disconnect between the hype of FRA and the reality
of the changes, because it actually has common-sense
sideboards, which I really think, what we are all getting to,
Chair Mallory, is that what CEQ has implemented is not what was
enacted. It was not what was agreed to in the negotiations.
Significant changes were made by CEQ, which is why now, on
a bipartisan basis, there is a Congressional Review Act
resolution that was going to be filed, let me say that again, a
bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Review Act resolution that
will be introduced to repeal your regulations because they are
not consistent with the law. And whether it is repealed from
the CRA or it is repealed from the courts, it is incredibly
frustrating that we spent all this time negotiating that, I am
going to say my friend, Mr. Huffman, and my friend, Mr.
Grijalva, actually agreed with us that we got it right and we
won, but then you, through the rulemaking process, just wrote
whatever it was that you wanted to write.
In NEPA, what does the N stand for?
Ms. Mallory. Congressman, I just have to disagree with
that. That is not correct.
Mr. Graves. OK, and I hear you, and we are going to let the
Congress and the courts decide that.
Ms. Mallory. Correct.
Mr. Graves. But the N in NEPA, what does that stand for?
Ms. Mallory. National.
Mr. Graves. National. So, why in the regulations do you put
global all over them, and looking at global effects? Is it the
International Environmental Policy Act or is it the National?
Ms. Mallory. It is the National Environmental Policy Act.
Mr. Graves. Yes, so I am struggling with why there are all
these global considerations, unless it is the issue that this
White House has forced, for every 1 ton of reduction we have
done in emissions in the United States, China has gone up by 5,
and that is going to continue happening under this regulation
because it doesn't properly comply with the law that was put in
place. Very frustrating.
I have a number of other questions I will be doing for the
record, Mr. Chairman.
I yield back.
The Chairman. The gentleman yields back. The Chair
recognizes the gentleman from Hawaii, Mr. Case, for 5 minutes.
Mr. Case. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Good to see you.
Ms. Mallory. Good to see you.
Mr. Case. Thank you so much for a lot of really great work,
I think, contrary to some of the questions here, incredible
work. I certainly appreciate your work on the America the
Beautiful challenge. I would be happy to give you time to talk
about that a little bit more.
But the area that I think just gets neglected all the time
is our oceans, because we spend a lot of time talking about
protecting our lands and our air. And I value all of that, but
sometimes in the debate our oceans are left behind. And you
have done some really incredible work in this Administration on
the Ocean Climate Action Plan, oceans, justice strategy, ocean
acidification, coral reefs, protection of some of the most
valuable resources in our entire world, moving towards some
kind of a greater protected status.
I, of course, am personally interested in the Pacific
remote islands and getting a status report on that, but I
wondered if you might just take the time to lay out what you
have been doing on the oceans, and where things stand, what
your challenges are, and where we can help you.
Ms. Mallory. Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Congressman, for
that question.
As you noted, the America the Beautiful initiative actually
envisioned the work that we are doing kind of across land and
water, and Congress actually directed CEQ, along with the
Office of Science Technology Policy, to create and stand up our
Ocean Policy Committee. And through that Committee, we have
been doing inter-agency work on all the issues you identified.
The Ocean Climate Action Plan, the first of its kind for
this country, was a really important step, and it was a
recognition that our ocean has a really important role in our
climate activities, both in terms of recognizing the harm that
is caused there that we need to address, but also in taking
advantage of the opportunities that are there. So, the work
under that in which we identified for every agency work that
they can be doing and should be doing in terms of thinking
about how they are addressing the ocean, was laid out. And we
just issued in the last couple of months kind of the update on
where that work is, and I think that is a good place to look to
see the work that has occurred over the last year since we put
out the Ocean Climate Action Plan.
The Ocean Justice Strategy was part of that. That was
called for and, again, a recognition that we often lose sight
of some of the communities that are affected most and most
directly, particularly on the coast, and that we wanted to just
make sure that they are also part of the solution as we are
thinking about how we are going to rebuild our coastal areas or
shore up our coastal areas. So, that work is really going on.
As you mentioned, the Pacific Remote Island is an area, as
well as Chumash Heritage Areas are two sanctuary areas that the
Administration has proposals out on. Both of them have unique
features that we think are important for kind of ocean
protection and ocean coastal work. Those are going through the
sanctuary process and are underway.
But I think we are continuing with respect to the ocean to
think in terms of making sure, for example, on the climate
side, the offshore wind has really blossomed in this
Administration. We have gone from having no permitted
facilities to having eight permitted facilities in the last
3\1/2\ years because of a recognition of how that can be really
important to our climate goals.
Mr. Case. What are your next steps?
We are back to challenges. Where do you need help from
Congress on advancing these goals for our ocean?
Ms. Mallory. Yes, I think help from Congress, I think,
probably comes up in individual circumstances where, for
example, I know that Dr. Spinrad is going to be here later
today, probably best able to identify where his agency would
benefit from additional funding or resources. I think that
would be a good place to answer that question.
But as always, just the support in recognizing that this is
really important work that really needs Congress' support, as
well.
Mr. Case. How are we being received around the world?
Because this is, obviously, not just a United States effort. It
has to be with the rest of the world. And we have been
participating with the rest of the world. How is it going
there?
Ms. Mallory. Absolutely. And I think the United States
presence and its leadership has always been important, and
continues to be important in the ocean area, as well.
Mr. Case. OK. Thank you very much.
The Chairman. The gentleman yields back. The Chair
recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. LaMalfa, for 5
minutes.
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thanks for appearing with us, Chair, Mallory. A couple of
issues on the spending by your organization.
In 2019, the budget was just under $3 million per year, and
your request is to go to about $4.5 million for 2025. That is
about a 62 percent increase. But, also, you mentioned earlier
that the Inflation Reduction Act supplied you with about $62
million. Was that a correct number?
Ms. Mallory. Correct, $62.5 million.
Mr. LaMalfa. OK. And I also heard Mr. Bentz asking you
about the number of personnel there. There are several dozen he
had mentioned. How are you paying for that with a budget that
had been between $2.89 million in 2019 and a figure somewhere
south of the request for $4.67 million? How are you paying for
those personnel?
Ms. Mallory. The personnel that we have, Congressman, as I
said, the $62.5 million also includes resources for staffing.
So, some of the employees that we have are termed to the Fiscal
Year 2026 expiration.
Mr. LaMalfa. So, that Inflation Reduction Act is one-time
money, so that means you are going to have to cut loose a lot
of employees in a year or two.
Ms. Mallory. We have been hiring them on terms to be
consistent with the Fiscal Year 2026 expiration.
Mr. LaMalfa. OK. So, that will be temporary.
In 2022, the agency rolled back NEPA reforms that had been
made under the Trump administration which were going to
decrease the burden of environmental reviews and the
frustration with NEPA. On top of that, Congress passed the
Fiscal Responsibility Act we have heard referenced many times
today, putting in place a streamlined process for many of the
NEPA aspects. Last month, those rules were finalized, and what
we see is that your agency only applied those Fiscal
Responsibility Act changes to wind and solar projects. Is that
how you have interpreted that?
Ms. Mallory. No, that is not correct. The National
Environmental Policy Act regulations apply to all Federal
projects.
Mr. LaMalfa. But the reforms you have only applied to wind
and solar projects.
Ms. Mallory. That is not correct.
Mr. LaMalfa. OK, then we will straighten that out. So,
anybody applying for other NEPA will be able to enjoy the same
streamlining process that was put in place, not just wind and
solar.
Ms. Mallory. Correct.
Mr. LaMalfa. OK, glad to hear it. Do you believe that what
Congress passed in 1970 and Richard Nixon signed and many
Republicans voted for in 1970 on NEPA is in line today with
what was intended back then?
Ms. Mallory. I do, Congressman. Yes, I do.
Mr. LaMalfa. You do.
Ms. Mallory. I believe it is in line.
Mr. LaMalfa. OK. Well, we hear some wild things thrown
around in this room here, this hearing and many others, about
Republicans being big polluters and pro all that when there is
a track record of having supported basic good environmental
policy. But many of us feel like it has been weaponized now.
So, you see where the incredible delays and incredible costs
and deterrence to doing projects is right in line with 1970?
Ms. Mallory. No. I am sorry, I guess I misunderstand your
question. I think we have been working as an Administration to
address the concerns about timelines and to advance the
environmental policy in ways that allow you to do environmental
policy and include the public and make sure that we are getting
good decisions. I think those are the anchors that we have been
using, and those flow directly from the statute.
Mr. LaMalfa. Well, a heap of comments that come from the
public at the behest of e-mails sent out by environmental
organizations isn't necessarily great policy, it is just more
stoppage. Let me put this on something that is a little more
tangible.
In California, our water situation can be very dire year
in, year out. We have been blessed in the last years, we have
had an incredible amount of rain and snowpack, which have
filled most of our lakes. But in that process sometimes, and in
a little lesser water year, we will see that the lakes don't
fill, and they don't have the ability, when a lake is reaching
that point of, conservation level we will call it, that the law
requires them to dump water because they don't have updated
manuals. These manuals go way back 50-plus years ago of how
they have to operate the lakes for flood control. So, we have
been waiting for years to get these manuals in place. And the
manuals take over 3 years, at least, and there are 29 lakes
that are waiting for this process to be done.
And we find that, in practice, when one has been done, 10
percent of additional water was saved. So, if you take over 15
million acre-feet of capacity, 1.5 million acre-feet would mean
a lot to people in California that are seeing their water cut
in agriculture by 60 percent, and people told in urban areas
they have to use only 42 gallons per day. So, what can we do to
streamline the revamping of the manuals that they operate their
flood control on? Because the NEPA process and CEQ are
requiring 3 years to get these done.
Ms. Mallory. Yes, Congressman. As I was saying, the whole
point of our streamlining efforts is to try to ensure that the
needed projects actually can occur as expeditiously as
possible.
I am not familiar with the particular manuals you are
talking about, but the work that we are doing to try to make
sure that we are focused on the issues that are most important
for decision, I think, will help that effort, as well as
others.
Mr. LaMalfa. Well, NEPA requires every single lake----
The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired.
Mr. LaMalfa. We need the refinement of that on every single
lake, a template.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I will yield back.
The Chairman. All right, the Chair recognizes the
gentlelady from New Mexico, Ms. Leger Fernandez.
Ms. Leger Fernandez. Thank you, Chairman, and thank you,
Chairwoman Mallory, for joining us today. Thank you so much for
the work that you do to protect our communities and
environment. It is so essential. It is incredibly essential in
my district.
I represent a very rural district. And as you know, Federal
investments are key in our rural areas. I am very pleased at
the fact that during President Biden and the 117th Congress led
by Democrats, we had the largest investment in rural America.
You are shaking your head yes, because it was so exciting,
right? The largest investment in rural America, basically,
since the New Deal and electrification.
One of those programs was the World Energy for America
Program, or WEAP, which, as you know, provides grants and loans
for clean energy and energy efficiency projects on farms and
ranches.
We also had a revision of the USDA scoring criteria for
WEAP to prioritize projects in disadvantaged and distressed
communities as part of Justice40. Can you speak a bit about why
it is both possible and important to be aware of the Justice40
and making sure that we are placing projects in rural areas
next to disadvantaged, I don't like to use ``disadvantaged,''
but communities that have faced way too many hurdles and
suffered through too many injustices, and have a desire for
opportunity.
Ms. Mallory. Yes.
Ms. Leger Fernandez. How are we doing that, and how are you
reconciling those two issues?
Ms. Mallory. Thank you so much, Congresswoman, for that
question. And yes, I think our focus in the Justice40
Initiative and under our environmental justice program in
general, are the communities who have been underinvested in,
who have suffered from a lot of the burdens of pollution
burdens, but have also not had the benefit of the Federal
funding that has come through before. So, a very, very high
priority.
And we think it is important because, as we are trying to
kind of revitalize all parts of this country, we know that
places like in rural America, on tribal lands, in poorer
communities, in some of our urban areas we know these are the
places in which if we can add a spark of industry to those
areas, it will allow for communities to thrive. And that is
really the focus of all of the programs that the President has
been advancing.
Ms. Leger Fernandez. And I think when we add that spark, we
need to make sure it is not a spark that is also dirty, right,
or that burns things down. We were a little worried about
sparks in my district because of our forest fires.
Ms. Mallory. Oh, yes, sorry.
Ms. Leger Fernandez. And the ability of ranchers and
farmers to layer income streams, I think, is another really
important thing that I hope you all keep in mind as we think
about this.
I want to really talk about the issue also of PFAS
contamination. These forever chemicals have been found in the
groundwater outside of probably every single air force base. I
have one of those air force bases, the Cannon Air Force Base in
Clovis, New Mexico. In 2018, the PFAS was found. It is in the
drinking water. One dairy farmer was forced to euthanize 5,000
cows. That dairy farm itself is no longer a viable place
because he used the PFAS-tainted water to irrigate, and we
still don't have a remediation plan, and the Air Force is being
difficult. USDA needs to do better.
And while I appreciated the new standards coming out, we
also don't have a plan to how we are going to help our smaller
municipalities address the removal of PFAS. So, what is CEQ
doing to improve our understanding of PFAS and how best to
remove it from our communities, and then how to help them get
that done?
Ms. Mallory. Yes. Thank you so much for that. And,
actually, the PFAS issue is quite a significant and widespread
issue, as you described. And this President has devoted more
funding to the PFAS than has been done in the past. But we know
that we are going to need more dollars. There were like $9
billion that were focused on PFAS and other emerging chemicals
from the Inflation Reduction Act.
But the questions that you are asking about I think have to
do with the implementation. And I think that we are working
with the agencies kind of across the Administration to try to
make sure that each agency is taking the steps that it can in
the places that it has some authority. And USDA is very focused
on farmers and on some of the impacts that have been
experienced by the farming community.
When EPA issued its Safe Drinking Water Act regulation just
a few weeks ago, they also released $1 billion in funding to
try to help some of these smaller entities, actually
municipalities, to deal with the changes that are going to be
necessary, or the review that is necessary.
But more dollars are needed, and I think that we are
serving as technical assistance--we, being EPA, serving as
technical assistance, to try to help communities identify where
there is additional funding that is possible, and how they can
work together.
Ms. Leger Fernandez. Thank you very much, and keep putting
some pressure on the DOD, because they need to be a lot more
responsive.
With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
The Chairman. The gentlelady's time has expired. The Chair
recognizes the gentleman from Idaho, Mr. Fulcher, for 5
minutes.
Mr. Fulcher. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chair Mallory, thank you for being here today. Earlier in
this hearing, Chairman Bentz from Oregon mentioned a letter
that he had sent you in February 2024. And it is in regard to
the Columbia River system. And you had responded back to his
letter, and I will just read a quote from that.
In your response, you said, ``The U.S. Government made a
commitment to work with regional stakeholders to develop a
long-term, durable solution to restore salmon and other native
fish populations in the interior basin to healthy and abundant
levels. While honoring the Federal Government's commitment to
Tribal Nations, delivering affordable and reliable clean power,
and supporting local regional economies in meeting the many
resilience needs of stakeholders across the region through
mediation.'' That is a long sentence, but there is a lot said
in there.
And in regard to the lower Snake River dam situation, this
is a critical part of that region's electrical grid, with many
other uses, as well.
And I was reminded here by a note from the Bonneville Power
Administration that there was an Arctic blast last January. And
according to the Bonneville Power Administration, the Lower
Snake River Dams made a major, this is a quote, ``made a major
contribution to the efforts to keep the lights on for that
region.''
Now, while this is all going on, we have organizations like
the Pacific Northwest Utilities Conference Committee that
recently made a statement that the projected electricity demand
is going to increase more than 30 percent for the region over
the next decade.
I communicate all that to lay the basis for a question,
which is, of course there is the breaching issue, and this is
what a recommendation and result came from through CEQ. And I
just need to ask you, how would breaching or undermining the
operability of the Lower Snake River Dams limit the region's
ability to respond to things like this Arctic blast in the last
bit of January, or deal with the growing needs in the area?
Ms. Mallory. Thank you, Congressman, for that question. And
just to be clear, there has been no breaching recommendation
from CEQ or any other Federal agency----
Mr. Fulcher. I think we both know exactly where CEQ was
going in this whole----
Ms. Mallory. What we know is that Congress is the only
entity that can make the determination about breaching.
Mr. Fulcher. And what we know is your role, through CEQ
for, in essence, promoting that. So, I would still like an
answer to the question, which is how would the breaching--OK,
let's just take that. That is where the recommendation wound
up. But if those were breached, how do we backfill some of that
power source?
Ms. Mallory. Yes. As I said, there was no breaching
recommendation.
I think what we are doing right now----
Mr. Fulcher. We know where you are, yes, and we can
disagree on semantics.
Ms. Mallory. We can disagree.
Mr. Fulcher. But we know very, very well the role CEQ
played in promoting that.
Ms. Mallory. We are not promoting that.
Mr. Fulcher. Yes, you are.
Ms. Mallory. But let me just say this. What we had was a
historic settlement in December. And among the things that we
have authorized is an energy study that would actually provide
the information that is being done by one of DOE's labs to look
at the kind of energy mix and the energy portfolio in the
Pacific Northwest to see what opportunities would exist if that
was a decision that Congress made.
Mr. Fulcher. The hydropower source that comes from those
dams is extremely clean, extremely efficient, and extremely
needed for that region.
In August 2022, Senator Patty Murray and Governor Jay
Inslee released the Lower Snake River Dams Benefit Replacement
Report, and they stated in that report that replacing the
services provided by the dams could range from a cost of
somewhere between $10.3 billion and $31.3 billion. So, if that
were to be needed, where would those funds come from?
Ms. Mallory. That literally is part of the analysis that is
being done now, as a result of the settlement we were able to
achieve.
Mr. Fulcher. Well, the answer to that is it would have to
come through taxpayers. That is where this would ultimately
need to come from, and ratepayers.
Ms. Mallory. I don't think that is necessarily true, but
that is what the study is looking at.
Mr. Fulcher. Well, that is where this is going to go. And
at the same time, that source is going to be degraded, so I
wanted to point that out. And as a result of that, we are going
to have further impact on the regional economy, and that was
also addressed in your letter.
At the hearing in this Committee back in December, before
the final settlement agreement was announced, we heard from
several stakeholders who expressed frustration with how the
Administration pursued the settlement agreement. What do you
say to the stakeholders who feel that they were not given an
opportunity to be heard by CEQ?
Ms. Mallory. Yes, actually, we had certain parties who were
part of the litigation that was being settled that were part of
a mediation, but we took a number of steps to try to make sure
that the views of stakeholders who were not parties to the
litigation could be included, which included listening
sessions, it created a special kind of comment box where people
could provide their information, and all of that was provided
to the mediators and the mediation parties.
Mr. Fulcher. Well, we are out of time, but I just want to
close by saying that the Chairman referenced the initial
mission of CEQ, and that was overseeing NEPA compliance. We
have strayed far, far from that mission. Thank you, Chair
Mallory.
I yield back.
The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired. The Chair
recognizes the gentlelady from Oregon, Ms. Hoyle, for 5
minutes.
Ms. Hoyle. Thank you. I yield my time to Mr. Huffman.
Mr. Huffman. I thank the gentlelady from Oregon.
Chair Mallory, I want to get back to cleaning up a few
things that have been covered in some of the Republican
questioning. And my colleague from Louisiana spent a lot of
time with you on this issue of the word ``significant'' that he
claims was used in a very meaningful way in the Fiscal
Responsibility Act, and the word ``important'' that apparently
appears in some of your rulemaking under your NEPA 2.0 process.
He suggested that you have done a bait and switch, that you
have essentially deliberately ignored that word, and created a
whole new standard through the rulemaking.
We have been doing a little scavenger hunt here for the
last few minutes since that questioning to try to find some
place where the word ``significant'' was replaced by the word
``important'' as between the FRA and your rulemaking. We can't
find it. We really have no idea what the gentleman is talking
about. Do you have any idea what this accusation pertains to,
and can you shed a little light on it?
Ms. Mallory. Yes, thank you, Congressman, for that
question.
I mean, as he was asking it I could not think of where we
had intentionally replaced the word. That was out of the
statute. I think we tried to veer very close to the statute,
but I was not aware of a specific place where we made that
choice.
Mr. Huffman. All right. And then, with respect to the Lower
Snake River Dams, which you were just asked about quite a bit,
can you just remind us all of the things that would need to
happen between now and, of course, the study that is in
process, and any actual breaching of those Lower Snake River
Dams?
And by the way, it is my understanding that not only would
an Act of Congress be necessary, but there would have to be
replacement power for any power lost, which is something that
the gentleman neglected to mention. But please remind us.
Ms. Mallory. Yes, thank you so much for that. I think the
key is that we and the Federal Government have faced many
decades of litigation that have been around the operations of
the dams. And we tried in this Administration to kind of create
a space in which we would be able to focus on getting the
information that is necessary to be able to enable Congress to
even have a conversation about that. So, we have created,
through the settlement, a 10-year kind of reprieve in which we
are doing a number of studies that look at the energy needs,
that look at the agricultural needs, that look at the
recreational needs, all of the needs that the dams actually
replace so that people could talk about whether or not there is
a need or desire to go forward. And that is all underway.
Mr. Huffman. All right, thank you. Last bit of cleanup from
the questioning. Some of my own quotes after the Fiscal
Responsibility Act passed were mentioned. While I think that
these were largely paper cuts when it comes to the Republican
agenda of dismantling NEPA, I certainly resented the fact that
they were even on the table in the context of a debt default
crisis. The fact that they were used as ransom in taking the
global economy hostage was a disgrace. I was talking a lot
about that, and I was also talking about another really awful
provision in the Fiscal Responsibility Act that greenlighted
the Mountain Valley pipeline. We didn't ask you about that,
because that is not part of your NEPA 2.0. But I find that to
be probably the worst part of what came out of that
legislation.
Now, I want to change subjects and ask you about IUU
fishing. This is something I work on a lot. The terrible IUU
fishing practices that we know about on the high seas are bad
for our fishermen because they have to compete with bad actors
around the world, and it is terrible for the marine ecosystem.
And the more we understand about it, we know that there are
also terrible human rights and slave labor and other impacts
associated with this, and we do not even understand where a lot
of our seafood comes from.
I have been working on this for quite some time, and there
are so many different Federal agencies that have a piece of it,
and it is just infinitely frustrating to try to talk to them
and have them each point at the other. I know one of your
roles, Chair Mallory, is to sort of be air traffic control for
Federal agencies when it comes to these situations, get
everybody applying the same standards, working in a coherent
way.
Can you talk at all about the extent to which your agency
has been involved in, for example, implementing the President's
2022 memorandum that identifies this as a threat to American
competitiveness and national security, and also a problem for
our fishing industry and climate change?
We have had 2 years since then. I am not getting anywhere
with the other agencies. Can you give me some reason to believe
that we are on the right track on this issue?
Ms. Mallory. I am sure we are on the right track, but it is
an effort that is being run by the National Security Council,
and we are working with them. I mean, we are happy to get any
information on updates on where things specifically are, but my
team is very much a part of the effort that the National
Security Council is leading, along with the Office of Science
Technology Policy.
Mr. Huffman. All right. I will look forward to following up
with you separately on that.
Ms. Mallory. OK.
Mr. Huffman. And again, thanks for your testimony.
I yield back.
The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired. The Chair
recognizes the gentleman from Montana, Mr. Rosendale, for 5
minutes.
Mr. Rosendale. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. As this
hearing is supposed to be focused on the budget review for CEQ,
I would like to at least start off with some questions about
the actual budget and how the money is being spent.
But I think it is first really important to clarify for the
people that are listening out there in the general public that
the CEQ started at pre-COVID numbers at $2.89 million for their
annual budget. And while the request now is at nearly double
that, $4.67 million, they need to understand government creep.
They need to understand the expansion of government. So, that
is just a minuscule amount as compared to what the agency is
actually receiving or has already received.
According to my numbers, we are looking at another $163
million in either transfers and unexpired, unobligated funds
that is going to go to CEQ between now and the end of fiscal
2025, most of that as a direct result of the so-called
Inflation Reduction Act, which has been documented by economic
experts to have contributed dramatically to the historic
inflation under the Biden administration.
So, while you are requesting $4.67 million, that is not an
accurate description of what the agency is actually going to
have access to, and how they can expand. As a matter of fact,
when you look at it, $63 million has been provided. You are
going to have another $58 million provided in Fiscal Year 2024,
and another $42 million provided in Fiscal Year 2025. If you
add all that up, that is 35 years worth of what the budget
would be under the inflated number that the President is asking
for now. Under the pre-COVID number of $2.89 million a year,
that would run your agency for 56 years, 56 years. And people
wonder why we have inflation, and people wonder why government
is out of control.
That is an obscene amount of money to be sent to your
agency. No offense to you, Chair Mallory, but it is an obscene
amount of money that is being sent to your agency to basically
be utilized to attack business and industry across our nation,
which has been demonstrated by the questions that have been
asked here today.
You stated that the Administration has invested $1 billion
in permitting capacity, yet there has been a significant
slowdown in permitting and leasing under this Administration.
Could you provide clarity on exactly where this $1 billion has
been allocated?
Ms. Mallory. Thank you so much for that question. I would
say, to start off with, the President asked for the $4.6
million because of the work that he has directed us to do----
Mr. Rosendale. Please go to my question, Ms. Mallory. I
have these numbers. Again, it is a grotesque amount of money
that your agency is receiving, $163 million between what you
have already received and what you are going to receive over
the next 2 years on an agency that Congress thinks and looks on
paper and sees that the request of $4.6 million--let's go back
to the $2.89 million. It is an obscene amount.
Ms. Mallory. Yes.
Mr. Rosendale. Where has this $1 billion been allocated?
Ms. Mallory. The $1 billion actually did not come directly
to CEQ. The $1 billion went to the multiple agencies who have a
permitting role. That is the $1 billion that everyone has been
referring to. And that is to help each of the agencies----
Mr. Rosendale. It is referred to in your testimony, as
well, though.
Ms. Mallory. It is in my testimony, $1 billion that went to
agencies.
Mr. Rosendale. Yes.
Ms. Mallory. It didn't come to CEQ. It went to a number of
different agencies who have a role in permitting.
Mr. Rosendale. But the permitting has been slowed down. In
your testimony, you note that the bipartisan permitting reform
implementation rule will accelerate the review of all projects.
Yet, when you listen to the type of projects that will be
accelerated, I can't help but notice that the baseload energy
projects, which are critical, have been left out.
When the potential capacity of electric generation is cited
by you or by other documents or other people that come in here,
it is very misleading. When most of the power is unreliable or
intermittent at best, most wind farms are rated somewhere
between 35 and 40 percent of full capacity, OK, full capacity
at 35 to 40 percent of the time. And solar energy is even lower
than that.
So, what is necessary for us as a population to provide
backup when these intermittent or reliable sources are not
available?
Ms. Mallory. I am not even sure what you are asking me.
Mr. Rosendale. When the intermittent or unreliable sources
such as solar and wind are not available, because they are only
available 35 to 40 percent of the time at full capacity, what
is necessary to provide that energy?
Ms. Mallory. I guess what I would say, Congressman, is that
we don't accept your premise that these things are being
managed in a way where there is going to leave the American
public without energy. We are very focused on the transition.
Mr. Rosendale. Chair Mallory, I am asking you what is going
to provide that energy, because it is a fact that that energy
is only available 35 to 40 percent of the time.
The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired. You can
submit more questions for the record.
Mr. Rosendale. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I yield back.
The Chairman. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from
California, Mr. Duarte, for 5 minutes.
Mr. Duarte. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate it.
Thank you, Chair Mallory, for being here today. I
appreciate you being here. A couple of specific things I would
really like your help with in my district.
I live in the San Joaquin Valley and represent the San
Joaquin Valley of California, where water scarcity has really
devastated our local communities. And we can talk about social
environmental justice in that sense from a different
perspective.
We have the Fish and Wildlife Service that regulates the
Endangered Species Act for the most part, and is concerned with
irrigated landscapes, habitat, estuaries, and restoration
across many terrestrial species that regulates most of what we
do. But when it comes to salmon and anadromous fish, which are
salmon, trout, things that go from rivers to oceans and back
again, or might go from rivers and oceans to back again, it is
regulated through the Department of Commerce under NMFS, the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
We are allowing gargantuan amounts of our precious water
resources to go out to the ocean in attempts to use river flow
as a single tool to re-establish the anadromous fish
populations. It is not working. It is not working at all, and
it is having very serious environmental and economic effects up
and down my district in many parts of the West. We have
irrigated landscapes and farming being depleted. We have our
energy resources being lost. We have the inability to sustain
some of our natural restoration ecosystems, grasslands,
marshes, and wetlands.
I would really ask, have you engaged this? Have you looked
at this disconnect? Because one of our pieces of legislation of
this Committee this year simply says, it is the Ken Calvert's
FISH Act, which just takes the authority for the restoration of
an anadromous fish, and puts it with Fish and Wildlife, where
efforts to re-establish these species can be balanced with
other needs more clearly.
Ms. Mallory. Thank you, Congresswoman. I have not studied
the kind of overview that you just described. I know that the
salmon is a particularly complex species in terms of the issues
that it intersects with, and I also know that the
Administration is very focused on trying to make sure that we
are looking at how climate change is impacting all of these
issues in ways that will allow us to meet our water needs in
the West.
Mr. Duarte. I appreciate that. And as you look at climate
change and salmon, the salmon populations that flow out through
the Delta and the San Francisco Bay are the southernmost
substantial salmon populations on the West Coast.
Ms. Mallory. Yes.
Mr. Duarte. And if we are going to accept that climate
change is a fact, re-establishing these to historical levels
under different climate regimes may simply be unrealistic and
have inordinate impacts on other ecosystems and other water
needs that we have in the West. And we have scarcity. That is a
given. So, thank you for that.
I would also ask, green energy is an issue here, and you
are here to help kind of quarterback and balance a lot of
concerns. If you look at the frontiers of our economic
development, of course, you have heard a lot of it today. I
watched it on the screen as much as in person. You have heard a
lot about how rural communities are being affected, and rural
jobs are being affected by resource decisions throughout the
country. A lot of it comes back to your office, and I would
really ask you to look seriously at it.
I think Mrs. Peltola did an excellent job walking through
the disengagement between her constituents and the rules
surrounding the North Slope oil drilling permits that should be
issued.
But I would also ask you to look at the energy needs of
America not as static. We have been draining the Strategic Oil
Reserve through this Administration. We haven't replenished it.
So, we are not meeting our needs as is. We have AI, which is
going to require huge server farms. We have Bitcoin mining,
which I disagree with on some levels. But if we are going to be
relevant in that area, we are going to need huge server farms.
Everything that we are looking at in the future for
repatriating microprocessors is going to take huge amounts of
electrons to meet the energy needs.
Our rural constituents are already seeing in my district
$0.35 to $0.50 kilowatt hours to air condition their homes
after working or, in many cases when there is drought, not
working on the farms. We are a long way from meeting our
current and future energy needs, and green energy simply will
not do it.
I beg you to look at, among the things you are
quarterbacking, get nuclear energy on-line in a realistic way
as soon as possible. We are going to devastate our economy, our
rural people, and our geopolitical relevance if we do not have
a serious, all-approaches energy policy, and we are not even
close. Windmills and solar will not do it.
So, I thank you for being here today, and I sincerely ask
your help on these issues.
Ms. Mallory. Thank you.
The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired. The Chair
recognizes the gentlelady from California, Ms. Porter, for 5
minutes.
Ms. Porter. Chair Mallory, one of the many permitting
reform bills we have voted on actually became law, and it
directly affects your agency. Chair Mallory, do you know what
bill that is?
Ms. Mallory. The Fiscal Responsibility Act.
Ms. Porter. Correct, the Fiscal Responsibility Act. That
bill raised the debt ceiling. What did it do exactly under your
purview?
Ms. Mallory. Thank you so much. The bill included a number
of permitting efficiencies. It basically directed us to have
specific deadlines. It directed us page limits on the
environmental impact statements and environmental assessments.
It required us to have a lead agency for the environmental
review process who is coordinating with various other
cooperating agencies, and provided some definitions there. It
included categorical exclusions and a sharing of categorical
exclusions across agencies, among other things.
Ms. Porter. When I listen to you, what I hear you
describing is a permitting reform passed by this Congress, by
this Republican-led Congress, focused on efficiency, clarity,
being able to deliver a more clear, efficient process so that
we can move major environmental projects through the National
Environmental Policy Act, NEPA, in a clear and successful way.
So, the rule fully implements the Fiscal Responsibility Act.
Ms. Mallory. Yes.
Ms. Porter. So, it is so weird to me that so many of my
Republican colleagues have accused CEQ of not implementing NEPA
reforms as passed in the Fiscal Responsibility Act. So, I want
to try to understand.
Is it accurate that the final rule, the Phase 2 rule,
reflects the changes made to NEPA?
Ms. Mallory. 100 percent.
Ms. Porter. So, for instance, as you mentioned, the rule
makes agencies condense environmental assessments into a single
document.
Ms. Mallory. Correct.
Ms. Porter. So, what exactly is the problem here on the
other side of the aisle?
You are fully complying with the Fiscal Responsibility Act,
a bill passed by this Republican-led House, and yet my
colleagues, the Republican colleagues in this very Committee,
are accusing you of breaking the law. Chair Mallory, I read the
rule, and it sounds like my colleagues are, to be generous,
dead wrong. But I wonder why they are really upset in the first
place. They are big mad. You are following the law. What could
they be big mad about? What does the CEQ do?
Ms. Mallory. We manage the Environmental Policy Act, and we
advise the President and his senior advisers on environmental
policy.
Ms. Porter. So, you implemented a bunch of items that
reflect the climate realities that we face, requiring projects,
for example, to disclose greenhouse gas emissions.
Ms. Mallory. Correct.
Ms. Porter. You can't know their motives, but is it
possible that is what they are mad about, that you are doing
your job to safeguard our environment?
I think that is exactly what it is. Because if they wanted
to, if Republicans wanted to, they could have limited CEQ's
role in protecting the environment. They could have done that
in the Fiscal Responsibility Act. They could have put in place
a different set of rules for permitting reform and for NEPA in
the Fiscal Responsibility Act. But they didn't. They put in
exactly what they did. You did exactly what the law directed
you to, and then they are big mad. And now they are lying to
the American people by making false allegations about you and
how you lead your agency.
I would have hoped, if there were an issue about actual
compliance with the law, we could have had a meaningful
discussion rooted in facts. But in this Committee we don't
because, frankly, my Republican colleagues are trying to blame
you rather than themselves, and I guess it is just easier for
them that way.
I yield back.
The Chairman. The gentlelady yields back. The Chair
recognizes the gentleman from Guam, Mr. Moylan, for 5 minutes.
Mr. Moylan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for
allowing me the opportunity to speak today about the harmful
impacts this Administration's policies have on my district.
Mr. Chairman, in yesterday's Subcommittee on Federal Lands'
Fiscal Year 2025 oversight hearing we heard the Administration
officials detail their commitment to collecting local and
Indigenous input on protecting this nation's natural beauty.
This is misleading at best, and at worst it is an outright lie
because the Pacific Remote Island Marine National Monuments and
the proposed sanctuaries restrict fishing activities in these
areas, unfairly impacting the development of industries in the
Pacific territories, while stripping away the ability of
Indigenous peoples to take care of the environments we have
known for millennia.
The Chamorro people of the Marianas have inhabited the
islands for over 4,000 years. This Administration has continued
policies of Federal overreach, impeding the ability of locals
to take care of their own environments.
Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to enter four
documents into the record. First, comments from the Guam
Fishery Co-op regarding proposal PRI Sanctuary dated June 2,
2023.
The second, the article titled, ``Marine Sanctuary
Expansion Alarms Pacific Governors,'' published in the Marianas
Variety on May 2, 2023.
Third, the letter by the Hawaiian Long Line Association
regarding proposed PRI Sanctuary dated June 1, 2023.
And finally, the article titled, ``Disavowing the Doctrine
of Discovery,'' written by Angelo Villagomez.
The Chairman. Without objection, so ordered.

Re: PRI-Proposed Sanctuary
Hafa adai,
I am writing to express deep reservations regarding designation of
the Pacific Remote Islands National Marine Sanctuary.
A sanctuary is supposed to be manageable. But this proposed
sanctuary is unprecedented in size. It is more than 50 times larger
than any previously-designated sanctuary. A sanctuary is also supposed
to comprise a discrete area. There is nothing discrete about what would
be created here. The sanctuary would include five separate designated
areas, with the sanctuary extending all the way to the EEZ for each
area.
Sanctuaries should be based on ecosystem and ecosystem function,
not on legal boundaries like the current proposal. The Western Pacific
Fishery Management Council conserves and manages fisheries using an
ecosystem-based approach and NOAA should be allowing the Fishery
Management Council to take the lead in recommending conservation and
management measures.
This sanctuary process should be driven by science, not politics.
Scientists have criticized the use of MPAs to protect biodiversity
because of the highly mobile nature of ocean biodiversity in the
region. If anyone will benefit from the sanctuary, it will be foreign
fishermen fishing just outside the sanctuary boundaries.
Any sanctuary should not ban fishing. Such a ban is not required in
a marine sanctuary and, in fact, most sanctuaries do not completely ban
fishing. Based on our experience with the Marianas Trench Marine
National Monument, it is likely that the refuge that is supposedly
created will be no refuge at all, because NOAA will not prohibit
Defense Department activities in a marine reserve.
Finally, at the public hearing, I asked for an extension of the
time to submit comments. As I write this, most of the people in Guam
are without water or power, let alone reliable internet service. Not
providing an extension under these circumstances exposes the failure of
NOAA/ONMS to provide a meaningful way for our community--which is made
up primarily of Indigenous people and ethnic minorities--to participate
in this process.
Thank you very much for the opportunity to submit these comments.
Manny Duenas,
President

Marine sanctuary expansion alarms Pacific governors

The prospect of expanding a marine sanctuary has alarmed CNMI Gov.
Arnold I. Palacios, Guam Gov. Lourdes Leon Guerrero and American Samoa
Gov. Lemanu Peleti Mauga.
In their joint letter to President Joseph Biden, the three governors
requested a meeting ``at your earliest convenience.''
``We are alarmed and concerned over the prospect of expanding potential
fishery closures through designating a marine sanctuary within the full
U.S. economic exclusive zones of the Pacific Remote Island Areas which
already include a Marine National Monument,'' Palacios, Leon Guerrero
and Mauga told the president in a letter.
They said further closures of waters around the U.S. Pacific islands
would be devastating to the local tuna economy of American Samoa and
deprive the Pacific territories of economic development opportunities
into the future.
The governors said fisheries are the leading source of economic
development that binds them to neighboring Pacific islands.
They said further closures would be in direct conflict with the Biden
administration's Indo-Pacific Economic Framework and run counter to the
principles of equity and environmental justice as outlined in Executive
Orders 13984 and 14008.
``Our already disadvantaged and marginalized communities carry a
disproportionate burden for meeting national conservation goals. We do
not believe taking further action to fully close waters around the
Pacific Remote Island Areas  necessary to fulfill the aspirations
of your `America the Beautiful' initiative,'' the governors said.
They requested further consultation on the matter before any decision
is made, ``because our communities and constituents inhabit islands in
proximity to the Pacific Remote Island Areas. Please have your staff
reach out to us and arrange a meeting, either in person or virtual.''

Dear Ms. LeBoeuf:
On behalf of the Hawaii Longline Association (HLA), thank you for
the opportunity to provide scoping comments on the proposal to
designate the Pacific Remote Islands (PRI) as a National Marine
Sanctuary including expanding boundaries and no fishing prohibitions
around Palmyra and Howland/Baker Islands.
HLA was established in 2000 to ensure the long-term continuity of
the Hawaii longline fisheries (deep-set targeting bigeye tuna; shallow-
set targeting swordfish) and associated seafood industry. HLA members
include all active Hawaii-based longline vessels and the daily Honolulu
Fish Auction. The Hawaii longline fisheries contribute over 85% of
Hawaii's commercial fish landings, making it Hawaii's largest
commercial fishing sector. With approximately 30 million pounds landed
annually--worth around $120 million in dockside value--the Hawaii
longline fleet is Hawaii's largest food producer by volume and value.
General Comments
The United States is a global leader in fisheries management. Under
a range of federal laws, overfishing is prevented, bycatch minimized,
and fisheries are not allowed to jeopardize endangered species
populations. Even with comprehensive fisheries management regimes, no
country has closed as much of its national waters to commercial fishing
as the United States. Nearly 1.2 million square miles of ocean--roughly
one third of the total land area of the United States including
Alaska--has been set aside and protected (and much of it within past 10
years).
The closure of US waters has been disproportionately focused in the
Pacific Islands region, where 96% (by area) of all US Marine Protected
Areas (MPA) have been established. Furthermore, these MPAs have not
only been established for vulnerable coral reef ecosystems, but
additionally for vast, blue-water pelagic environments around Hawaii,
American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands and the PRI--permanently
closed to highly monitored commercial fishing for migratory species
such as tuna.
The proposed PRI National Marine Sanctuary designation would expand
the fishing closures to the full extent of the US Exclusive Economic
Zone (EEZ) around Howland/Baker Islands and Palmyra Atoll/Kingman Reef.
The result would achieve President Biden's 30 x 30 America the
Beautiful Initiative with respect to the marine environment by closing
30% of the Nation's EEZ waters to commercial fishing. This begs the
question: is this proposal necessary for marine protection or does it
fulfill a political agenda?
Full closure of these US waters to highly monitored,
comprehensively regulated US fishing fleets does not strike a balance
between resource protection and sustainable use. Whether it's the need
to support local businesses, promoting US Pacific Island food self-
sufficiency, or countering China's influence, permanently closing
pelagic EEZ waters of the United States harms US strategic interests in
the region more than it helps.
Unfortunately, there are significant differences in views on the
benefits of closing all US waters of the PRI to fishing. Proponents
argue protection is needed to build resiliency against climate change,
promote cultural connections to these places, and to provide a refuge
for marine species. HLA supports these objectives but does not agree
that closing all US waters of the PRI is necessary or representative of
a balanced marine resource management regime.
One area of controversy is whether these MPAs have spillover
benefits to tuna stocks. Proponents are touting research published late
last year that ostensibly concludes Papahanaumokuakea Marine National
Monument expansion produced, in just two years, significant tuna
spillover benefits to immense populations of bigeye and yellowfin tuna
and resulted in higher catch rates in the Hawaii longline deep-set
fishery. That research was promptly renounced as flawed and debunked by
leading tuna stock assessment scientists.\1\ As fishermen, we know that
the ocean is dynamic, especially the pelagic environment where we fish.
While advocacy science may make such claims, discrete, static closures
will not have material benefits to abundant tuna stocks or populations
of other highly mobile species that range beyond US PRI EEZ boundaries.

medoff/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given this understanding, HLA has serious concerns with the claimed
benefits of the proposal, especially as they relate to tuna stocks. The
Hawaii longline fishery started in 1917 and Hawaii longline vessels
have a long history of fishing within the US EEZ waters around Johnston
and Palmyra, with some years seeing up to 20% of fishing effort. In
2014, the entire EEZ around Johnston Island was closed to fishing as
result of the PRI monument expansion by President Obama. Within the
last decade, Hawaii longline vessels have minimally fished in the open
area of US EEZ waters from 50 -200 nm around Palmyra. The Hawaii fleet,
which lands premium ice-chilled seafood, does not fish in the US EEZ
around Howland/Baker Islands due to it being over 1600 nm away from
Honolulu. For these reasons, the proposed Sanctuary and expansion will
likely result in minor direct impacts to the Hawaii longline fleet;
however, the main extent of impacts are cumulative and involve the
existing marine monument designations and a newly agreed international
convention that, among other things, establishes a framework for the
designation of MPAs on the high seas (BBNJ).\2\

Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological
Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction. 2023.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Approximately 65% of US EEZ waters around the Hawaii Archipelago
are permanently closed to commercial fishing. Currently, around 80% of
Hawaii longline fishing effort occurs in the high seas, which has
increased from historical levels due area closures. On the high seas,
Hawaii longline vessels fish along-side poorly monitored, subsidized
foreign vessels. One must ask, then, if closing US waters to commercial
fishing does not benefit tuna stocks or other abundant, mobile pelagic
species, then why is it in the US national interest to subject its
fishing fleets to foreign competition on the high seas?
Closing all US waters in the PRI is not consistent with NOAA's
National Seafood Strategy or the United States Indo-Pacific Strategy
which aims to counter China's rapidly growing influence in the Pacific
Islands region.\3\ China's closest partner in the region is Kiribati,
which happens to have the largest EEZ in the Pacific Ocean and its
waters produce the highest total tuna catch of any nation globally.\4\
Chinese flagged vessels fish unfettered within EEZ waters of Kiribati
(Figure 1). Three out five of the PRI (Palmyra, Howland/Baker, Jarvis)
are adjacent to the Kiribati EEZ.

The proposed Sanctuary overlay and expansion signals that the
United States is willingly ceding fisheries influence in the region to
China. Tuna fishing is the largest economic driver for many Pacific
Small Island Developing States. For example, over 70% of the Kiribati
Gross Domestic Product is from selling fishing access to its EEZ to
foreign vessels.\5\ China's offshore fishing fleets are heavily
subsidized, with tuna fishing a clear pathway to influencing Pacific
Island governments. This alone should give pause to the United States
with respect to the proposal.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another key geopolitical issue generating foreseeable cumulative
effects is the recently agreed BBNJ framework to establish high seas
MPAs. Because many Pacific Island countries receive critical economic
benefits from foreign fishing access agreements, closing large areas of
the high seas in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean supports their
economic interests. The combination of permanently closed US waters and
high seas MPAs, that either close existing fishing areas for our fleet
or displace and concentrate fishing effort into open areas, will have
significant impacts on the Hawaii longline fishery, negative impacts to
Hawaii's food self-sufficiency, and the broader National interest.
Foreign flagged longline vessels typically transship their frozen catch
on the high seas and stay on the fishing grounds for at least 6 to 12
months per trip, whereas Hawaii longline vessels return to port every 3
weeks (landing ice chilled fish for the local Hawaii market). High seas
transshipment activity is unmonitored, and this operational disparity
will result in foreign vessels occupying concentrated high seas fishing
grounds, leaving little area for the Hawaii-based fleet.
HLA understands that establishing a sanctuary over the PRI monument
is for Congressional funding and programmatic purposes, but why not use
the Antiquities Act of 1906 to expand the boundaries around Palmyra and
Howland/Baker? HLA believes that President Biden chose not to use the
Antiquities Act to expand the PRI monument boundaries due to concerns
over the legality of such action.\6\ The huge PRI monument expansion in
2014 using the Antiquities Act was too much then and the current
proposal to permanently close all PRI waters is too much now.
Unfortunately, the proposal appears to be more related to the 30 x 30
political agenda rather than meaningful protection.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\6\ In 2021, Chief Justice Roberts issued a statement related to
the case brought by the Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association
regarding Northeast Canyons Marine National Monument (Massachusetts
Lobstermen's Association, et al. v. Gina M. Raimondo, Secretary of the
Commerce, et al.). Chief Justice Roberts stated: ``While the Executive
enjoys far greater flexibility in setting aside a monument under the
Antiquities Act, that flexibility, as mentioned, carries with it a
unique constraint: ``Any land reserved under the Act must be limited to
the smallest area compatible with the care and management of the
objects to be protected. See Sec. 320301(b). Somewhere along the line,
however, this restriction has ceased to pose any meaningful restraint.
A statute permitting the President in his sole discretion to designate
as monuments ``landmarks,'' ``structures,'' and ``objects''--along with
the smallest area of land compatible with their management--has been
transformed into a power without any discernible limit to set aside
vast and amorphous expanses of terrain above and below the sea . . . We
have never considered how a monument of these proportions--3.2 million
acres of submerged land--can be justified under the Antiquities Act.
And while we have suggested that an ``ecosystem'' and ``submerged
lands'' can, under some circumstances, be protected under the Act, see
Alaska v. United States, 545 U.S. 75, 103 (2005), we have not explained
how the Act's corresponding ``smallest area compatible'' limitation
interacts with the protection of such an imprecisely demarcated concept
as an ecosystem. The scope of the objects that can be designated under
the Act, and how to measure the area necessary for their proper care
and management, may warrant consideration--especially given the myriad
restrictions on public use this purely discretionary designation can
serve to justify.'' https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/20-
97_jiel.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the reasons identified herein, HLA strongly believes the United
States national interests are best served if there is a balanced
management approach that includes both protection and sustainable
fishing. HLA would consider supporting the proposal if highly monitored
tuna fishing is allowed. Specifically, HLA would support Sanctuary
designation if fishing was allowed for highly migratory species by
Hawaii longline vessels within the US EEZ around Johnston from 50-200
nm. HLA also supports continued fishing opportunities for the US purse
seine fleet in the PRI noting the importance of their landings to
American Samoa.
Specific Comments
HLA requests that NOAA ensure the following topics are analyzed
thoroughly in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS).
1) Disproportionate Conservation Burden
Approximately 96% of no-take MPAs within the United States occur in
the US Pacific Islands region. Over 50% of US EEZ waters in the US
Pacific Islands Region are closed to commercial fishing from marine
monument designations in American Samoa, CNMI, Hawaii, and PRI. This
amounts to nearly 25% of all US waters nationally. No other region of
the US has been subject to such levels of US waters removed from highly
monitored, sustainable commercial fishing. The DEIS should analyze the
impacts resultant from the disproportionate conservation burden born on
residents and fisheries of the US Pacific Islands including Hawaii from
the designation of existing monuments and the proposed sanctuary
designation. Preventing the transfer of conservation burdens to Small
Island Developing States (SIDS) is an established principle in
international law, and similarly, the disproportionate burden placed on
fishing communities of Hawaii, American Samoa, CNMI, and Guam should be
analyzed in the DEIS.
2) Balancing Protection and Sustainable Fishing Opportunities
The Purpose and Policies section of the National Marine Sanctuaries
Act (16 U.S.C. Sec. 1431(b)(6) states: ``to facilitate to the extent
compatible with the primary objective of resource protection, all
public and private uses of the resources of these marine areas not
prohibited pursuant to other authorities.'' The DEIS should analyze how
the proposed designation is consistent with the National Marine
Sanctuary Act's provisions related to balancing protection and multi-
use of available natural resources, in particular sustainable fishing
activity. The analysis should take into account that currently all US
waters (0-200 nm) around Johnston, Wake, Jarvis Islands are closed to
commercial fishing, representing nearly 500,000 square miles of ocean.
The proposed designation would add an additional 200,000 square miles
and effectively close all US waters in the PRIA to commercial fishing.
Already the existing size of the PRI monument is larger than all US
national parks combined. The DEIS must address how the proposal
achieves balancing protection and sustainable use (e.g., highly
monitored fishing) of available resources per the National Marine
Sanctuaries Act.
3) Impacts to Tuna and Other Highly Migratory Species
The DEIS should analyze the potential impact, or lack thereof, that
Sanctuary designation and expansion would have on tuna populations in
the region. The DEIS should thoroughly analyze recent studies that
indicate MPAs offer little benefit to populations of highly migratory
species such as tuna and billfish. A recent paper by Meidoff et al.
(2023) purported to find that spillover occurred for yellowfin and
bigeye tuna as a result of the Papahanaumokuakea monument expansion.
However, this paper was quickly rebutted by world renown tuna
population and stock assessment scientists as being flawed. The
rebuttal is in press, but a summary can be found online.\7\ The DEIS
should also include reference to other peer-reviewed publications that
find MPAs have produced no discernable benefit to tuna stocks.\8\

responses to blue water MPAs. PLoS One, 15(7), e0235129.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Impacts to Coral Reef, Benthic and Pelagic Environments
As stated earlier, each of the PRI are either closed to the full
extent of the EEZ or from 0-50 nm (Howland/Baker and Palmyra Islands).
The DEIS should analyze how expanding the fishing closures will impact
each of these environments (i.e., nearshore, deep-sea benthic,
pelagic). For example, all of the PRI areas were considered pristine
before the closure of US waters to the full extent of the EEZ in 2014.
There were no environmental review processes under the National
Environmental Policy Act for any monument designation in the Pacific
Islands region. The DEIS should conduct a rigorous analysis on the
direct and indirect impacts of pelagic fishing for highly migratory
species by highly monitored fishing vessels on the affected
environment, with particular focus on coral reef, benthic, and pelagic
environments.
5) Indirect and Cumulative Impacts
NOAA should comprehensively analyze the indirect and cumulative
socio-economic effects of the proposal on the Hawaii longline fishery,
US purse seine fleet, fishing communities and economies of Hawaii,
American Samoa, Guam, and Northern Mariana Islands, and US seafood
markets. The analysis should also consider the proposal in combination
of existing MPA designations with reasonably foreseeable future high
seas MPAs under the BBNJ framework.
6) Administrative Costs
NOAA should analyze the anticipated administrative costs of a
potential sanctuary overlay and expansion of no fishing areas around
Palmyra and Howland/Baker Islands. The analysis should focus on
existing levels of Congressional appropriations for the National Marine
Sanctuary Program sites and the proposal's administrative costs of
enforcement, monitoring, and management.
Conclusion
HLA supports comprehensive fisheries management and science-based
marine conservation and protection. We strongly believe there should be
an appropriate balance between marine conservation, protection, and
sustainable fishing within US EEZ waters. To permanently close off all
fishing opportunities in US EEZ waters around the PRI is not in the
strategic interest of the United States in supporting the economies of
the US Pacific Islands or in deterring China's influence in the region.
Moreover, in an increasingly tight Congressional budget appropriations
environment, adding a sanctuary overlay and increasing administrative,
monitoring, and enforcement costs could take away from other existing
or proposed Sanctuary sites and MPAs.
Lastly, the disproportionate conservation burden placed on
residents and fisheries of the US Pacific Islands from existing marine
monument designations and the 30 x 30 political agenda is unfair and
needs to be rectified. Relatedly, allowing highly monitored fishing for
tuna within some EEZ waters of the PRI should be allowed and included
as a management alternative analyzed by NOAA in the DEIS.

Eric K. Kingma, Ph.D.

Abstract
Anti-Micronesian bias and colonialism are harming efforts to
protect and manage waters surrounding U.S. overseas territories in the
Pacific Islands. The Biden administration's proposal to designate a
national marine sanctuary in the Pacific Remote Islands Area (PRIA)
would potentially create the largest non-contiguous protected area on
the planet. However, the proposal is problematic because it has failed
to meaningfully include the Indigenous peoples who live closest to the
region and who have the strongest historical and cultural ties to the
islands--Micronesians and Samoans. The paper reviews the history and
context of the PRIA, who bears the costs and receives the benefits of
conservation there, and analyzes the perspectives and concerns of the
political and community leaders in the U.S. Pacific territories, who
have expressed near universal opposition to the plan. The paper
concludes with some recommendations for improving the equity and
justice of the proposal, such as engaging in meaningful dialogue,
respecting the rights and interests of the Indigenous peoples, and
ensuring their input and consultation in the decision-making process
and management of the PRIA.
Introduction
President Joe Biden of the United States has issued an ambitious
call to action through his ``America the Beautiful'' initiative to
conserve, connect, and restore 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by
2030 \1\ (sometimes referred to as 30x30). In terms of the ocean, this
means delivering conservation within the United States' exclusive
economic zones (EEZ)--the ocean area that extends 200 miles beyond
American coastlines.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 11.4 million square kilometers of ocean controlled by the
United States is vast. The U.S. territories in the Pacific in
particular have some of the largest EEZs in the country, making this
region critical for delivering conservation and climate goals on the
ocean. The U.S. Pacific territories are also the traditional lands and
waters of Indigenous Micronesians, Chamorros, Refaluwasch, and Samoans.
The combined ocean surrounding the U.S. Pacific territories is 3.3
million square kilometers--nearly twice the land area of Alaska--
accounting for 29 percent of the total EEZ of the entire United
States.\2\

The Pacific Remote Island Area (PRIA) consists of seven, mostly
uninhabited islands in the western and central Pacific Ocean claimed by
the United States. During the 20th century these islands were mostly
used for military purposes despite being designated as national
wildlife refuges.\3\ In 2009, President George W. Bush used the
Antiquities Act to designate 50 miles of waters surrounding each island
as the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. The marine
monument was expanded in 2014 by President Barack Obama and is under
consideration for further expansion by President Joe Biden.

On March 24, 2023, President Biden directed the Secretary of
Commerce to consider initiating the designation process for a proposed
national marine sanctuary in the PRIA,\4\ which would augment
protections for the existing marine monument. The proposed sanctuary
would expand protections to currently unprotected submerged lands and
waters to the full extent of the U.S. EEZ, growing the protected area
from 1.3 million sq km to nearly 2 million sq miles,\5\ potentially
making it the largest non-contiguous protected area on the planet. The
Biden administration has suggested that this action would achieve 30x30
on the ocean for the United States.\6\ The decision was celebrated by
leaders in Hawaii.\7\

Disconcertingly, the current campaign to expand and designate the
sanctuary in the Pacific Remote Islands has failed to meaningfully
include the Indigenous peoples who live closest to the region and who
have the strongest historical and cultural ties to the islands--
Micronesians and Samoans. Furthermore, while the conservation burden of
fishing restrictions is carried by the U.S. Pacific territories,\8\
most of the social and economic benefits have accrued to Hawai'i and
the continental United States in the form of conservation prestige,
jobs, research, and funding.\9\ This is not an equitable sharing of the
costs and benefits of marine protection, and leads to ``parachute
science and conservation'' \10\ in the territories.

The Biden administration defines ``environmental justice'' \11\ as
``the just treatment and meaningful involvement of all people,
regardless of income, race, color, national origin, Tribal affiliation,
or disability, in agency decision-making and other Federal activities
that affect human health and the environment so that people: (i) are
fully protected from disproportionate and adverse human health and
environmental effects (including risks) and hazards, including those
related to climate change, the cumulative impacts of environmental and
other burdens, and the legacy of racism or other structural or systemic
barriers; and (ii) have equitable access to a healthy, sustainable, and
resilient environment in which to live, play, work, learn, grow,
worship, and engage in cultural and subsistence practices.'' The people
living in the US Pacific territories, many of whom are Indigenous, did
not have meaningful involvement in the sanctuary designation process
prior to its announcement in March 2023.

As a result, political and community leaders in the U.S. Pacific
territories have proclaimed near universal opposition to the
plan.12,13 American Samoa Governor Lemanu Peleti Mauga said

This course of action is neither equitable nor just, and
antithetical to the America the Beautiful Initiative \16\ and the UN
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People's principle of Free,
Prior, and Informed Consent.\17\ For example, no government
representatives from the territories were invited to participate in the
March 24, 2023 White House event where the proposed sanctuary was
announced,\18\ nor were they informed ahead of time that a sanctuary
announcement was taking place,\19\ nor were they involved in designing
the first public comment period,\20\ or organizing federal public
hearings on their own islands.\21\ Months later, in September 2023, a
sanctuary designation workshop co-hosted by NOAA and the American Samoa
government was held, but issues of consent had not been yet addressed
as Governor Lemanu issued a memorandum directing participating
government staff to support ``the Governor's staunch opposition to the
marine sanctuary designation.'' \22\ Micronesians, Chamorros,
Refaluwasch, and Samoans should have input and consultation in every
step of the decision-making process and management of the Pacific
Remote Islands, and any proposals to change them, not after
announcements are made.

The United States needs to do a better job of engaging with
Indigenous people in the U.S. Pacific territories, and backing their
ideas to manage their waters, rather than forcing ideas on
them.23,24 Ultimately, these may be the same ideas, but the
process and the people involved matter.

The Biden administration must reassess the proposed plan as it was
developed without input from the Indigenous peoples living in the U.S.
territories. Without meaningful dialogue, a designation has the
potential to violate many of the conservation commitments the
administration has made towards Native peoples and will ultimately harm
conservation efforts in the region in the long term. Understanding the
history, culture, and context of these islands and surrounding waters
is critical for developing conservation policies that benefit local
people, and this is missing from the existing proposal. This essay
examines some of that context and offers a pathway towards Indigenous
led conservation that truly engages the Native people who have lived in
the Pacific for millennia, heals contemporary intra-Pasifika harm, and
concludes with the goal of decolonizing conservation in the Pacific
Remote Islands Marine National Monument.
Understanding Place and People in Historical Context
The specifics of how the Pacific Ocean basin, which occupies a
third of the earth's surface, was populated have been lost in time, but
cultural and linguistic studies have pieced together how voyagers over
centuries traversed thousands of kilometers of open ocean in dugout
canoes using only the stars, waves, and biological cues as their
guides.\25\ Recent Archaeological \26\ and paleoenvironmental \27\
evidence suggests humans reached the Mariana Islands, the first islands
to be populated, about 3,500-4,300 years ago, and from there
populations spread eastward across the Pacific. Traditionally, the
lines between Micronesia, Melanesia, and Polynesia never existed,\28\
as territories, cultures, and trade overlapped over distances of
thousands of kilometers.\29\

Over the last few centuries political borders in the Pacific
Islands were repeatedly redrawn and geographies renamed as the islands
were colonized, dominated, and ruled by foreign, often Western,
countries. Colonization goes back more than 500 years to when Magellan
visited the Marianas and committed the first act of European genocide
in the Pacific.\30\ Colonial rule of the region existed under Spanish,
German, Dutch, Japanese, British, and American empires. In 1893, the
U.S. Government backed and supported an illegal overthrow and
annexation of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Following World War II, many of
the islands in Micronesia were part of the Trust Territory of the
Pacific Islands, a United Nations trust territory administered by the
United States. Today, politically, Micronesia is politically organized
as a constellation of sovereign countries and U.S. territories. Some
islands were taken as a spoil of war or broke off from the Trust
Territory of the Pacific Islands to become what they are today. The
Republic of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of the
Marshall Islands, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the
Territory of Guam, and several of the PRIA islands (described in detail
in the following paragraphs) are either owned by or have compacts of
free association \31\ with the United States; They all use US postal
system and the US dollar as their currency. Republic of Nauru and
Republic of Kiribati have closer political and economic ties with
Australia. Guam is the largest and most developed island in the region.
All the islands in Micronesia have their own unique cultures and
history of colonization, with at least 20 Indigenous languages still
spoken across the region.

The Pacific Remote Islands, specifically, are all part of the
American empire as a result of a mid-nineteenth century law called the
Guano Islands Act of 1856,\32\ which was passed to help meet America's
demand for fertilizer to feed its growing population. The Guano Island
Act allowed that, ``Whenever any citizen of the United States discovers
a deposit of guano on any island, rock, or key, not within the lawful
jurisdiction of any other government, and not occupied by the citizens
of any other government, and takes peaceable possession thereof, and
occupies the same, such island, rock, or key may, at the discretion of
the President, be considered as appertaining to the United States.''

Geographically, Wake Island lies northwest of what is today the
Republic of the Marshall Islands. Howland and Baker border the Phoenix
Islands archipelago, while Kingman Atoll, Palmyra Atoll, and Jarvis
Island are part of the Line Islands. These political lines and place
names are all modern inventions; they have changed in recent history
and may change again. Midway Atoll, for example, was first claimed by
the United States using the Guano Islands Act, was considered part of
the PRIA for many years, but is now considered part of the Northwest
Hawaiian Islands.
Another example is Palmyra in the Line Islands, which was claimed
by the U.S. in 1859, but was later given up when no guano was found.
The island was later claimed by the Kingdom of Hawai'i in 1862. When
the US illegally overthrew the Kingdom of Hawai'i in 1893, Palmyra
became part of the Republic of Hawai'i, and then the Territory of
Hawai'i in 1898. But when Hawai'i became a state in 1959, Palmyra
remained a territory, which is why it is the only incorporated U.S.
Pacific territory, meaning it is part of the United States; as opposed
to the other territories, which are all owned by, but not part of, the
United States. The Nature Conservancy purchased the island from the
Fullard-Leo family in 2000 for $37 million.\33\

claim Wake Island. In 2016, the Marshalls made their claim formal when

With the 1979 Treaty of Tarawa, the US gave up claim to several
islands which today are part of the Republic of Kiribati. While this
treaty recognized Kiribati's sovereignty over 8 Phoenix Islands and 6
Line Islands, the US held on to the five nearby Pacific Remote Islands,
so that they could continue to be used for national defense purposes.
Four years later, in 1983, President Reagan claimed the US exclusive
economic zone, and the 200-mile ocean area surrounding each island came
under control of the US government, as well.
Except for Johnston Atoll, absent this history of colonization all
of the islands within the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National
Monument would today be a part of sovereign Micronesian nations. From
the perspective of the United States, these were unknown, unowned
islands, but this narrative of pristine, unpeopled lands is but an
extension of Manifest Destiny to the Pacific. Even the Catholic Church
has disavowed the legal and political Doctrine of Discovery, as it
fails to ``recognize the inherent human rights of Indigenous peoples.''
\35\ The Native people who owned and used these islands survive today,
living in the surrounding archipelagos.

Understanding Pacific Islander identity can be complicated. The
great Pacific scholar Epeli Hau'ofa was perhaps a bit idealistic when
he wrote, ``anyone who has lived in our region and is committed to
Oceania is an Oceanian,'' but he was correct in observing, ``our
present regionalism is a direct creation of colonialism,'' and that
``we have not been able to define our world and ourselves without
direct and often heavy external influences.'' \39\

Colonialism has historically pitted Indigenous peoples against one
another, and to avoid this today, when we explore our shared Pasifiku
histories, cultures, and identities, we must do so in a respectful and
intentional manner to ensure pluralistic advocacy encompassing multiple
perspectives. The value of the proposed sanctuary can and should be
interpreted through its connection to Hawai'i, but it must center its
connection to Micronesia.
In a letter to President Biden dated October 31, 2022, Hawaii
Representative Ed Case echoed the importance of including Native
Pacific voices beyond those in Hawai'i:
``Some stakeholders have expressed hesitancy with what has been to
this point a primarily Native Hawaiian-driven effort to protect the
cultural heritage of the PRIMNM expansion zone. To address the concerns
voiced by stakeholders throughout the Pacific, I especially encourage
you to continue to engage with all Indigenous communities tied to the
PRIs throughout the renaming process so that the importance of this
unique ecosystem place can be articulated and deeper connections to
this place can be forged.
While many of the most active voices in protecting the cultural
seascape of the PRIs are Native Hawaiian, protection of these islands
must be inclusive of Micronesian and Polynesian Indigenous communities,
including American Samoans, Chamorros and Native Hawaiians. The
expanded monument's proposed boundaries contain key areas in which the
diverse Indigenous peoples of the Pacific can connect with their shared
culture and history. We must consider its cherished cultural history
along with its ecological importance and scientific value.''

Mr. Moylan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
These detail strong oppositions at all levels from the
local and Indigenous people of the Pacific territories. Our
islands carry the burden of fishing restrictions, while the
social and economic benefits accumulate elsewhere. This is not
an equable approach to marine conservation and protection.
The continued policy of shutting out the voices of
territorial residents in the decision-making process is
shameful. In a recent meeting with the Western Pacific
Fisheries Management Council, this Administration approved a
plan to stop all longliner tuna quota transfer sales. Funds
raised from these quota sales are used to fund Guam's Marine
Conservation Plan. Preventing these sales endangers our ability
to protect our marine environments. This decision is incredibly
harmful to my district, and my constituents have repeatedly
requested that this policy be immediately reversed.
Chairwoman Mallory, can you please tell me and my
constituents why the Administration continues to pursue an
agenda that harms the Pacific territories and strips away their
own ability to protect local environments?
Ms. Mallory. I thank you, Congressman, for that question.
I think that the Administration is very much focused on
trying to ensure that we are engaging with and meeting the
needs of the Pacific remote island and territory communities.
Mr. Moylan. Chairwoman Mallory, I am sorry, we are short of
time. But one of the statements that came in in the proposals,
in the letter from Manny Duenas, President of the Guam
Fisheries Co-op, states that, ``But this proposed sanctuary is
unprecedented in size. It is more than 50 times larger than any
previous designated sanctuary. Furthermore, if anyone would
benefit from this sanctuary, it will be foreign fishermen
fishing just outside the sanctuary boundaries.''
Chairwoman Mallory, can you please tell me why this
Administration is so persistent in the designation of new
Pacific monuments and sanctuaries which hinders the development
of our essential Pacific territory fishery industries?
Ms. Mallory. Thank you, Congressman. I think the reason
that we have been focused on the Pacific remote island area is
because of its incredibly unique ecosystem and cultural
heritage, and I think that was the reason the President
directed the Commerce Department to initiate a sanctuary
process.
Mr. Moylan. Chairwoman, one of the other testimonies came
from three governors, the Governor from CNMI, Governor from
Guam, and the Governor from American Samoa. They said that this
would be devastating for our local tuna economy. And it has
direct conflict with the Biden administration's Indo-Pacific
economic framework. So, it is not working. We are not listening
here.
And Mr. Chairman, I know I am running out of time, but
basically, what our statements are saying here, what the
Administration is doing is completely different, to me, based
on all these testimonies, the proposal for sanctuary should be
dead in the water.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired. The Chair
recognizes the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Collins, for 5
minutes.
Mr. Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Director Mallory, it is good to see you again.
Ms. Mallory. Thank you.
Mr. Collins. Last year, I asked you a few questions about a
proposed rule in the sole selection of both carbon disclosure
project and science-based target initiatives to gatekeep
companies from participating as Federal contractors. And I have
to tell you, I was a little shocked when at one point you just
got to the point where you had no further comments.
Under a proposed rule which your office was heavily
involved in drafting, all major Federal contractors would have
to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions, and set emissions
reduction targets that must be validated and approved by an
international NGO known as the Science Based Target initiative,
or SBTi, in effect, outsourcing government responsibilities to
an outside foreign entity.
The SBTi has received criticism from some who argue there
is an inherent conflict of interest in both setting the
emission standards, while also charging customers a fee to
validate their emissions reductions target. So, yes or no, was
there a competitive process used in selecting SBTi as the sole
provider of emissions target validation?
Ms. Mallory. As part of the rulemaking, sir?
Mr. Collins. As part of a competitive process in selecting
SBTi, were they the sole source provider of the mission target
validation?
Ms. Mallory. Congressman, I believe that the letter that we
sent to the FAR Council that is actually doing the rule
identifies three entities.
Mr. Collins. I just ask, was there a competitive process
used to select----
Ms. Mallory. Not for the rulemaking. I don't know where----
Mr. Collins. I am talking about in selecting SBTi as the
sole provider.
Ms. Mallory. Right, but what I am saying is----
Mr. Collins. When you selected SBTi, was there a
competitive process for other people?
Ms. Mallory. And I don't think that (1) I am thinking that
they weren't selected, and that (2) they were one of three
entities that I think we recommended----
Mr. Collins. They are the ones that are handling the
responsibility of monitoring these people.
Ms. Mallory. There is not a competitive process that I am
aware of.
Mr. Collins. OK. Are you aware that a report by the
NewClimate Institute determined that several of SBTi's emission
assessments were contentious or inaccurate?
Ms. Mallory. I am not aware of that report.
Mr. Collins. Are you aware that one of the SBTi's founders
has accused them of having several conflicts of interest, and
of putting their own interests above the interests of the
public?
Ms. Mallory. I am not aware of this report.
Mr. Collins. Prior to selecting SBTi, did CEQ vet any of
these allegations?
Ms. Mallory. Congressman, as I said, CEQ's role was in
being part of sending a letter to the FAR Council that directed
them----
Mr. Collins. We are so short on time. Just yes or no.
Ms. Mallory. I don't have a yes or no on that. I don't know
the answer to that.
Mr. Collins. What about yes or no, are CEQ employees
required to recuse themselves from working on projects with a
prior employee?
Ms. Mallory. There is no blanket requirement like that.
They are required to meet the ethics requirements.
Mr. Collins. So, they are not required to recuse
themselves.
Ms. Mallory. It depends on what the ethics requirements
call for.
Mr. Collins. Are all CEQ employees bound by the Biden
ethics pledge?
Ms. Mallory. No, only certain employees.
Mr. Collins. Are you aware that at least one senior
official at CEQ had previously spent a decade working at Carbon
Disclosure Project?
Ms. Mallory. I am now aware of that, yes.
Mr. Collins. Last June, you highlighted in your testimony
that the Biden administration provided more than $1 billion to
make sure that agencies have the environmental review and
permitting experts they need. While I agree with you that
personnel can be a serious cause for delays, it isn't the main
problem. I have seen permit modifications in my district
essentially go through the NEPA process three or four times and
get hung up on a single solicitor's review.
Do you agree that duplicity within the NEPA is a
significant roadblock in the permitting process?
Ms. Mallory. Congressman, we have been focused on trying to
reduce any duplicative actions.
Mr. Collins. So, you do agree that there is----
Ms. Mallory. I don't know that I agree that it is a
significant roadblock.
Mr. Collins. Let's move on to energy policies on this
Administration. There is a common theme of this
Administration's energy policy, and it has been an attack on
low-income communities, the very people that they claim to be
protecting. Do you agree that low-income communities are
disproportionately impacted by policies that raise energy
prices?
Ms. Mallory. Yes.
Mr. Collins. If a GAO report were to suggest that the
policies coming from your agency disproportionately increased
energy prices and energy poverty amongst the most vulnerable
communities, would you rescind those policies?
Ms. Mallory. I would like to see the report, Congressman.
Mr. Collins. But that is what I am saying. If they----
Ms. Mallory. If they said it. It depends on what the basis
of the report was. I have read GAO reports that are not
reliable.
Mr. Collins. So, if they disproportionately increase the
energy prices and energy poverty among the most vulnerable
communities, you would rescind those policies.
Ms. Mallory. I would read the report and see if that was
appropriate.
Mr. Collins. But you would agree that if the policies of
the agency were disproportionately increasing the energy prices
and the energy poverty amongst our vulnerable communities, it
is just a basic question.
Ms. Mallory. I know, Congressman, but it is not a simple
answer.
Mr. Collins. You wouldn't rescind those----
Ms. Mallory. It is not a simple answer. I don't think there
is a blanket, across-the-board answer to that question.
Mr. Collins. I think if they were, that would be a pretty
easy answer.
Ms. Mallory. I think if they were, it would depend on
whether there were other tools that we had to address that.
Mr. Collins. That doesn't matter.
Ms. Mallory. I think if they were, yes, it does matter.
Mr. Collins. You can't address everything. You can only
address what is right in front of you. And that would be those
policies.
Ms. Mallory. Right. And I guess what I am saying is it
depends on the policy, it depends on the circumstances. There
is not an easy answer to that question.
Mr. Collins. Yes, I would agree. I think that is a common
theme, ``It depends,'' and that it is somebody else.
Sorry, Mr. Chairman, for going over, and I yield back.
The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired.
Chair Mallory, thank you for your testimony and thank the
Members for their questions today. The members of the Committee
may have some additional questions for the witness, and we will
ask you to respond to these in writing.
Under Committee Rule 3, members of the Committee must
submit questions to the Clerk by 5 p.m. on Tuesday, May 21. The
hearing record will be held open for 10 business days for these
responses.
If there is no further business, without objection, the

Submissions for the Record by Rep. Westerman

``After months of negotiations, the Biden Administration
has provided us with a tentative contract that would allow New
York to utilize Floyd Bennett Field as a shelter for asylum
seekers. Once the final agreement is signed, we will work with
Mayor Adams and his team to set up a Humanitarian Emergency
Relief and Response Center at Floyd Bennett Field with the
capacity to shelter more than 2,000 asylum seekers. We are
grateful to President Biden for his support of this initiative
and committed to continuing our advocacy on behalf of the
people of New York.
``Ultimately the path out of this crisis is granting work
authorization immediately, so these individuals can move out of
shelter and into independent living arrangements. This site
will be critical in the interim for the City of New York to
provide humanitarian aid, as we work collectively to get people
on the path to asylum seeker status and legal work.''

Decision Memorandum and Environmental Review to Support Emergency
Activities for Temporary Housing of Migrants
U. S. Department of the Interior National Park Service
Gateway National Recreation Area
Introduction
The National Park Service (NPS) is requesting alternative
arrangements for National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance
pursuant to 43 CFR 46.150(c) (emergency responses).\1\ As described
below, there is an urgent need to respond to a humanitarian crisis
caused by tens of thousands of migrants entering New York City (City)
and exceeding the City's capacity for temporary shelter. The Council on
Environmental Quality (CEQ) has concurred that there is an emergency
situation that can appropriately be addressed through the DOI NEPA
emergency procedures at 43 CFR 46.150.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ ``If the Responsible Official finds that the nature and scope
of the subsequent actions related to the emergency require taking such
proposed actions prior to completing an environmental assessment and a
finding of no significant impact, the Responsible Official shall
consult with the Office of Environmental Policy and Compliance about
alternative arrangements for NEPA compliance. The Assistant Secretary,
Policy Management and Budget or his/her designee may grant an
alternative arrangement. Any alternative arrangement must be
documented. Consultation with the Department must be coordinated
through the appropriate bureau headquarters.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The NPS is proposing to enter into one or more agreements, leases,
and other administrative arrangements in accordance with its
authorities to allow the City to use NPS lands for the purposes of
temporarily operating a migrant camp on Floyd Bennett Field (FBF)
within Gateway National Recreation Area (GATE or park). The impacts of
allowing such use are not expected to be significant, and therefore an
environmental assessment would be the appropriate NEPA compliance
pathway for this action. However, there is not time to complete an EA
before action must be taken to address imminent threats to human health
and safety. Consistent with guidance from the Council on Environmental
Quality (Emergencies and the National Environmental Policy Act Guidance
2020), the information contained herein, and the efforts to be taken
regarding the emergency action, the NPS proposes to comply with the
regulatory requirements for EA content, interagency coordination, and
public involvement to the extent practicable.
Background
New York City has seen an influx of approximately 100,000 migrants
in the past year and is currently housing more than 58,000 migrants in
City shelters. The City has utilized areas such as soccer fields,
recreation centers, and parking lots to house migrants, but lacks
additional space and resources to meet current needs. The influx of
migrants has led to overcrowding in existing facilities, instances of
migrants being forced to sleep on sidewalks and other public areas, and
in some cases unsanitary conditions. Taken together, the situation has
resulted in threats to health and safety of migrants and others. The
State of New York has declared a Disaster Emergency as a result of the
large number of migrants, stating, ``federal support is critical to
support the City of New York and other local governments within the
State that lack the infrastructure, facilities, and resources necessary
to meet the immediate humanitarian demand to house and meet other basic
needs of the large numbers of migrant arrivals related to the large
influx of migrants'' (see New York State Executive Order 28).
Purpose and Need
The purposes of taking action are: 1) to allow New York City to
operate a temporary shelter to provide housing and other services for a
limited number of migrants; and 2) to make certain improvements to
Floyd Bennett Field that ensure its preservation, repair and
rehabilitation and will contribute to its long-term visitor use and
enjoyment.
Action is needed to alleviate risks related to health and safety of
migrants and others and to assist the City in meeting migrant needs.
GATE has historic resources available for lease that can assist the
City in meeting those needs, as well as its own need to make certain
improvements to the historic property at Floyd Bennett Field.
Proposed Action
The 1,450-acre Floyd Bennett Field Historic District is the largest
single publicly owned, managed, and accessible under-developed parcel
of land in New York City (National Register Form 2010). Floyd Bennett
Field opened in 1931 as the site of New York City's first municipal
airport. In 1942, it was transferred to the Navy and became Naval Air
Station--Brooklyn. The Navy decommissioned the airfield in 1971, and in
1972, most of the land was transferred to the National Park Service as
a unit in Gateway National Recreation Area. The site was originally one
of many marsh islands in Jamaica Bay. Extensive fill was placed on the
site from the 1920s through 1940s to create the largely anthropogenic
landform that is exists today. The site was most densely developed
during the World War II era. Many of the buildings and structures at
the site today are unoccupied and in varying degrees of disrepair or
ruin. It is an expansive landscape characterized by open fields,
extensive areas of concrete and asphalt pavement, young second-growth
thickets and woods, engineered and natural shorelines, and a variety of
buildings clustered into what were historically flight-path clear
zones.
The NPS will enter into a lease agreement with the City for a
period of one year with an initial period of ninety days. The lease
agreement will allow the City to take actions necessary to provide
occupation and use of the areas specified in Figure 1 for the purpose
of housing up to 2,000 migrants.

Figure 1. Floyd Bennett Field, Gateway National Recreation
Area, Brooklyn, NY identifying runaway 19, a portion of the Hanger B/
Sea-Plane Parking Lot, and two (2) Campground areas.
The lease agreement will also include requirements for site
improvements of certain areas within FBF as public benefits (see Figure
2). Some of the site improvements will be completed at the end of, or
after, the up to 12-month emergency action period. For the purposes of
this document, ``emergency action'' refers to actions related to
controlling the immediate impacts of the emergency, which are fully
covered by these NEPA emergency alternative arrangements. This
generally includes construction, improvements to existing
infrastructure, and placing new temporary infrastructure to allow
occupancy of the site; operation and administration of the site; and
associated actions related to health and safety of individuals within
the project area. Planned future improvements (follow-on actions) are
actions that will provide public benefits and that will not be
immediately implemented. Although follow-on actions are included in
this document, related impacts are assessed at a ``programmatic''
level. The NPS has time to complete site-specific NEPA compliance for
follow-on actions and will do so as necessary before implementing any
follow-on actions.

Figure 2. Location of emergency actions required to provide
safe access for and administration of the migrant housing (projects 1,
4, 5 and some elements of project 2) and follow-on actions (projects 2
and 3) at Floyd Bennett Field, Gateway National Recreation Area,
Brooklyn, NY.
Throughout the duration of the proposed action, the NPS will
provide oversight of operations on FBF concerning the temporary housing
of migrants. The NPS Director (or designee) will retain command
oversight of the park's facilities and operations, balancing the City's
requirements against impacts to the park's mission. All modifications
to real property will require pre-approval from the NPS and will be
submitted to the GATE superintendent for approval. The City and its
agents will be held accountable for the protection of park resources to
include natural and cultural resources identified in various NPS
management plans.
Temporary facilities will be constructed to support a maximum
initial occupancy of 2,000 residents plus additional support personnel
to provide shelter, food services, restrooms, showers, clothing,
medical, security, laundry, and associated needs. Migrants will be
housed in tent-based structures. All facilities will be constructed in
a temporary and removable fashion. Facilities will be designed in a
resilient manner or will be able to be quickly demobilized in
anticipation of major weather events. Based upon facilities constructed
at other locations, NPS anticipates that 4-8 winterized tents similar
in size to the airplane hangars at FBF will be installed to support the
2,000 residents. Facilities will be arranged and anchored in a manner
that minimizes impacts to natural and cultural resources. To the
greatest extent possible, tents will be secured using sandbags, water
ballast or similar materials. Staking will be minimized and will avoid
areas with sensitive resources. Throughout the duration of the proposed
action, the City will be responsible for providing and managing
utilities (including water, wastewater, and power), security, food,
clothing, medical, security, custodial services, solid and hazardous
waste, and grounds maintenance, as necessary. Medical staff will be
under the direction of the designated Lessee's Chief Medical Officer or
medical coordinator. The City may station an emergency medical service
unit at the site as required. The disposal of all medical waste will be
coordinated with appropriate NPS representatives and will meet all
applicable regulatory requirements.
The City will provide 24-hour law enforcement (security services)
scaled appropriately to accommodate the number of migrants and the size
and complexity of the camp. The New York Police Department will be the
primary entity responsible for law enforcement issues involving
migrants. The City will provide enhanced 24-hour law enforcement and
security at locations identified by the NPS Director sufficient to
protect park visitors and park resources. During park closure hours
this will include staffing the security gate at the entrance to FBF.
The NPS will identify sites within the proximity of the project area
that pose an elevated safety risk with a high density of people
residing in the park 24-7, including unoccupied and deteriorating
buildings as well as contaminated sites. The City will be required to
mitigate those risks through fencing, security cameras, and other
security measures. To the greatest extent possible, fencing will be
secured using sandbags, water ballast or similar materials. Any ground
disturbance related to fencing will be temporary in nature and wiU
avoid areas with sensitive resources. Temporary lighting will be
installed in locations throughout the area in order to ensure safety
and deter crime. To the greatest extent possible, new lighting will be
Night Sky compliant. In some locations, such as near the visitor center
and other structures, lighting will remain on at all times after
sundown.
The City will make arrangements for all required utilities,
including gas, electricity, other power, water, cable, telephone,
sewage, waste removal, and other communication services. The City will
manage all water and wastewater facilities in a containerized manner as
the City will not be permitted to connect to NPS utilities, which are
not sized to accommodate additional capacity. The City will provide
electrical services which may include on-site generators or other
temporary installations. The City will manage all fuel in a
containerized manner as the City will not be permitted to utilize NPS
fuel services, which also are not sized to accommodate additional
capacity. All fuel facilities will have secondary containment. In the
event the City generates, processes, disposes of, or handles any
hazardous substances and hazardous materials, the City will ensure
removal, remediation, or other corrective action mandated by either the
State or Federal regulatory authority and adhere to all relevant
regulatory requirements related to hazardous substances and hazardous
materials. The City is not authorized to operate the site for storage
of hazardous materials.
The City will improve traffic circulation, parking, and access to
the site by reestablishing the historic entrance to the FBF at the Ryan
Visitor Center, improving the Hangar B/Sea-Plane Ramp Parking Lot, and
performing repairs on approximately 12,000 linear feet of main access
routes throughout the project area. As identified in the 2006 Jamaica
Bay Transportation Studies and 2014 General Management Plan (GMP), the
original entrance to the municipal airport from Flatbush Avenue will be
re-opened at the Ryan Visitor Center. Re-opening the diagonal entrance
drives requires a circulation plan, striping, security mechanisms for
the gates, gate repair, hardscape repair or repaving of the surface,
minor curb modifications, and landscaping. The park coordinated with
The New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) on their design
and reconfiguration ofFlatbush Avenue to accommodate this use. NYCDOT
has already altered the pavement markings and signage on Flatbush
Avenue to allow for reopening of the Ryan Visitor Center entrance
drives. Re-opening of the diagonal entrance drives is identified in the
Cultural Landscape Report for Floyd Bennett Field (Cody and Auwaerter
2009) as the most historically appropriate location for new entrances
from Flatbush Avenue into the Historic District.
At the Hangar B/Sea-Plane Ramp Parking Lot, work will include
removing a large debris pile adjacent to the site, removing invasive
trees and vegetation, planting native species, replacing fencing, jack
mudding sunken slab sections, and concrete patching. Consistent with
the 2014 GMP, the 12 adjacent RV camping sites will be upgraded to
include electrical hookups and striping. The parking lot area is a non-
contributing structure within the Historic District.
Throughout FBF, approximately 12,000 linear feet of main access
routes will be improved to facilitate traffic for equipment delivery,
administration, and migrant housing. Immediate improvements will be
needed to correct drainage issues where water is ponding on Runway Road
15-33, parallel to Flatbush Avenue. Existing asphalt roadway will be
milled and top coated. Existing concrete areas will be mud jacked and
patched as necessary. The City will be responsible for not only
addressing any impacts that result from their use but for general
improvements to these access routes for the benefit of the public.
The NPS and the City will develop a full site plan for how the
project area relates to other public areas and operations of FBF. The
NPS may limit migrant, City personnel, and/or contractor access to some
park areas and/or amenities as necessary to provide visitor safety and/
or to protect park resources. Movement of City personnel, contractors,
and visitors to the mission site will be restricted to direct movement
between the main entrance to FBF (from Flatbush Avenue just north of
the Marine Parkway Bridge) to the project area and return when exiting
GATE. Any movement outside this direct travel route must be coordinated
with the NPS. During hours the park is open, migrants will be permitted
to use the park following the same rules as other visitors. During
closure hours, migrants will not be permitted in areas of the park that
are not part of the project area.
When use of the project area ends, the City will remove all
temporary facilities, alterations and additions related to the
operation and administration of temporary migrant housing and restore
the area at a minimum, to as good of a condition that existed prior to
the commencement of the emergency action. Alterations, betterments,
additions and improvements that are made to reestablish the historic
entrance to the FBF at the Ryan Visitor Center, to improve safety and
use of the Hangar B/Sea-Plane Ramp Parking Lot, and to improve
approximately 12,000 linear feet of main access routes will remain
after the use of the project area ends. Additional compliance may be
required for other improvements or requirements specified in the
proposed by the City throughout the period of the lease. Any changes to
the proposed action will be subject to NEPA compliance, as appropriate.
Compliance for planned future improvements is addressed in the
``Follow-on Actions'' section of this memorandum.
Mitigation Measures
Pursuant to the terms of the lease, the City will be responsible
for developing a number of plans to address and incorporate the
specific issues and mitigation measures listed below, as applicable.
The lease agreement contains additional mitigation measures and plan
requirements that, although not specifically listed below, are
incorporated by reference into this memorandum.
1. All City personnel and contractor employees must utilize routes
specifically designated by NPS. The City, in coordination
with NPS Director, will develop a transportation plan to
include ingress and egress to the project area, parking,
pick-up and drop-off locations, and operational schedules.
2. Visitor access to the project area will be limited. A formal
request for visitation to the project area will be made to
and approved by NPS based on a City-provided ``need to
access assessment'' after coordination with all appropriate
NPS entities. All visitors to the project area will be
escorted by a City representative. This includes, but is
not limited to, Congressional staff, media, and non-
governmental organizations.
3. NPS will limit migrant, City personnel, and/or contractor access
to some park areas and/or amenities as necessary to provide
visitor safety and/or to protect park resources.
4. The City will comply with all requirements derived from completion
of federally required consultations and compliance,
including National Historic Preservation Act Section 106,
Endangered Species Act Section 7, Coastal Zone Management
Act, and Floodplain Statement of Findings.
5. All vertical structures/facilities built or installed on NPS
property will comply with applicable building code
requirements to include wind loads.
6. The City will develop a trash and recycling plan. This will
include actions to minimize single use plastics to protect
park resources. Best management practices will be employed
to manage and secure trash at all times.
7. The City will develop a food services plan to include food
distribution, food storage, food security, cooking
facilities, cold storage, etc. The City will be responsible
for ensuring food is managed in a centralized facility and
will be responsible for ensuring all food handling meets
federal standards.
8. The City will develop a pest management plan for review and
approval of the NPS Director prior to occupancy. The plan
will conform to NPS laws, regulations, and policies for
integrated pest management, and any chemicals used must be
approved by NPS.
9. The City will develop a detailed storm management plan for review
and approval of the NPS Director. This plan will identify
how the City will address how temporary facilities and
other property will be removed from the project area within
48 hours of an evacuation notice.
10. The City will develop a detailed emergency evacuation plan for
review and approval of the NPS Director. The plan will
describe how the site will be evacuated in the event an
emergency evacuation order is issued.
11. The City will develop a stormwater pollution protection plan to
include erosion control associated with all construction
and any potential overflow into Jamaica Bay related to the
proposed action. Best management practices will be employed
to prevent migration of construction materials, debris, and
sediment from entering the waterways. Seed-free straw bales
must be deployed for sediment/erosion control.
12. The City will develop an air quality management plan for review
and approval of the NPS Director. The City will submit to
the NPS all air quality monitoring reports that may be
required by regulatory agencies in conjunction with
activities associated with the Premises, such as the use of
generators. Any generators utilized on the Premises must be
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Tier IV (Tier 4)
compliant and must be permitted by the appropriate
regulatory agencies.
13. The City will monitor noise levels associated with generator
operations to ensure that the noise levels identified in
the GATE Superintendent's Compendium of 60 decibels, at 50
feet from the source, are not exceeded.
14. The City will develop a lighting management plan. The City will
ensure sufficient lighting to deter crime both on the
Premises and at secondary locations the NPS deems to be
appropriate to protect resources. While safety will remain
the first priority for the lighting plan, the City will
make every effort to comply with NPS Management Policies
2006 (Section 4.10) best practices on lightscape management
in national parks.
15. The City will develop a Spill Prevention, Control and
Countermeasures Plan. The City will immediately notify the
NPS and other applicable regulatory entities of any
unauthorized releases or the deployment of any
countermeasures.
16. All machinery containing fuels and oils shall have a spill kit
available immediately in the event of a spill. In the event
of a fuel or oil leak/spill, the work shall cease
immediately, spill containment deployed, and NPS Dispatch
(phone: 718-354-4700) and other jurisdictional authorities
called immediately, as designated.
17. Excess drilling fluids, slurry, and spoils must be contained until
disposed of in compliance with local ordinances,
regulations, and environmentally sound practices in an
approved disposal site.
18. Unless otherwise specified by the NPS, all removed material is to
be disposed of outside the park at an approved landfill,
recycled, or disposed of at other locations in accordance
with federal, state, and local regulations.
19. All areas of soil disturbance resulting from the permitted
activity must be stabilized immediately following project
completion.
20. Intact native topsoil from the project area shall be retained
whenever feasible. Should additional fill be needed, all
fill must be of quality suitable for use in a National Park
Unit. The City will submit material certificates for
imported backfill and fill materials before delivery to
document park approval of source and quality in accordance
with applicable standards.
21. Any new soils/sediment brought on site must be tested and meet New
York State Department of Environmental Conservation
standards for general fill (6 CRR-NY 360.13). Any fill
materials required for the project must be obtained from a
park-approved source. Soils should not be amended.
22. The City will provide documentation that all imported soils and
materials (such as straw bales, mulch, seed mixes,
plantings) are clean of contaminants and free of exotic
seeds and spores.
23. The City will submit certificate(s) of inspection for species and
areas subject to quarantine rules (such as but not limited
to 1 CRR-NY III C 142) to demonstrate compliance with
applicable Federal, state, and local laws, requirements,
and NPS policies.
24. Except for the project work described in this document and the
lease agreement, the City may not cut any timber or remove
any other landscape features such as shrubs or bushes
without prior written approval from the NPS.
25. Site use controls (e.g., temporary fencing) and improved signage
will be used to direct visitor use to authorized areas and
authorized trails to limit impacts on vegetation and
wildlife.
26. Any wheel ruts, holes or divots in lawn areas caused by the work
will be repaired. Any bare soil areas created by the work
will be seeded with annual ryegrass and a native grass seed
mix designed for the Northeast US region, where needed to
restore the area to pre-construction condition. Seed will
be applied at a rate of \1/2\ pound per 1,000 square feet
unless otherwise required for compliance with applicable
standards. The park's Resource Stewardship Division must
approve all plant selections before they are purchased.
27. The City will use native plant species that are as closely related
genetically and ecologically as possible to park
populations. For GATE, the operational definition for
closely related native species is plant material from seeds
or cuttings that were collected from native plant species
within 10 miles of the ocean anywhere along the coasts of
New Jersey, Staten Island, and western Long Island.
Substitution of plant material will be made only bas d on
proof of unavailability. The NPS must approve all plant
selections before they are purchased.
28. Care will be taken not to disturb any wildlife species (reptiles,
migratory birds, raptors, or bats) found nesting,
hibernating, estivating, or otherwise living in, or
immediately nearby, worksites.
29. If exterior project work will be implemented during period of
April 1 to September 1, NPS must be notified in advance and
the City may be required to have a qualified biologist
conduct an inspection of the work area prior to initiating
work to determine if there is any nesting activity that
could be impacted by the project. If nest building begins,
birds must not be harassed in any manner to deter nesting
activity. Park approval is required prior to placement of
any structures to deter nesting.
30. Any park infrastructure impacted during construction, including
but not limited to paved and unpaved roadways, walkways,
turf, will be restored to pre-construction conditions upon
completion of the project.
31. Best management practices for communication tower design,
sighting, construction, operation, maintenance, and
decommissioning will comply with United States Fish and
Wildlife Service 2016 guidelines (see https://us-
fcc.app.box.com/s/sc1742pnyc7w14vzzhcz3hrkoft1gn31).
Existing Condition of Resources and Potential Environmental Impacts
In addition to the resources discussed below, the NPS used CEQ's
Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool to determine whether there
are any disadvantaged communities that would be disproportionately
affected by the proposed action. While some disadvantaged communities
exist outside of the project area and outside of GATE, no disadvantaged
communities would be disproportionately affected by the proposed action
due to their distance from the project area.
The following discussion of impacts presumes application of the
mitigation measures included above, as applicable.
Air Quality
Floyd Bennett Field is in Kings County, New York, which is part of
the New Jersey-New York-Connecticut Interstate Air Quality Control
Region (40 CFR Sec. 81.13). The air basin is a shared resource and
impacts on it come from regional sources. Current air quality
conditions at FBF are poor for several indicators, including all three
indicators evaluated by the NPS: ozone, wet deposition, and visibility.
Kings County is designated by USEPA as serious nonattainment for the
2008 8-hour ozone (03) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS)
and as moderate nonattainment for the 2015 8-hour 03 NAAQS. Kings
County is also designated as maintenance for carbon monoxide (CO) and
particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 microns in diameter
(PM2.5) and unclassified/attainment for all other criteria pollutants
(USEPA 2020).
Temporary operation of heavy equipment; workers commuting to and
from the project area in personal vehicles; heavy duty diesel vehicles
hauling materials, water, wastewater, and debris to and from the
project area; operation of generators to power the temporary
facilities; and the potential for bus services for migrants to travel
to and from the project area would contribute to air quality impacts.
Particulate matter air emission would be produced by the combustion of
fuels. Particulate matter emissions from fugitive dust would be
minimized through minimal ground disturbance and use of hardscapes.
Portable facilities and other sustainable design techniques would
minimize the need for permanent construction and its related air
quality impacts.
In its GMP, the park evaluated the impacts of creating a wetlands
center at FBF. This included the use of heavy equipment for excavating,
grading, and construction. The GMP concluded that the very intense
construction related to the wetlands center, requiring 30 to 50 trips
by heavy-duty trucks each day for a 6-month period would contribute
between 0.25 and 0.5 ton of hydrocarbons, 1.3 and 2.3 tons of carbon
monoxide, and 6 and 10 tons of nitrogen oxides. The GMP concluded that
those levels of emissions would be small in the context of overall air
quality at FBF. The air quality impacts expected from construction
related to the wetlands center are far greater than the impacts that
would occur from the temporary construction and operation activities
under the proposed action.
Generators used under the proposed action would be permitted by
appropriate regulatory agencies and would meet EPA Tier 4 emissions
standards in order to minimize impacts to air quality. The City will be
required to develop an Air Quality Management Plan and submit air
quality monitoring reports, as appropriate, to the NPS.
The park would potentially diminish its contribution to greenhouse
gases by restoring native vegetation as part of emergency and follow-on
actions, including removal of non-native vegetation and planting of
appropriate native vegetation (Figure 2 projects 2, 3 and 4), thereby
offsetting the cumulative degradation of air quality from regional
sources. Overall, air quality impacts would be minimal, temporary, and
localized.
Cultural Resources
Floyd Bennett Field Historic District was listed on the National
Register of Historic Places in 1980 with 15 contributing resources and
a period of significance from 1928 to 1931. In 2010, the district was
expanded to include 94 contributing resources and a period of
significance from 1928 to 1945. It is significant under Criterion A at
the national level in the area of Transportation for its role in early
aviation history. It is also significant at the national level under
Criterion C in the areas of Architecture and Engineering for its
collection of buildings and structures embodying the characteristics of
both early-twentieth-century civil aviation facility design and World
War II-era military construction. Today the site consists of Art Deco
hangars, paved runways and taxiways, and the Ryan Center, a 42,000-
square foot Georgian Revival administration building with an attached
control tower. FBF also contains numerous structures from the WWII era
such as barracks, utility buildings, warehouses, and maintenance
facilities. The civil and military aviation history resources at FBF as
well as pre-contact and historic archeological sites are identified as
important park resources and values in the 2014 GMP.
The Historic District is a largely anthropogenic landform that was
transformed during the 1920s and 1930s through extensive grading and
landfilling to develop New York's first municipal airport. In 1941, FBF
was transferred to the Navy and became the Naval Air Station-Brooklyn.
In the early 1940s, the Navy expanded the airfield from 387 acres to
more than 1,200 acres. Over 100 new buildings and structures were
constructed including runways, taxiways, new hangars, offices,
workshops, storage and maintenance facilities, barracks, mess halls,
and other support structures. It was the busiest Naval Air Station in
America during World War II and was in use until 1967. The Navy
decommissioned the airfield in 1971, and in 1972, most of the land was
transferred to the NPS as a unit in GATE.
Runway 6-24 (New) (built 1942, LCS #041264, NYSHPO #04701.014793,
contributing structure) is located along the northern edge of the
airfield. It was built by the Navy in asphalt in 1942 and initially
measured 5,000 feet long and 300 feet wide. In 1960 it was lengthened
to 5,800 feet with a concrete extension at its east end that required a
small area of fill into Jamaica Bay. Runway 6 is the only runway that
presently retains most of its historic circulation pattern. Runway 6 is
identified as the location for the migrant housing (Figure 2).
Access routes required for equipment delivery and administration of
the migrant housing include the Main Entrance Road, Barracks Road
Complex, Runway 15-33 (Taxiway 10), Taxiways 1 and 2 (the original
Runway 6-24), and Taxiway 6 (Figure 2). The Main Entrance Road (built
ca. 1951, non-contributing structure) consists of the main public
entrance to FBF from Flatbush Avenue to the Main Entrance Gate House
and Entrance Guard Booth. The Barracks Road Complex (built ca. 1942,
contributing structure) is a system of paved roads through the barracks
area. The central road of the Barracks Road Complex, Floyd Bennett
Boulevard, runs east-west through the center of the barracks area from
the main entrance and continues north to connect with the Naval
Aviation Patrol Base Access Road. Runway 15-33 (Taxiway 10) (built
1930-1945, LCS #041264, NYSHPO #04701.014793, contributing structure)
defines the western boundary of the airfield, extending north to south
parallel to Flatbush Avenue and the Hangar Row Apron. One of the two
runways original to the municipal airport, it presently serves as the
main public entrance road to Hangar Row. The present asphalt road was
built on top of the original runway, running roughly along the
centerline, and taking up approximately one-quarter of the runway
surface. The historic runway surface remains intact beneath and to
either side of the road. Taxiways 1 and 2 (original Runway 6-24, built
1930-1935, contributing structure) extend perpendicularly from Runway
15-33 (Taxiway 10) just south of the Administration Building/Passenger
Terminal (Ryan Visitor Center) to Taxiway 6. Taxiway 1 forms the
eastern half and Taxiway 2 the western half of the original Runway 6-
24. Taxiway 6 (built 1942, contributing structure) is part of the
taxiway system developed during War II for circulation around the
periphery of the airfield. Taxiway 6 is surfaced in asphalt and is now
used as a road.

Figure 3. Floyd Bennett Field National Historic District
National Register Base Map (from National Registration Form 2010).
Runway 1-19 (built 1935-1942, LCS #041265, NYSHPO #04701.014792,
contributing structure) crosses the airfield diagonally from the
southwest to the northeast comers (Figure 1 area Band Figure 3). Runway
19 was originally 3,500 feet long and 150 feet wide with a concrete
surface. In 1942 it was widened to 300 feet with concrete extensions
and lengthened to 5,000 feet, using asphalt at the north end where it
intersects Runway 6.
The Airport Entrance Site (built 1932-2006) is a contributing site.
The Airport Entrance Drives (built ca. 1932, LCS #041260, associated
feature) consist of two diagonal drives from Flatbush Avenue that frame
a central lawn area and converge in front of the Administration
Building/Passenger Terminal (currently the Ryan Visitor Center) at the
Airport Entrance Central Parking Lot (Figure 4). The drives are
surfaced in asphalt and edged by concrete curb. The upper ends of the
drives are currently closed off with black metal picket fencing.

Figure 4. Floyd Bennett FieldAirport Entrance Detail Map (from
National Registration Form 2010).
The Naval Aviation Patrol Base Apron Extension (built ca. 1952,
non-contributing structure) and Naval Aviation Patrol Base Apron
Taxiways (built ca. 1952, non-contributing structure) (Figure 1 area C)
are adjacent to the Naval Aviation Patrol Base Apron (built 1940-1942,
contributing structure), Naval Aviation Patrol Base Seaplane Ramp
(built ca. 1942, LCS #174, contributing structure), and Naval Aviation
Patrol Base Hangar B (built ca. 1942, LCS #100, contributing building)
(Figure 3). The Naval Aviation Patrol Base Apron Extension is currently
used as a parking lot with the Naval Aviation Patrol Base Apron
Taxiways used as access routes to the parking lot.
While there are no documented precontact or historic archeological
sites in the area of potential effect, there is the potential for these
resources to be encountered in marshy areas buried below the average 9
feet of fill that comprises the airfield. The southern portion of the
current airfield boundaries, however, incorporates what were formerly
the upland boundaries of Barren Island, a highly desirable settlement
location during both the pre- and post-contact periods. Comprising well
drained soils, an abundance of subsistence resources, proximity to
fresh water, and high ground overlooking the Atlantic to the south and
prime marshland hunting locations to the north, the island would have
been a locus of settlement beginning with the stabilization of sea
level during the latter half of the Early Archaic Period through the
19th and 20th century residential and industrial development.
The proposed action would not authorize any penetration or
alteration of Runway 6 or 19 for construction and administration of the
migrant housing. All structures would be free-standing or secured with
water filled ballast or like materials. No penetration of the historic
runway or any hardscape is authorized. Repair to approximately 12,000
linear feet of main access routes would correct drainage issues on
historic runways and taxiways through mud jacking and patching of
existing concrete areas and milling and top coating of existing
asphalt. Rehabilitation of the historic entrance to the municipal
airport, removal of invasive vegetation, and planting of appropriate
native species will enhance the cultural landscape. Ground disturbance
will be limited to staking to a depth of less than thirty inches and
will be authorized only in NPS-approved areas. The lease does not
authorize any digging or trenching. The lease requires that all
existing cultural resources and landscape features must be protected
from damage or injury and that no actions can be taken that are
detrimental to the historical resources. The NPS-collected August 2023
photo points are included as an Appendix to the lease to document pre-
project conditions. An August 2023 evaluation of List of Classified
Structures (LCS) within or adjacent to the proposed project area was
also completed to document baseline conditions of park cultural
resources. While the NPS does not anticipate that the proposed
emergency action would have any adverse effects on cultural resources,
in accordance with 36 CFR Part 800.12(b)(2), the NPS will notify the
New York State Historic Preservation and Tribal Historic Preservation
Offices of the Delaware Nation, Delaware Tribe, Stockbridge-Munsee
Community, Shinnecock Nation and Shawnee Tribe, and the Advisory
Council on Historic Preservation of the emergency situation and will
initiate consultations as appropriate.
The NPS finds that the proposed action would not have adverse
impacts on cultural resources. Temporary impacts on the viewshed would
be expected. Reopening the Airport Entrance Site, repairs to the
runways, removal of invasive species, and planting of appropriate
native species would benefit the cultural landscape and improve the
conditions of the historic district and could help to offset any of the
project's temporary impacts. The effects of the project on cultural
resources will be fully evaluated under emergency procedures of Section
106 and any as yet unidentified adverse effects would be mitigated.
Wetlands, Floodplains, and Flooding
FBF is a mostly man-made conglomerate of dredged fills, fly ash,
garbage, and other urban fill. Some of the North Forty (the western
portion) is also underlain with rubble or other urban materials. The
western portion of the North Forty includes one 0.70-acre of a
freshwater pond and two freshwater forested/shrub wetlands (9.02 acres
total), with the nearest located 185 feet from northern edge of Runway
6. Tidal wetlands are located along the shoreline of Jamaica Bay,
including low salt marsh type located north of Hangar B parking lot
that is critically imperiled statewide. No impacts to any site wetlands
are anticipated from the proposed action, including proposed
rehabilitation work for public benefit.
Site elevation is highest in the western portion of Floyd Bennett
Field, near Flatbush Avenue at +14 feet NAVD88, and generally decreases
to +9.5 feet NAVD in the eastern portion of the site near Taxiway 6.
Portions of the project area are located within the 500-year
floodplain, as determined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA). The eastern portion of Hangar B parking lot and portions of the
North Forty are located within the 500-year floodplain, where the
elevation is below +9.5 feet NAVD88 and there is a 0.2% annual chance
of flooding.
Overall, the potential flood risks associated with the proposed
action include risks to human health and life, as well as minor
flooding damage risk to temporary housing and associated facilities.
Within the project area, flood potential is highest at Hangar B/Sea-
Plane Ramp Parking Lot because it is located within approximately 500
feet of Jamaica Bay and along the segment ofFlatbush Avenue located
within 100 feet of Dead Horse Bay. It should be noted that the proposed
temporary migrant housing will primarily be constructed on-top of
already built out (hardened) lands formerly constructed as airfield
runways. These park lands are situated outside of the 1% annual
exceedance probability (AEP) flood within Zone X that constitutes a
``moderate'' floodplain hazard in FEMA terms (floods that fall between
the 0.2 to 1% Annual Exceedance Probability). As such, the flooding
risk to government investment is considered acceptable. The risk of
inundation, erosion, wave attack, and overtopping potential at the
project area is low.
FBF has previously been used by the US Government for emergency
relief services stemming from Superstorm Sandy relief, which included
housing for 2,000 troops (US Army 2012). The existing infrastructure
and facilities needed to support emergency services can be found
nowhere else within NPS lands at this location.
NPS has prepared a Floodplain Statement of Findings (FSOF) to
document compliance with Executive Order 11998 (Floodplain Management),
as amended by Executive Order 13690. Through the FSOF process, the NPS
has determined that there are no practicable, non-floodplain locations
for the proposed action. Potential impacts to human life and health
would be mitigated through a combination of non-structural risk
mitigation measures. Emergency preparedness planning, storm and flood
warning, and coordinated evacuation plans and protocols would be
protective of human life. The risk to federal capital investment is
acceptable, and there is no risk to natural and beneficial floodplain
values because the cumulative amount of new permanent infrastructure
would be small, above ground, and in previously disturbed and developed
areas. All improvements, including storm or flood damage, would be
undertaken at the City's sole expense and only with the NPS's prior
written approval. Therefore, the NPS finds that the proposed action
would not have any additional adverse impacts on floodplains and their
associated values.
Native Vegetation
Natural areas at FBF are named as fundamental resources in the
park's 2014 GMP. Most of the areas between the runways and taxiways are
managed as natural areas and wildlife habitat.
FBF is a mostly man-made conglomerate of dredged fills, fly ash,
garbage, and other urban fill. Some of the North Forty (the western
portion) is also underlain with rubble or other urban materials.
Nonetheless, a wide diversity of vegetation grows here, including
successional maritime forest, northern beach heather dune shrubland,
northern bayberry dune shrubland, and a host of human-modified
associations such as early successional woodland, northeastern modified
successional forest, and northeastern old field. Both successional
maritime forest and northern bayberry dune shrubland are vulnerable or
imperiled statewide. Within GATE, maritime forest is considered
important at FBF because of its rarity at other park sites where it
occurs. Hardened areas of the FBF coastline associated with development
alternate with eroding mudflats or sandy beaches. Although the
grassland growing in the center of FBF is human-modified little
bluestem old field, it is important because it is one of the largest
remaining grasslands in the New York City area and provides nesting for
migratory birds as well as pollinator habitat.
The City selected FBF as suitable for temporary migrant housing in
part because of existing hardscaped acreage to accommodate the proposed
use. The proposed action would minimize new built facilities and would
concentrate them on existing hardscaped areas to avoid any rare
vegetation associations. The proposed action could increase park
visitation. During hours that the park is open, site contractors, staff
and migrants will have use of the park following the same rules as
other visitors. Bringing more visitors to FBF would increase the
potential for loss of vegetation from trampling, a localized adverse
impact. Mitigation measures include site use controls (e.g., temporary
fencing, as necessary) and improved signage that would encourage
visitor use in authorized areas and authorized trails to limit new
adverse impacts on native vegetation in natural areas such as the North
Forty and grasslands. The NPS would also limit migrant, City personnel,
and/or contractor access to some park areas as necessary to protect
native vegetation. Overall impacts to native vegetation would be
minimal, and impacted vegetation is expected to return to existing
conditions once use of the site for the emergency action ends.

Figure 5. 2008 Floyd Bennett Field National Historic District
existing conditions showing the location of woods, managed grasslands
and marsh (from Cultural Landscape Report for Floyd Bennett Field (Cody
and Auwaerter 2009)
Nonnative Plants
Large areas of FBF are dominated by nonnative, invasive species
such as porcelain berry (Ampelopsis glandulosa), Japanese honeysuckle
(Lonicerajaponica), tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima), oriental
bittersweet (Celastrus orbiculatus), mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) and
Phragmites australis (the nonnative genotype). Park management of
invasive species is conducted as time and resources allow. This
localized beneficial impact on native vegetation would continue during
the time frame of the proposed action. In addition, the proposed action
would provide for some removal of invasive species and planting of
appropriate native species (Figure 2 projects 2, 3 and 4). Efforts
associated with the proposed action to control invasive species and
revegetate with native species would have localized beneficial impacts.
Wildlife
Maintenance of the grassland at FBF through mechanical means
(primarily mowing) would continue during the time frame of the proposed
action, with localized benefits for grassland nesting birds, including
homed lark, eastern meadowlark, upland sandpiper, savannah sparrow,
northern harrier, American kestrel, and common barn owl. Many of these
species also depend on FBF grasslands for overwintering, as do short-
eared owls and rough-legged hawks. Historically, the Jamaica Bay and
Long Island region was thought to contain some of the largest
contiguous grassland habitats east of the Mississippi River (Drennan
1981, as cited in NYCDEP 2007). Although the 140-acre grassland at FBF
is artificially maintained by mowing, it is extremely rare as a
remaining large grassland habitat in the New York City area. Its unique
character and ability to support wildlife that would otherwise not be
present in the park in more than an incidental way provides substantial
benefits for grassland species.
The proposed action would construct temporary migrant housing on
existing hardscaped areas to avoid wildlife impacts. Increased
occupancy and 24-hour use of Leased areas adjacent to grassland and
forested habitat, in addition to increased visitator use of trails
within these habitats, has the potential for adverse localized impacts
on wildlife in the form of disturbance, which may cause wildlife to
temporarily avoid certain areas. Mitigation measures including site use
controls (e.g., temporary fencing) and improved signage would encourage
visitor use in authorized areas and authorized trails to limit new
adverse impacts on wildlife. NPS would also limit migrant, City
personnel, and/or contractor access to some areas ofFBF as necessary to
protect wildlife. Impacts to wildlife would be temporary and limited to
the duration of the proposed action. A qualified biologist would be
onsite to conduct an inspection of the work area for any exterior
construction occurring between April 1 and September 1. The biologist
would determine if there were nesting activity that could be impacted
by the project. If there is, construction activities would be modified
or relocated to the greatest extent possible to avoid or minimize
impacts. Overall, the proposed action would result in minimal,
temporary impacts to wildlife. Impacts would cease and conditions would
return to a state similar to existing conditions once use of the site
for the emergency action ends.
Special Status Species
The proposed action does not include in-water work or potential to
impact aquatic federal or state listed species that may occur within
Jamaica Bay. NPS is conducting informal consultation with US Fish and
Wildlife Service (USFWS) under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act
(ESA) on four terrestrial ESA listed species that may occur within the
proposed emergency action area.
Piping plover (Charadrius melodus--threatened) are not expected to
occur within the project area except as occasional transients. Plovers
may forage along the FBF shoreline of Jamaica Bay. There is no
designated critical habitat for piping plover. The only report in eBird
of a piping plover sighting at FBF was one bird in March 2016. The
nearest location for annual piping plover nesting is on the oceanside
beach on the Rockaway Peninsula at Fort Tilden near Beach 169th Street
. For these
reasons, NPS concludes that the proposed action would have no effect on
piping plover.
Roseate tern (Sterna dougallii dougallii--endangered) are not
expected to occur within the project area except as occasional
transients. The species may nest and forage on the Atlantic shoreline
of the Rockaway Peninsula and may forage on along the shorelines ofFBF
and bay beaches within Jamaica Bay. No roseate tern sightings at FBF
were identified in eBird. Nesting or loafing roseate terns have been
observed occasionally during the past decade on the beach at Breezy
Point, which is over 3 miles (4.8 km) from the project area. There is
no critical habitat designated for this species. For these reasons, NPS
concludes that the proposed action would have no effect on roseate
tern.
Red knots are not expected to occur within the project area except
as occasional transients, in part because suitable breeding habitat
does not occur within New York. This species breeds in the Canadian
arctic region. From mid-March through late November, foraging red knots
(Calidris canutus rufa--threatened) may occur along the FBF shoreline
of Jamaica Bay. The first eBird reported sighting of two red knots at
FBF occurred in August 2007. Since then, the greatest number of
individuals reported at one time was 71 individuals at an unnamed FBF
location in May 2017. The most recent eBird report was of a single
individual in late October 2022. The proposed emergency action is
located approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) from proposed critical habitat
unit NY-4 in Jamaica Bay (88 FR 22530). The proposed action has no
potential to temporarily or permanently alter the quality of critical
habitat in the project vicinity or the proposed critical habitat unit
NY-4. Most of the proposed project area is more than 984 feet (300 m)
from the Jamaica Bay shoreline. For these reasons, NPS concludes that
the proposed action would have no effect on red knot and that there
would be no effect on designated critical habitat for this species.
Northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis--endangered)
historically occurred in Kings County. No site-specific survey for bats
has been conducted at FBF. The proposed action does not include forest
conversion via trimming or removal of vegetation during the active
season (April 1 through October 30). The project area is not located
within 0.5-mile radius of any known northern long-eared bat
hibernacula. For these reasons, NPS concludes that the proposed action
would have no effect on the northern long-eared bat.
Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus--candidate) are known to feed
on the nectar of flowering plants such as those in the approximately
140-acre grasslands at FBF in the immediate vicinity of the proposed
action. There is no designated critical habitat for this species at
FBF. Management of the grasslands will continue as usual and no use or
alteration of the grassland area will be authorized as part of the
proposed action. Increased activity on and use of runways adjacent to
the FBF grasslands as well as increased park visitation related to the
proposed action would result in minimal, temporary impacts to monarch
butterfly. Impacts would cease and conditions would return to a state
similar to existing conditions once use of the site for the emergency
action ends. As a candidate species, ESA consultation is not
applicable.
State listed and other special status species that may occur in the
project action area include barn owl, red-banded hairstreak (butterfly;
historic), white-m hairstreak (butterfly; historic), forest blue grass,
red pigweed, reflexed flat sedge, and Schweinitz's flat sedge.
Increased activity on and use of runways adjacent to forested and
grassland habitats as well as increased park visitation related to the
proposed action would result in minimal, temporary impacts to these
species. Impacts would cease and conditions would return to a state
similar to existing conditions once use of the site for the emergency
action ends.
Soundscapes
A 2015 resource brief for GATE provides the best available summary
of the park's acoustic environment, using predictions from a geospatial
sound model (see Wood 2015). The mean existing sound level at GATE is
estimated to be 47.3 dBA (decibels), and the average existing sound
level (with the influence of human-caused sounds) is predicted to be
9.9 dBA above natural conditions. The soundscape at FBF has a sound
level typical of quiet rural residential areas with little to light
automobile traffic (45-50 dBA) and some helicopter overflights
associated with New York Police Department (87 dB at 500 ft and 79 dB
at 1000 ft) (see How Loud is a Helicopter? (Comparing Helicopter Noise
Levels/Executive Flyers).
Noise from temporary construction activities would originate from
mechanical equipment. To the extent practicable, construction work
would occur during park operating hours. However, some construction
related activities could occur outside of those hours. Generators used
would be Tier 4 in order to minimize impacts to soundscapes. Generators
would be located as far as possible from visitors, migrants, and
wildlife. The City will monitor noise levels associated with generator
operations to ensure that the noise levels identified in the GATE
Superintendent's Compendium of 60 decibels, at 50 feet from the source,
are not exceeded. Overall, construction noise impacts would be minimal
and temporary.
Visitor Use and Experience
The human need for recreation and renewal has resulted in an
evolving history of traditional and innovative uses of the park's lands
and waters to improve the quality of urban life. Intrinsically
connected to the diverse population of the New York metropolitan area,
GATE's resources provide unique opportunities for outdoor recreation
and rejuvenation in a densely populated and largely impacted
metropolitan area. The park's open spaces and wide horizons offer
opportunities for resource-based recreation as well as contemplation
and reflection. The feelings associated with open space in the high-
density metropolitan area and opportunities to recreate through nature
observation, water-based activities, walking, hiking, biking, and
visiting historic sites are fundamental resources and values.
The GATE 2014 GMP identifies FBF as a year-round destination for
daily use and multiple day experiences that include outdoor recreation,
community activities, environmental education, preservation and
interpretation of the aviation and military history of this historic
site, and the protection of grassland, forested and coastal ecosystems.
FBF is managed to provide camping opportunities, a community garden,
environmental education, access to shorelines and waters of Jamaica Bay
for fishing, canoeing, and kayaking, an extensive system of trails for
hiking, access to runways and roadways for biking, and the concession
operated Aviator Sports Complex. Park management relies heavily upon
partnerships to provide and develop recreational opportunities and for
the management and reactivation of the structures and spaces at this
site.
With annual visitation around 9 million, GATE typically ranks
within the top five most visited National Park units. FBF, like many of
the sites in GATE, is in the ``backyard'' of New York City. Going to
FBF is routine for many park visitors. A 2015 visitor use survey
identified that 22% of visitors surveyed had visited FBF 21 or more
times in the prior 12 months, 50% had visited 2-20 times and 28% had
visited only once. Visitor use levels peak in the summer months,
decrease in the fall, and are lowest in the winter and spring. In the
Jamaica Bay Unit of GATE, 73% of visitors were white, 12% black or
African American, and 10% were Asian.
The closure of any areas within FBF would be minimized to only
those areas necessary for the proposed action and for the safety and
security of park visitors. Certain portions ofFBF will be closed to the
public by the City for operation and administrative purposes in
connection with the proposed action. Access to those areas of the park
will be limited to the City, its contractors, migrant residents and
others that have been approved by the NPS. Visitors will continue to
have access to locations within FBF that provide opportunities for
fishing, launching and landing kayaks, biking, walking, running, or
parking a car to enjoy views of Jamaica Bay. At FBF, there are five
primary hubs of visitor activity. The Hangar B parking lot is one of
those hubs. The Hangar B parking lot is the only area: ofFBF that
provides vehicle access to the shoreline and views of Jamaica Bay.
Temporary impacts on visitor use of the Hangar B parking lot would
occur due to a partial closure of the lot as a result of the proposed
action. The NPS does not anticipate that any impacts related to the
proposed action will disproportionately affect any particular user
groups.
FBF has over 3 miles (5 km) of shoreline. Much of the shoreline is
hardened or currently unavailable for visitor use due to access
limitations related to adjacent upland forested habitat, land
assignments to park partners (New York City Sanitation, New York City
Police Department) or the shoreline is part of the US Marine Corps
Reserve Center, an inholding within FBF. Public access is focused at
approximately 2962 feet (903 m) of shoreline across 5 locations within
FBF. The proposed action would restrict access to less than 900 feet
(250 m) of shoreline (Figure 1 area C). The primary effect of this
limited access would be on visitors that rely upon vehicle access to
the shoreline. The impacted area is the only area in FBF in which park
visitors can drive up to the shoreline. This is a popular area for
fishing, landing and launching of kayaks, and for enjoyment of the
Jamaica Bay viewshed.
FBF provides approximately 5.8 miles (9.3 km) of runways, taxiways
and roads for biking or running. Vehicle traffic is authorized on 4.3
miles (6.8 km) of that 5.8 miles (9.3 km). There are no protected bike
or pedestrian use lanes on any roadways. The proposed action would
restrict pedestrian and bicycle access of up to 1.5 mile (2.5 km) on
Runways 6 and 19 (Figure 1 areas A and B). There would be no impact to
vehicle access since both areas are closed to vehicles.
There is system of trails within the North Forty area ofFBF,
northwest of Runway 6. Depending upon the season, the Belt Parkway is
visible from some parts of the trail system. It is not anticipated that
trails will b closed. Increased noise and activity associated with
construction and operation of the temporary migrant camp as well as
increased use of trails would impact visitor experience on some parts
of the trail system.
Three varieties of camping experiences are offered at Floyd Bennett
Field and include programmatic camping at Ecology Village, walk-in tent
camping at Goldenrod and Tamarack Campground (30 sites), and
recreational vehicle (RV) camping at an RV park (12 sites). The
Goldenrod and Tamarack Campground and RV camp sites have not been open
since 2019. These sites were closed in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID. The
sites were not opened in 2022 and 2023 due to staff capacity. No bids
were received in response to a 2022 Request for Proposal for use and
occupancy to facilitate opening the campground to the public. The
Ecology Village camping program is managed by the Appalachian Mountain
Club for school and youth groups. The proposed emergency action is not
expected to impact programmatic camping at Ecology Village.
The proposed action would increase park visitation. During hours
that the park is open, the City's contractors, staff and residents will
have use of the park following the same rules as other visitors. NPS
would limit migrant, City personnel, and/or contractor access to some
park areas and/or amenities as necessary to provide visitor safety.
Overall, the proposed action would have minimal and temporary impacts
on visitor use and experience, primarily in the form of increased use
of specific sites within FBF during operating hours.
Traffic and Site Circulation
Floyd Bennett Field is located south of Exit 11 on the Belt Parkway
(Shore Parkway), a six-lane highway that runs west to northeast across
the southern portion of Brooklyn, NY. Commercial traffic is not
authorized on NY Parkways. As a major route of transportation in the
metropolitan area, traffic is heavy on the Belt Parkway. The 2016 two-
way annual average daily traffic (AADT) for Shore Parkway, starting at
Rockaway Parkway (Exit 13) traveling southwest toward Flatbush Avenue
(Exit 11), was 165,379 vehicles. Flatbush Avenue travels in a northwest
to southeast along the western boundary of FBF. The AADT count for
Flatbush Avenue, from Shore Parkway to the Marine Parkway Bridge, was
24,420 vehicles. Although less common, access is also available from
the south via Beach Channel Drive, Rockaway Point Boulevard, and the
Marine Parkway Bridge, which had 2016 AADT counts of22,616, 6,753, and
21,100, respectively. The average travel time for people commuting in
New York City is 36.2 minutes while the average commuter in Kings
County drives approximately 42.6 minutes (NYSDOT 2016, USCB 2019).
Impacts to area traffic will be mitigated through the City's
transportation management plan and mobilization and demobilization
plans. Impact to area traffic will be minor and temporary.
Flatbush Avenue is part of the Jamaica Bay Greenway, a 19-mile
pedestrian and bicycle loop around Jamaica Bay in Brooklyn and Queens.
A protected bicycle lane with access points is located along the
eastern side ofFlatbush Avenue. NPS allows pedestrians and cyclists to
hike and bike the historic runways at FBF (NYCDOT 2019).
According to traffic data, approximately 1,600 vehicles on weekdays
and 1,000 vehicles on weekend days access FBF via Aviation Road during
non-summer months and up to 3,000 vehicles per day during the summer
months, which is a rate of approximately 300 vehicles per hour during
typical daytime recreation hours. Peak hour traffic using Aviation
Drive is 150 vehicles (morning) to 200 vehicles per hour (evening).
Saturday midday peak hour traffic is slightly more than 200 vehicles
per day (NPS 2014).
Impacts on traffic and site circulation are expected to be minimal
and temporary. Runways 6 and 19 are currently closed to vehicles;
therefore, use of those areas under the proposed action would not
impact vehicle circulation. While there is no prohibition on pedestrian
or cyclist use of runways, taxiways, and roadways within FBF, there are
very limited sidewalks and no bike lanes or designated multi-use paths
within FBF. As a result, movement throughout FBF is primarily by
vehicle. Site circulation would be improved through the rehabilitation
and reopening of the historic airport entrance to FBF and repairs to
approximately 12,000 linear feet of main access routes within FBF
(Figure 2 projects 1 and 5).
Coordination with Affected Agencies and Public Outreach
The NPS has coordinated with the State ofNew York and New York City
officials regarding this emergency action. Throughout the duration of
the proposed action, in coordination and collaboration with the NPS,
the City will be primarily responsible for all external communications
to include questions from media, local residents, businesses, other
land users, and local, state, and federal elected officials. The NPS
will make this memorandum available to the public.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800.12(b)(2), the NPS has notified the
New York State Historic Preservation and Tribal Historic Preservation
Offices of the Delaware Nation, Delaware Tribe, Stockbridge-Munsee
Community, Shinnecock Nation and Shawnee Tribe, and the Advisory
Council on Historic Preservation of the emergency situation and will
initiate consultations as appropriate.
The NPS has prepared a FSOF to document compliance with NPS
floodplain management procedures for the proposed action. Through the
FSOF process the NPS has determined that there are no practicable, non-
floodplain locations for the proposed action. Potential impacts to
human life, health, and safety would be mitigated through a combination
of non-structural risk mitigation measures. Emergency preparedness
planning, storm and flood warning, and coordinated evacuation plans and
protocols would protect human life, health, and safety. There is no
risk to federal capital investment or natural and beneficial floodplain
values. All improvements shall be undertaken at the City's sole expense
and only with the NPS's prior written approval. Therefore, the NPS
finds that the proposed action would not have any additional adverse
impacts on floodplains and their associated values.
The NPS has determined the proposed action would have no effect on
listed species and is conducting informal consultation with the USFWS
under Section 7 of the ESA on four terrestrial ESA listed species that
may occur within the proposed emergency action area.
The NPS has determined that the proposed emergency action
constitutes an exigent circumstance under the Coastal Zone Management
Act as provided in 15 CFR 930.32(b). Once the exigent circumstances
have passed, the NPS shall comply with all applicable provisions of 15
CFR part 930, subpart C, to ensure that the activity is consistent to
the maximum extent practicable with the enforceable policies of the New
York State Department of State Coastal Management Program. The NPS will
submit a Consistency Determination to provide a description of actions
and supporting policy analysis.
Follow-on Actions
The NPS will conduct some follow-on actions related to site
improvements that may not occur until the end of, or after the up to
12-month emergency action period. The follow-on actions will include:
Public Campground Improvements--The FBF public campground sites
(Goldenrod and Tamarack Campgrounds; Figure 2 project 2), which are
across the street from Historic Hangar B, would be used for
administrative purposes such as providing a location for office
trailers and equipment staging. Minor improvements, such as vegetation
maintenance (mowing and trimming) necessary for use to support the
emergency action are included in the above analysis. Additional
improvements would be required as follow-on actions under the Lease.
Consistent with the park's 2014 GMP, camping opportunities would be
improved at FBF. The City would be responsible for campground
improvements so that the facilities follow current NPS Campground
Design Guidelines. The existing 30 public camping sites would be
upgraded and an additional 30 sites will be added. Improvements include
adding signage, removing hazardous and invasive trees and vegetation,
installing fire rings and picnic tables at each site, re-grading the
access trail, and building a new permanent restroom facility. Temporary
trailers would be required to house additional restroom and shower
facilities as well as a camp store.
Outdoor Education Campus--The City would be required to develop
portions of an outdoor education campus according to existing
conceptual designs. This includes garden plots, an outdoor skills
course, a gathering pavilion, and parking lot. Actions to accomplish
this would include site clearance of invasive plant material,
construction of permeable walking trails, rehabilitation of the
existing greenhouse, installation of new parking, and visitor
amenities. This would need to proceed in coordination with the two park
partners involved in this project, Launch and the Jamaica Bay-Rockaway
Parks Conservancy.
In general, these actions will be consistent with the park's
holistic management approach for coastal resources to improve
resiliency and will incorporate principles of energy conservation and
sustainability, resulting in long-term beneficial impacts to park
resources and values, and to visitor use and experience. Adverse
impacts related to the follow-on projects may include short-term,
localized, and low intensity impacts to air quality, soundscapes,
vegetation, wildlife, and visitor use and experience related to
construction activities and temporary closures. The NPS will complete
site-specific NEPA compliance, as appropriate, before taking the
following actions. Therefore, these actions are not fully covered by
these NEPA alternative arrangements.
Other Alternatives Considered but Dismissed
Hangars 3 and 4--Hangars 3 and 4 (49,020 square feet) at Floyd
Bennett Field are existing vacant historic structures that were
constructed in 1931. Hangars 3 and 4 are contributing resources in the
Floyd Bennett Field Historic District which was listed on the National
Register of Historic Places. They have not been restored or
rehabilitated and are currently vacant and deteriorated. The building
shell is showing signs of failure that left uncorrected will result in
damage that is beyond reasonable repair. The interior is aged, and the
utilities and systems are either inoperable, inadequate, or non-
compliant with current codes and standards. The building is only
suitable as semi-protected storage space in its current condition, and
even that use is put at risk by continued neglect. Although the NPS is
currently preparing plans to rehabilitate the structures, no work has
yet begun.
Within the Jamaica Bay Unit, there are no other sites where
emergency activities of a similar nature have previously been sited;
have a lower potential for impact on park resources, operations, or
public uses; or have available hardscaped areas of sufficient acreage
with a low risk of flood potential to accommodate the emergency
activities.

Why the World Has Gone Cuckoo for Copper
The U.S. and China are competing to acquire the metal essential for EVs
and data centers. It is also at the center of a $43 billion takeover
battle.
Wall Street Journal, May 14, 2024 by Julie Steinberg
https://www.wsj.com/business/why-the-world-has-gone-cuckoo-for-copper-
ef8c385a
*****
After one of the world's top copper producers recently hit a financial
crunch, the Biden administration started huddling with potential
investors about taking a stake in the company's Zambian mines worth as
much as $3 billion.
The search isn't restricted to American companies, with entities from
the United Arab Emirates, Japan and Saudi Arabia--all viewed as
friendly to U.S. interests--expressing interest in the stake in First
Quantum Minerals' FM 7.53% assets, according to people familiar with
the matter.
The goal is simple: to keep it out of Chinese control and prevent the
Asian superpower from tightening its grip over the global supply of
crucial metals and minerals.
The bidding, expected to be concluded later this year, is part of a
global rush to acquire more copper, a key component in everything from
electric cars to transmission lines and the data centers powering the
AI revolution.
BHP Group's record nearly $43 billion takeover bid for Anglo American,
which was rejected Monday, puts a fresh spotlight on the intense demand
for copper. While London-listed Anglo produces a range of commodities,
from diamonds to nickel, Australia's BHP has made clear that it most
prizes the company's copper assets. Anglo rebuffed BHP's first offer
last month, and other companies are believed to be weighing rival bids.
On Tuesday, Anglo announced its own turnaround plan, saying it would
get out of its platinum, diamond and steelmaking coal businesses--
effectively pitching investors on a strategy that makes copper even
more central to the company's future.
Chief Executive Duncan Wanblad said on a media call that the company
would look at growing its copper business both organically and from
potential mergers and acquisitions, such as taking greater stakes in
assets it already owns.
``Copper of course is the story of the day,'' he said.
While the U.S. government doesn't have any oversight over a proposed
deal, officials have communicated to Anglo executives that they are
concerned consolidation could limit the overall supply of copper, said
people familiar with the matter. The U.S. is also concerned that China
could put pressure on BHP to sell some assets or agree to sell more of
its copper to the country to address potential anticompetitive
concerns.
For the U.S., the current frenzy highlights the importance of its
yearslong effort to build up supplies of the metals and minerals
critical to the green-energy transition.
Demand for copper is expected to rise as certain mines close or scale
back production. Copper futures are up 20% this year.
The U.S. doesn't have a ministry for mining, a sovereign wealth-fund or
much of a domestic mining industry. That has put it at a disadvantage
with China, which can direct its state-owned enterprises to invest
heavily no matter how commodity prices are performing.
The U.S. government is limited in how much money it can directly pump
into projects of national security. That means it must work with
private companies at home and abroad, as well as friendly countries
with sovereign-wealth funds, to entice them to invest in assets helpful
to national interests.
The Wall Street Journal reported last year, for example, that the U.S.
and Saudi Arabia have held talks for potential agreements in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, under which Saudi Arabia would take
stakes in mines and U.S. companies would be guaranteed some of the
rights to production.
One of President Biden's senior advisers, Amos Hochstein, is a linchpin
of this effort. Hochstein and a small team at the State Department have
been flying around the world, meeting with government officials in sub-
Saharan Africa one day and with U.S. investors the next.
Regarding copper, ``We don't have a lot of new supply coming online
around the world,'' Hochstein said in an interview. ``What concerns me
is even when a discovery is made, it could take between seven and 15
years before the first copper comes out.''
The U.S. has committed more than $1 billion to the Lobito Corridor to
develop local infrastructure, including clean power and a railroad
connecting Angola, Congo and Zambia to export critical minerals. Also
in Zambia, the U.S. last year urged the U.A.E. to consider investing in
Mopani Copper Mines, according to people familiar with the matter.
The effort was successful: Zambia in December chose the U.A.E.'s
International Resources Holding as a new equity partner.
Hochstein declined to comment on specific deals.
Hochstein said he and his team have made clear to African governments
that the U.S. is trying to put forward an alternative model that won't
result in debt, corruption and environmental degradation.
``We are putting our money where our mouth is,'' he said.
A central part of the U.S. effort is the International Development
Finance Corp., a federal agency that helps finance projects overseas.
The agency agreed to invest $740 million last year in the mining
sector, up from $245 million it had committed to legacy mining
projects.
It is currently in talks to finance a multibillion-dollar copper mine
in Pakistan that, when it comes online in 2028, will be among the
world's largest copper projects, according to people familiar with the
matter.
An Irish company called TechMet is one of its signature investments.
Under the Trump and Biden administrations, the agency has given TechMet
some $105 million in funding and become its second-largest shareholder.
An investment firm backed by a scion of the Walton family also invested
in the most recent fundraising round, which valued the company at more
than $1 billion.
``We are in a second Cold War,'' said TechMet CEO Brian Menell, a South
African. ``One has to increasingly pick sides. For me it's never been a
moment's doubt. It is a competition between Western values and
dictatorship.''
TechMet owns stakes in lithium, cobalt, nickel, vanadium and rare-earth
miners.
Meanwhile, Chinese miners, with government backing, are rapidly
snapping up assets. In Belt and Road countries, which don't include
Brazil or Australia, China spent more than $19 billion last year on
metals and mining investments, up 158% from 2022, according to the
Green Finance & Development Center at Fudan University in Shanghai.
That is the highest level since 2013.
In the latest example, a Chinese firm is in advanced talks to buy
Chemaf, a metals producer that is developing a cobalt and copper mine
in Congo, according to people familiar with the matter.
At least two Western suitors were interested in buying the company,
according to people familiar with the matter, including Chilean Cobalt
Corp., or C3, a U.S. company with copper-cobalt operations in northern
Chile.
Duncan Blount, chief executive of C3, said he spoke with the
International Development Finance Corp and State Department about
making a bid, but concluded it would have been too expensive. Still, he
said, ``They were incredibly helpful on this venture and other
projects. They're keen to see American businesses and entrepreneurs go
back into Congo.''
