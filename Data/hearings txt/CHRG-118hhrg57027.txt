----------
WEDNESDAY, JUNE 12, 2024
House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime
Transportation,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10:17 a.m., in
room 2167 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Daniel Webster
(Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. Webster of Florida. The Subcommittee on Coast Guard and
Maritime Transportation will come to order.
I ask unanimous consent that the chair be authorized to
declare a recess at any time during today's hearing.
Without objection, show that ordered.
I ask unanimous consent that Members not on this
subcommittee be permitted to sit with the subcommittee on
today's hearing and ask questions.
Without objection, show that ordered.
As a reminder, if Members wish to insert a document into
the record, please also email it to DocumentsTI@mail.house.gov.
I now recognize myself for the purpose of an opening
statement for 5 minutes.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL WEBSTER OF FLORIDA, CHAIRMAN,
SUBCOMMITTEE ON COAST GUARD AND MARITIME TRANSPORTATION
Mr. Webster of Florida. Today, our subcommittee will
receive testimony from the Coast Guard's efforts to
recapitalize its surface, air, IT, and shoreside assets.
I would like to welcome the witnesses: Vice Admiral Paul
Thomas, Deputy Commandant for Mission Support, and Shelby
Oakley, Director of Contracting and National Security
Acquisitions at the United States Government Accountability
Office.
Vice Admiral Thomas, I understand this is the last time you
will be at this hearing, which may be a great joy to you. And
so, we are thankful for you, glad you did what you did during
your nearly 40-year career. And we really appreciate it. On
behalf of the subcommittee, I would like to thank you for your
service to the Nation. In the spirit of today's hearing, we all
wish you fair winds and following seas as you embark on this
new chapter.
But, before we let you go, sail off into the sunset, we are
here today to discuss the Coast Guard's slow, multidecade
recapitalization program campaign. The Service can count
significant successes, including the near completion of its
National Security Cutter and Fast Response Cutter programs,
though we hope to squeeze in a few more Fast Response Cutters.
The Coast Guard has made substantial investments into the
shoreside facilities necessary to homeport these new assets.
Unfortunately, challenges remain. Despite clearly
articulated needs, the administration's yearly budget requests
consistently fall short of the resources needed to carry out
the Service's own recapitalization plans. Now, the Coast Guard
is left with the lowest appropriation for its procurement
account in a decade and is facing a Grand Canyon-sized hole in
its future-year budgets.
This subcommittee has repeatedly warned the Coast Guard
that it is approaching a fiscal cliff. Now it has arrived. The
Offshore Patrol Cutter moves from one to two hulls per year,
starting in fiscal year 2026, and the substantial need will
grow even more, as soon as fiscal year 2026, to keep the Polar
Security Cutter program moving forward. The current budget
request cannot sustain the Service's program of record without
a significant increase. In contrast to meager appropriations
and budget requests, this committee has consistently authorized
levels to provide at least a bare minimum needed to keep the
Service from losing even more ground.
The Commandant appeared before our subcommittee 3 weeks
ago, and while she was unable to commit to a timeline or cost
for the Polar Security Cutter, the subcommittee commended her
for recognizing the Service requires at least $3 billion in
procurement funding to move its programs forward. While I don't
expect you to commit to a Polar Security Cutter timeline, I do
look forward to learning what progress is being made on the
Coast Guard's major acquisition programs, including the Polar
Security Cutter, Offshore Patrol Cutter, and Waterways Commerce
Cutter.
Aside from surface assets, the Coast Guard's aging aviation
fleet requires modernization. As the Service phases out the C-
27 platform and replaces its no-longer-manufactured MH-65s with
more capable MH-60s, funding needs only grow. I remain
concerned with the plan to reduce the total number of
helicopter assets, as well as the suitability for the larger
MH-60 platform for specialized Coast Guard missions and cutter
operations. I assure you that the committee will continue to
track these transitions very closely.
Finally, the Coast Guard's IT and shoreside infrastructure
are in dire need of repair and modernization. The Coast Guard
Authorization Act of 2024 provides $1.1 billion in fiscal years
2025 and 2026 to modernize the Coast Guard's shoreside
infrastructure, including substantial investments at the Coast
Guard Academy and the Coast Guard's sole enlisted accession
point at Cape May, both of which are literally crumbling.
To our witnesses, thank you for participating today.
Vice Admiral Thomas, as this is your last hearing before us
before you retire, I encourage you to provide us with your
full, unvarnished view of how we ought to right the ship.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Daniel Webster of Florida, Chairman,
Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation
Today our subcommittee will receive testimony on the Coast Guard's
efforts to recapitalize its surface, air, I.T. and shoreside assets.
I'd like to welcome our witnesses--Vice Admiral Paul Thomas, Deputy
Commandant for Mission Support, and Shelby Oakley, Director of
Contracting and National Security at the United States Government
Accountability Office.
Vice Admiral Thomas, I understand you will be retiring at the end
of this month after a nearly 40-year career in the Coast Guard. On
behalf of the Subcommittee, I would like to thank you for your service
to our nation. In the spirit of today's hearing, we all wish you fair
winds and following seas as you embark on your next chapter.
But before we let you sail off into the sunset, we are here today
to discuss the Coast Guard's slow multi-decade recapitalization
campaign. The Service can count significant successes, including the
near completion of its National Security Cutter and Fast Response
Cutter programs--though we still hope to squeeze in a few more Fast
Response Cutters. The Coast Guard has also made substantial investments
in the shoreside facilities necessary to homeport these new assets.
Unfortunately, challenges remain. Despite clearly articulated

To our witnesses--thank you for participating today. Vice Admiral
Thomas--as this is your last hearing before you retire, I encourage you
to provide us with your full unvarnished view on how we can right the
ship.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Now, I will recognize--actually
recognize the----
Mr. Larsen of Washington . Recognized, sir?
Mr. Webster of Florida. Well, I think so.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. OK.
Mr. Webster of Florida. So, Representative Larsen, you are
recognized.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING
MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thanks. I thank the chair.
I want to start by recognizing Admiral Thomas' service and
his retirement, as well, later this month. Congratulations and
thank you for your service.
I also want to recognize Lieutenant Iia Carter who is
moving from the Office of Leg Affairs, or whatever you-all call
the Coast Guard and will be the CO at Station L.A. So, then you
will just have to deal with Carbajal directly instead of all of
us.
So, today's hearing is an opportunity for this committee to
receive an update on the Coast Guard's now 17-year-old
recapitalization plan. Included in this plan and subsequent
update in 2017 is the acquisition of National Security Cutters,
Fast Response Cutters, Offshore Patrol Cutters, Polar Security
Cutters, Waterways Commerce Cutters, and the HC-130J.
Many of these acquisition programs have experienced
significant delays and budgetary issues.
For instance, the Coast Guard awarded the contract for the
design and construction of three Polar Security Cutters in
2019. And, now 5 years later, the shipyard that won that
contract has been sold, the design is only 60 percent complete,
and the Coast Guard has not determined the delivery date or
final cost for these vessels.
The Coast Guard awarded the contract for 25 Offshore Patrol
Cutters in 2016, and the program is currently behind schedule
and over budget. Four cutters are currently under construction,
and the Service has amended the contract to move production to
another shipyard after these four are delivered.
The contract to build 27 Waterways Commerce Cutters was
awarded in 2022 but has been delayed due to a Small Business
Administration determination. Further, the contractor has
recently purchased a new shipyard to complete construction.
These three acquisition programs are the largest currently
underway in the Coast Guard, utilizing nearly all the
procurement, construction, and improvements account. And they
have a few things in common. They are all over budget, delayed,
and construction will not be completed in the shipyard that was
awarded the initial contract.
Additionally, while the delivery of HC-130J aircraft has
been well-received by Coast Guard aviators--providing better
range, speed, and technology than its predecessor--the program
is stalled at 19 airframes due to a lack of funding. This,
coupled with the unplanned retirement of the C-27 fleet,
creates a large gap in Coast Guard aviation capabilities.
While it is appropriate to scrutinize the Coast Guard's
decisions, we in Congress must consider our own actions and the
structural impediments facing the Service. The Service is
dealing with inadequate resources and an inadequate industrial
base.
U.S. shipyards are having a hard time competing in the
global marketplace. This is not because our yards and workers
are any less capable, but because foreign shipyards receive
large direct subsidies. For instance, between 2010 and 2018,
the Chinese Government provided $132 billion to its shipping
and shipbuilding industry.
While I support the Small Shipyard Grant Program, the Title
XI Shipbuilding Program, and the Capital Construction Program,
collectively these programs pale in comparison to the support
other nations provide to their shipbuilding industries.
Government shipbuilding becomes much more costly without a
robust domestic commercial shipbuilding industry.
I am pleased that Secretary Del Toro of the Navy has
directed the Navy to lead the newly formed Government
Shipbuilders Council. Working with the Coast Guard, the
Maritime Administration, and NOAA, the council seeks to bolster
the commercial shipbuilding industry.
Congress must strengthen U.S. shipyards, the merchant
marine, and the Jones Act to ensure commercial business for
U.S. shipyards.
While I am confident the Coast Guard will complete the
ongoing recapitalization effort, I am concerned that Congress
and the administration are not prepared to provide the
appropriate level of resources.
Before this subcommittee 3 weeks ago, the Commandant
testified that the Coast Guard PC&I account would need to be
funded in excess of $3 billion annually in order to adequately
cover each acquisition program. Unfortunately, that number does
not include the shoreside infrastructure needs, such as piers,
hangars, and repair facilities, to support those new assets.
Finally, we can't forget about the women and men who will
be operating the new cutters and aircraft once they are
delivered. The growing shoreside infrastructure backlog has
real-world consequences for the women and men of the Coast
Guard.
I have visited numerous Coast Guard stations across the
country and have seen firsthand the unacceptable living
conditions. No servicemember should be asked to live with mold
or asbestos. They deserve better. Congress needs to do better.
As Congress funds the construction of assets, we need to
ensure that servicemembers get the shoreside support that they
deserve. This includes workstations, housing, healthcare, and
childcare.
With that, I want to thank the chair and the ranking member
for holding this hearing and look forward to the testimony
ahead.
Thank you. I yield back.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Rick Larsen of Washington, Ranking Member,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
I'd like to start by recognizing Admiral Thomas' service and
retirement later this month. Congratulations and thank you for your
service.
I also want to recognize Lieutenant Iia Carter, who is moving from
the Office of Legislative Affairs and will be the Chief Officer at the
Station Los Angeles. Then you'll just have to deal with Carbajal

Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you.
I now recognize Representative Carbajal.
Ranking Member, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL OF CALIFORNIA,
RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON COAST GUARD AND MARITIME
TRANSPORTATION
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
And congratulations, Iia Carter, on your upcoming post in
the State of California, what many call paradise. We only
accept the best of the best. So, you are going to fit right in.
Congratulations.
And, to Admiral Thomas, thank you for your service to our
Nation. I wish you the best in your upcoming retirement and
really appreciate all the contributions you have made to the
Coast Guard over the years. So, congratulations on your
upcoming retirement, as well.
Before we get started into the substance of today's
hearing, I am compelled to express my disappointment again with
the newest account of the Coast Guard's handling of Operation
Fouled Anchor. The latest disturbing revelations by the former
sexual assault and response coordinator at the Coast Guard
Academy details a disturbing and blatant disregard for victims
in an effort to protect the reputation of the Coast Guard.
If the Coast Guard wants to mend its reputation, it must
commit to real transparency and real accountability, which
includes the senior leadership. The Coast Guard is a great
organization, but those who have dedicated their lives to
service deserve better.
The Coast Guard is in the midst of recapitalizing cutters,
boats, airplanes, helicopters, shoreside infrastructure, and
information technology. In recent years, in almost every case,
the procurements have been over budget and over schedule.
While it is important to recapitalize and modernize Coast
Guard assets, we must address the ongoing production issues to
ensure timely and cost-effective delivery.
The Government Accountability Office, or GAO, has reported
several times that the acquisition of new Coast Guard assets
routinely comes in delayed and over budget. This is a
concerning trend, particularly for a small and underresourced
Service that is forced to rely on aging and obsolete assets to
conduct its missions.
Improving the acquisition program requires investment so
the Coast Guard can bolster its oversight and create internal
capabilities. It also requires investing in U.S. shipbuilding
to ensure we have shipyards capable of building the assets we
need.
U.S. shipyards depend on contracts from the Navy and Coast
Guard to support their business. The Coast Guard is oftentimes
outbid by the size and value of Navy contracts. Recently, this
has forced the Coast Guard to rely on the lack--or should I
say, on shipyards that lack experience with Government
contracts.
We cannot rely on the Coast Guard to be the subsidizer for
the ship industry. Time is of the essence to bring on new
cutters, shoreside infrastructure, and IT systems. Not only do
modern assets mean improved mission readiness, but they also
mean better quality for life for our Coasties.
Servicemembers want their families to live in the best
quality housing and want to work in buildings that are not
falling down around them. That starts with investing more in
shoreside infrastructure and eliminating the estimated $3
billion backlog.
Ultimately, servicemembers deserve to live and work in
places that are not on the brink of failure. Congress and Coast
Guard leadership owe it to the personnel to deliver this. I
have visited countless Coast Guard stations where buildings are
either damaged, outdated, or completely unusable.
I have said it before, and I will say it again: We must
fund the Coast Guard at the levels significantly higher than
requested and appropriated in recent years. I welcome the
Commandant's push to be a $20 billion agency by 2030, including
a need to more than double the procurement, construction, and
improvements account, otherwise known as PC&I.
Even GAO has recognized that the funding typically
requested by the Coast Guard underestimates their need for
recapitalization by more than $800 million each year. All signs
point to the need to fund the Coast Guard at higher levels.
I was heartened to see the House appropriations mark
included a $500 million above-the-budget request for the PC&I
account. That is a step in the right direction, but future PC&I
funding must match or exceed $3 billion per year, as reflected
in the Coast Guard Authorization Act and the Commandant's
recent statements.
I hope this hearing continues to shed light on the growing
resource gap, and this serves as a wakeup call.
With that, I yield back with 1 second to spare.

TESTIMONY OF VICE ADMIRAL PAUL F. THOMAS, DEPUTY COMMANDANT FOR
MISSION SUPPORT, U.S. COAST GUARD; AND SHELBY S. OAKLEY,
DIRECTOR, CONTRACTING AND NATIONAL SECURITY ACQUISITIONS, U.S.
GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE
TESTIMONY OF VICE ADMIRAL PAUL F. THOMAS, DEPUTY COMMANDANT FOR
MISSION SUPPORT, U.S. COAST GUARD
Admiral Thomas. Well, good afternoon, Chairman Webster and
distinguished members of the subcommittee.
My testimony, I believe, has been entered into the record.
Thank you for this opportunity to update you on the Coast
Guard's ongoing activities to recapitalize the Service's assets
and capabilities and continue to meet the increasing mission
demands across the Nation and around the world.
On behalf of the Commandant and the entire Coast Guard
workforce, I express my sincere appreciation for your oversight
and for your support of our Service.
In response to ever-increasing demand for the Coast Guard's
unique capability, we anticipate a need over the next two
decades to field new, more capable assets and expand our
enduring presence in critical areas like the Arctic and the
Indo-Pacific without reducing our domestic capabilities. We
must also build new C5I infrastructure and grow our workforce
to operate and maintain these assets.
To do this, the Coast Guard must continue investing in a
multibillion-dollar acquisition portfolio to meet mission needs
of today and tomorrow. The Commandant requested that I
reiterate the Service's sincere thanks for this committee's
support of her efforts to become the Coast Guard the Nation
needs with an authorization of $3.4 billion in PC&I funding. We
greatly appreciate your support.
This subcommittee has been a great advocate for the Polar
Security Cutter, one of our Service's top two acquisition
priorities. The PSC acquisition continues to move forward, and
I am optimistic that the design will mature to the degree the
Service can authorize start of construction later this year.
The Service's other top acquisition priority is the
Offshore Patrol Cutter, and the OPC celebrated a milestone last
year with the launch of OPC 1 Coast Guard Cutter Argus. There
is still much work to be done before Argus is delivered, but we
are eager to deploy these new cutters to replace the aging
Medium Endurance fleet.
In addition to those major cutters, our oldest cutters are
our inland tenders, some of which were built during World War
II and all of which need to be recapitalized. The Waterways
Commerce Cutter will replace those ships, and we recently
ordered long lead-time material for the initial WCC.
The Service is also keenly focused on continued investment
in our aviation fleet to meet the mission demands of today and
tomorrow. The expansion of the MH-60T fleet is critical as the
MH-65 approaches end-of-service life.
The HC-130J is the Coast Guard's largest and most capable
aircraft, and the Service recently took the delivery of our
17th HC-130J. Number 18 and 19 are still in the acquisition
process, and we need your support to complete our existing
program of record of 22 aircraft.
As the subcommittee is well aware, the Coast Guard has
significant needs across our shore infrastructure portfolio. We
are focused on conducting the planning necessary to make well-
informed requests in future years to address concerns across
the Service, including at our critical accession points: the
Training Center Cape May and the Coast Guard Academy.
The Service remains committed to building the fleet of the
future and delivering systems capability that will maximize
return on investment. To advance the Service's recapitalization
efforts and properly plan to meet mission requirements, we must
have stable, predictable funding. Our Commandant has stated our
Coast Guard must be a $20 billion organization by 2033. And, in
line with your recent $3.4 billion PC&I authorization, we need
at least $3 billion annually in recapitalization dollars.
However, we are constrained by fiscal limits, and increasing
operating and sustainment costs restrict our ability to invest
in recapitalization.
As the Commandant has said, most of our recent funding
increases have gone to running the Service of today, not to
building the Service for tomorrow.
The Coast Guard recognizes your efforts to change that
paradigm, and we look forward to working with you to ensure the
Service continues to field the capabilities and the personnel
necessary to meet our Nation's demands.
Congressman Carbajal mentioned yesterday's hearing and the
recent revelations by our former sexual assault response
coordinator at the Coast Guard Academy.
Congressman, I just wanted to take this opportunity to
speak directly to the victims who may be out there or folks who
may know victims out there, because the most concerning part of
that report was the potential that some victims have not been
able to access healthcare that they need through the VA. And we
have and we continue to stand ready to assist any victims'
access to healthcare efforts. And I personally am ready to do
that, but we also have an enterprise victim advocate that can
help any victims out there.
So, thank you for your support. I appreciate the
opportunity to testify, and I look forward to your questions.

Prepared Statement of Vice Admiral Paul F. Thomas, Deputy Commandant
for Mission Support, U.S. Coast Guard
Introduction
Good morning, Chairman Webster, Ranking Member Carbajal, and
distinguished members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for your continued
oversight and strong support of the Coast Guard. I am honored to appear
before you today to update you on our ongoing efforts to recapitalize
our aging surface and aviation fleets; Command, Control,
Communications, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and
Reconnaissance (C5ISR) systems; and shore infrastructure.
Our Commandant speaks regularly about the need to adapt to the
ever-increasing pace of change. To keep up with the changing world
around us, we must provide our total workforce with modern assets,
systems, and infrastructure to support mission execution. In line with
this direction, the Service needs continued Congressional support to
invest in a multibillion-dollar portfolio of acquisition programs that
will deliver the right capabilities for the Service. At the same time,
the Coast Guard continues to prioritize investments in shore
infrastructure, where every mission begins and ends: the facilities,
piers, runways, and buildings that are as necessary for operations as
our ships, boats, aircraft, and C5ISR systems.
Indeed, the Service's largest recapitalization effort since World
War II remains a top priority for the Commandant. Today's efforts to
invest in tomorrow's needs will shape the Coast Guard and impact
national security for decades. This Subcommittee's continued support
has helped us make tremendous progress, and it is critical that we
continue to deliver assets to the field that improve mission execution
and provide the capabilities the Nation needs. Simply put, we must act
today to be prepared for tomorrow.
The Coast Guard Acquisition Enterprise
As the Chief Mission Support Officer of the Coast Guard, I lead a
talented team of professionals dedicated to building and maintaining a
modern force of assets, infrastructure, and systems that meet the needs
of the Service. Acquisitions require executable strategies that
consider the need to plan and scope acquisitions before work begins; to
oversee the design and production processes; and to prepare future
crews and the maintenance community for the delivery and future
operation of new capabilities.
To bolster acquisition oversight, the Coast Guard has developed an
acquisition governance structure, continues to refine that structure,
strengthen processes, institutionalize the roles of our technical
authorities, and focus on recruiting and retaining a highly capable
acquisition workforce. We continue to implement initiatives to minimize
risks and maximize affordability within our complex acquisition
programs. We leverage the experience and expertise of our partners to
perform key functions and guide Coast Guard decision-makers throughout
the acquisition life cycle.
Status of Key Acquisition Efforts
The Coast Guard continues to make progress in our efforts to
recapitalize the fleet and support systems. The Service is taking
delivery of new cutters, aviation assets, boats, C5ISR capabilities,
and upgraded shore infrastructure, and investing in critical mission-
enabling service life extensions, major maintenance, and key upgrades
of the legacy surface and aviation fleet to enhance mission readiness
and performance.
Surface Programs:
With the strong support of this Subcommittee, we are moving forward
with the acquisition of the Nation's first new heavy polar icebreakers
in over four decades. The United States is an Arctic nation, and we
have both sovereign rights and responsibilities to safeguard our
interests in the Arctic. Similarly, the United States has strong
interests in the Antarctic region. Coast Guard polar icebreakers are
the foundation of U.S. operational presence and influence in the polar
regions. These multi-mission cutters provide assured, year-round access
not only for Coast Guard missions, but also in support of critical
activities that protect key U.S. interests in the high latitudes.
Along with the Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC), the Polar Security
Cutter (PSC) is the Coast Guard's top acquisition priority. When fully
operational, the three PSCs the nation requires will provide the global
reach and icebreaking capability necessary to project U.S. presence and
influence, conduct Coast Guard missions in the high latitudes, and
advance our national interests in the Arctic and Antarctic regions.
The Coast Guard and Navy have established an Integrated Program
Office (IPO) to leverage each service's experience and expertise in
large, complex vessel acquisition programs. Both services remain
committed to attaining the necessary design maturity prior to beginning
production activities. This approach ensures shipyard readiness and
mitigates overall schedule risk. Detail design activities are ongoing,
and long lead-time material for the lead ship have been delivered to
the shipyard. The IPO has adopted an innovative and incremental
approach to support early production, Prototype Fabrication Assessment
(PFA), which is based on Navy best practices. By prioritizing and
starting construction on up to eight low-risk modules, PFA allows the
shipbuilder to progressively build workforce capability, test new
processes and equipment, and reduce production risk. To date, four
modules have been authorized for construction. These modules have
achieved near 100 percent design maturity and present very low risk of
re-work. These modules, unlike work done under special studies
previously authorized, will be part of the first PSC.
Earlier this year and in accordance with statutory and policy
requirements, the Coast Guard notified Congress that the PSC program
would exceed cost and schedule thresholds. The program is in the
process of reviewing cost and schedule projections provided by the PSC
prime contractor to formally establish new cost and schedule parameters
in the acquisition program baseline. This work is occurring in parallel
with ongoing program activities to support delivery of the PSC fleet as
quickly as possible.
The OPC also remains a top acquisition priority for the Service and
is vital to recapitalizing the capability provided by our legacy fleet
of 210-foot and 270-foot Medium Endurance Cutters (MEC). The program is
progressing, with production of OPCs 1-4 underway with the Stage 1
contractor. The lead OPC, Argus, was launched and christened October
27, 2023, and production activities continue with delivery of OPC 1
scheduled in Fiscal Year (FY) 2025. Additionally, the Service is
continuing with design activities on the Stage 2 contract, which will
lead to the future production of up to 11 additional OPCs.
As a bridging strategy to maintain mission capabilities until the
OPCs are delivered, the Coast Guard has begun 270-foot MEC service life
extension program (SLEP) activities that address key systems and
component obsolescence on board the MECs, the first of which just
exceeded 40 years in service. Two SLEP prototypes have been completed
to date, including CGC Harriet Lane, which recently returned to the
operational fleet, was designated as the Indo-Pacific Support Cutter
and is currently providing additional mission capability in that
critical region. The first full 270-foot MEC SLEP is currently underway
at the Coast Guard Yard.
In 2022, the Coast Guard awarded a contract for the design and
future production of the river buoy tender and inland construction
tender variants of the Waterways Commerce Cutter (WCC) fleet. The
contract includes options for production of up to 27 cutters, and a
separate effort is planned to deliver three inland buoy tenders to
achieve a total fleet of 30 WCCs. The program recently established the
required cost, schedule, and performance parameters to allow the
Service to proceed with the initial purchases of long lead-time
material to support construction of the first two WCC variants.
Investment in our inland fleet is critical to the continued
operation of the Marine Transportation System, which facilitates more
than $5.4 trillion in annual economic activity. The legacy fleet is
approaching obsolescence, maintenance costs are rising, and the vast
majority of these cutters do not support mixed-gender berthing.
Continued progress toward delivering these new assets and replacing the
legacy fleet, which has an average age of over 55 years, is critical to
maintaining the Coast Guard's capability to execute this important
mission.
The Service continues to deliver National Security Cutters (NSC)
and Fast Response Cutters (FRC) to the fleet, providing game changing
capabilities to operational commanders and supporting expanded mission
demands around the globe. The Coast Guard commissioned the tenth NSC,
CGC Calhoun, into service this April and has commissioned 55 FRCs into
service. Last month, with the support of the Administration and
Congress, the FRC program used an available contract option to order
two additional FRCs (hulls 66-67) to further the Indo-Pacific Strategy
of the United States. The FRCs have demonstrated unmatched capacity to
support engagement with partners throughout the Indo-Pacific, and the
President's FY 2025 budget request includes additional investments to
increase meaningful presence in the region. These investments are
absolutely essential to support the rules-based international system,
enhance partner capabilities, deter malign actors, and combat the
illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing that threatens economies
throughout the Indo-Pacific.
The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2024
provides funding for the acquisition of a commercially available polar
icebreaker (CAPI). The Service has completed market research and, in
large part due to Congressional support to streamline the acquisition
process, the Coast Guard is moving forward with an acquisition strategy
to procure and begin initial modifications of a CAPI for future service
in the Arctic on an accelerated timeline.
In concert with our efforts to acquire new assets, the Service is
also focused on sustaining and improving our existing fleet through the
In-Service Vessel Sustainment (ISVS) program. The Service is
approaching the completion of Major Maintenance Availability activities
for the 225-foot seagoing buoy tenders at the Coast Guard Yard in
Curtis Bay, Maryland; the last cutter is scheduled to leave the Coast
Guard Yard in FY 2025. Planning is underway in advance of future ISVS
efforts to conduct a major maintenance availability on the 175-foot
Coastal Buoy Tender fleet and the CGC Healy SLEP.
CGC Healy is the Service's medium polar icebreaker and will begin
its SLEP in the near future. That SLEP will be modeled after the phased
approach the Service used for our only heavy polar icebreaker, CGC
Polar Star. Like CGC Polar Star's SLEP, CGC Healy's SLEP will include
five phased availabilities around CGC Healy's annual operations.
The Coast Guard is also making investments across the boat fleet,
producing the next generation of cutter boats to enhance interdiction
capabilities of parent cutters. Additionally, the Coast Guard continues
to perform SLEP activities to extend the useful service life of the
Service's 47-foot motor lifeboats by replacing obsolete, unsupportable,
or maintenance-intensive equipment, and standardizing configuration
across the fleet.
Aviation Programs:
The Coast Guard has formally established a program baseline to
govern SLEP activities on the existing MH-60T fleet and to continue the
transition of the rotary-wing fleets to a single airframe through new
fleet growth increments. These efforts will be accomplished using a
combination of converted low-time U.S. Navy helicopters and newly
manufactured hull components. When combined with structural fitting and
dynamic component replacements through the SLEP, the new hulls will
extend the service life of the Coast Guard's vertical lift capability
into the 2040s. Service life extension work also continues on the H-65
fleet, including critical avionics upgrades.
Acquisition of new HC-130J airframes is significantly enhancing the
Coast Guard's capabilities to conduct airborne surveillance, detection,
classification, and identification of vessels and other aircraft
missions in coordination with the surface fleet and shoreside
facilities. Later this year, we plan to take delivery of the 18th and
final HC-144B following the completion of Minotaur missionization and
Ocean Sentry Refresh activities. In light of the clear signal from
Congress in FY 2024's appropriation, the Service is transitioning away
from the HC-27J--we have ceased missionization activities and will
retire the remaining un-missionized HC-27J aircraft over the next
several years. In the near future the Coast Guard will be providing a
brief on the way ahead for our medium range fixed wing capability,
including consideration for unmanned systems.
The Coast Guard is delivering standardized missionization packages,
based on the U.S. Navy's Minotaur Mission System Suite, that improve
system performance, address obsolescence concerns, improve cyber
security of the mission system, and increase compatibility with
Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security assets and
systems.
Additionally, the Coast Guard continues to leverage the use of
unmanned aircraft system (UAS) capabilities to support the surveillance
and maritime domain awareness capabilities of the NSC fleet. Nine
operational NSCs have been equipped with UAS infrastructure and
equipment and routinely deploy with UAS capabilities as part of the
cutter's total force package that dramatically enhances their ability
to gain maritime domain awareness and interdict smugglers.
C5ISR and Information Technology Programs:
The Coast Guard continues to acquire C5ISR and information
technology (IT) systems that enhance the mission capabilities of new
and recapitalized Coast Guard assets to operate in challenging
environments. The systems provide standardized capability to major
cutters and aircraft, enabling assets to receive, evaluate and act upon
information, and facilitate interoperability and information sharing
inside and outside the Coast Guard. IT efforts like the Cyber and
Enterprise Mission Platform program address the need to replace and
modernize obsolete support systems to improve mission readiness and
operational effectiveness.
Shore Infrastructure:
As Coast Guard leadership have repeatedly noted in testimony before
this Subcommittee, shore facility maintenance and recapitalization are
critical to mission success. New, more capable assets must be paired
with investments in our infrastructure needs. The Coast Guard is
committed to taking a leading-edge approach to project planning to
ensure the Service is able to effectively execute and deliver the
modern and resilient infrastructure required to meet the operational
demands of today and tomorrow.
Conclusion
Since 1790, the Coast Guard has safeguarded our Nation's maritime
interests and natural resources on our rivers, in our ports, on the
high seas, and around the world. Each day, the Coast Guard carries out
its missions to protect lives, protect the environment, secure our
maritime borders, facilitate commerce, and defend our national
security. Our mission support and acquisition enterprises are,
likewise, working each day to plan and deliver the assets and
capabilities needed to support these critical missions.
The cutters, boats, aircraft, C5ISR systems, and shoreside
infrastructure we acquire today will provide vital capability for
decades to come. We are committed to maximizing the Nation's return on
these important investments. Thank you for the opportunity to testify
before you today and for all you do for the women and men of the U.S.
Coast Guard. I look forward to answering your questions.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you for your testimony.
Now we turn to Ms. Oakley.
You are recognized for 5 minutes.
TESTIMONY OF SHELBY S. OAKLEY, DIRECTOR, CONTRACTING AND
NATIONAL SECURITY ACQUISITIONS, U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY
OFFICE
Ms. Oakley. Good morning, Chairman Webster, Ranking Member
Carbajal, and members of the subcommittee.
Thank you for the opportunity to talk about challenges with
Coast Guard's acquisition portfolio affordability.
My testimony today should not be a shock to anyone. The
Coast Guard's acquisition portfolio is unaffordable, given
historic and predicted budgetary levels. We have been
consistently reporting this for over 10 years.
The Commandant recently testified that, while the Coast
Guard's budget request included nearly $1.6 billion to
recapitalize assets, in fact, up to $4 billion is what is
actually required.
While the Coast Guard has the lion's share of
responsibility for the budget predicament they are in, others
play an important role, too. This includes OMB and DHS, as well
as congressional decisionmakers.
As a result, my statement today will focus on two main
areas. First, I will cover the actions the Coast Guard can take
to improve the portfolio's affordability. Second, I will raise
key questions that decisionmakers need to address if they want
to begin tackling these challenges.
From where I sit, I see two main areas the Coast Guard
needs to improve. First, Coast Guard needs to do better when it
comes to managing cost growth and schedule delays on its major
acquisition programs. This includes the high-priority PSC and
OPC programs.
These programs are now collectively costing $13 million
more than initially planned and are 4 to 5 years behind
schedule. These outcomes make affordability challenges worse.
They extend the need for resources and prolong the wait for new
and necessary capabilities.
Second, Coast Guard needs to better articulate the full
scope of its funding needs and identify tradeoffs that will be
necessary when and if those needs cannot be met. The Coast
Guard and DHS have consistently kicked the can down the road
and have not taken steps to realistically lay out a plan for
meeting its mission needs outside of the constrained budget
process.
Ten years ago, we recommended that the Coast Guard develop
a 20-year fleet modernization plan that identifies all assets
necessary to meet its missions and the funding needed for those
assets. Similarly, in 2019, we recommended the Coast Guard
include supporting details about tradeoff decisions and
congressional budget requests and related reports. Coast Guard
has yet to address these recommendations in part because of
limitations imposed by OMB and DHS.
I want to be clear. I am not suggesting that the Coast
Guard operate in its planning without constraints. That is
necessary. What I am suggesting is that, without the Coast
Guard identifying what it needs to fund the ships, aircraft,
and infrastructure it needs to meet its missions now and in the
future, decisionmakers are left with limited insight. This
precludes them from making tough decisions to prioritize and
fund programs essential to the Coast Guard's missions or to
advocate for additional resources.
Speaking of decisionmakers, that brings me to my next
point. Coast Guard does not make budget requests in a vacuum.
It must align with the President's topline budget numbers,
which are set by OMB and DHS. Congressional decisionmakers have
tried to help by consistently funding programs on the Coast
Guard's unfunded priorities list. The Coast Guard has come to
rely on this as a way to get more resources, and this can take
decisions about priorities out of the Coast Guard's hands.
Decisionmakers will have to eventually address difficult
decisions about the affordability of the Coast Guard's
portfolio.
First, what can the Coast Guard do to improve management of
its acquisition programs and achieve better cost and schedule
outcomes?
Second, when will the Coast Guard develop a long-term plan
that can inform tradeoff decisions?
Third, which programs may need to be cut, reduced, or
deferred?
Finally, what gaps or reductions in mission capability will
operators and the public face due to these challenges?
We have 16 open recommendations to the Coast Guard that
could help answer some of these questions, and the Coast Guard
should prioritize implementing them.
For example, holding programs accountable to stabilizing
ship designs before proceeding with construction is in line
with leading practices and will result in better cost and
schedule outcomes. That is a decision that is facing the PSC
program in the near future.
Again, none of these questions are new, but they are even
more critical today as the Coast Guard's budget will be
increasingly consumed by programs like OPC and PSC in the
coming years.
Chairman Webster, Ranking Member Carbajal, and members of
this subcommittee, this completes my oral statement. I am happy
to answer any questions that you have.

Prepared Statement of Shelby S. Oakley, Director, Contracting and
National Security Acquisitions, U.S. Government Accountability Office
Coast Guard Acquisition: Actions Needed to Address Affordability
Challenges
Highlights
Why GAO Did This Study
The U.S. Coast Guard employs a variety of vessels and aircraft,
several of which are approaching the end of their intended service
lives. Consequently, the Coast Guard plans to invest billions of
dollars to acquire several high priority assets. These include three
Polar Security Cutters, 25 Offshore Patrol Cutters, and 79 additional
MH-60T helicopters.
This statement addresses (1) challenges with the affordability of
the Coast Guard's portfolio of major acquisitions, and (2) key
questions that the Coast Guard and Congressional decision-makers will
need to address because of these challenges. The statement also
highlights GAO's prior recommendations and matters for Congress which,
if implemented, would help address the challenges. This statement is
largely based on GAO's prior work on Coast Guard acquisitions issued
from 2012 through 2024, including GAO-18-454, GAO-23-105805 and GAO-23-
105949. Information about the scope and methodology of prior work on
which this statement is based can be found in those products.
What GAO Recommends
Since 2012, GAO has made 48 recommendations (16 of which remain
open) on how to better manage the Coast Guard's major acquisition
programs. GAO will continue to monitor the agency's progress in
addressing these recommendations. GAO has also made matters for
congressional consideration to improve Coast Guard acquisitions. Two of
these matters remain open.
What GAO Found
The Coast Guard plans to spend over $40 billion to modernize its
vessels and aircraft. But it faces persistent challenges managing its
major acquisition programs--generally those with life-cycle cost
estimates of at least $300 million. These challenges include:
Cost growth. Coast Guard's planned investments for its portfolio of
major acquisitions increased by $8.2 billion since 2018. The increase
is primarily related to cost increases on the Offshore Patrol Cutter
program and additional investments in MH-60T helicopters. This problem
increases the cost pressure on the overall portfolio.
Lack of long-term planning. The Coast Guard makes short-term budget
decisions that obscure the trade-offs needed to balance the long-term
affordability of the portfolio. In 2014, GAO recommended that the Coast
Guard develop a long-term plan to manage its highest priority efforts.
The agency agreed and statute directed the Coast Guard to develop such
a plan. But the Coast Guard, as of June 2024, has yet to produce one.
Affordability. The Coast Guard's short-term budget decisions have
resulted in a buildup--or bow wave--of near-term unfunded acquisitions.
These decisions could negatively affect future acquisition efforts and
operations.
Program uncertainties. Further, the Coast Guard faces
uncertainties--such as unrealistic schedules and cost estimates--on two
of Coast Guard's highest priority programs: the Offshore Patrol Cutter
and Polar Security Cutter. These uncertainties will likely exacerbate
portfolio affordability challenges.
GAO has made several recommendations and matters for Congressional
consideration that, if implemented, would inform key questions for
decision-makers, such as:
How can Coast Guard manage its acquisition programs to
achieve better cost and schedule outcomes?
Which programs will decision-makers cut, reduce, or defer
to balance the affordability of the Coast Guard portfolio?
__________
Chairman Webster, Ranking Member Carbajal, and Members of the
Subcommittee:
I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Coast Guard's
management of its acquisition portfolio, including key challenges with
the affordability of this portfolio. The affordability of the Coast
Guard's portfolio has consequences affecting its ability to accomplish
its vitally important missions. These include search and rescue; ports,
waterways and coastal security; migrant interdiction; drug
interdiction; aids to navigation; and ice operations. Having the right
assets to accomplish these missions relies, in part, on being able to
afford them within expected budgets, and, if necessary, make hard
decisions about what to prioritize. However, the Coast Guard continues
to rely on the annual budget process and its 5-year Capital Investment
Plan for long-term acquisition planning, processes which we found have
contributed to affordability problems.
My statement today will address (1) challenges with the
affordability of the Coast Guard's portfolio of major acquisitions, and
(2) key questions that decision-makers will need to address because of
these challenges. I will also highlight areas where our prior
recommendations, if implemented, would help the Coast Guard address
these challenges. This statement is based on our extensive body of work
examining the Coast Guard's acquisition efforts spanning more than a
decade.\1\

For the reports cited in this statement, among other methodologies,
we analyzed Department of Homeland Security acquisition management
policy and Coast Guard guidance, data, and documentation. We
interviewed Coast Guard officials at its headquarters and selected
field units to determine the total cost of the Coast Guard's
acquisition portfolio and how the Coast Guard manages its acquisition
portfolio. Further detailed information on our scope and methodology
can be found in the reports cited in this statement. For this
statement, we obtained some updated information from the Coast Guard on
program costs and funding.
We conducted the work on which this statement is based in
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our

evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and
conclusions based on our audit objectives.
Cost Growth, Short-Term Planning, and Uncertainty about High Priority
Programs Exacerbate Affordability Challenges of the Coast Guard's
Portfolio
Major Acquisition Portfolio Increased $8.2 Billion from 2018 to 2024
From 2018 to 2024, the Coast Guard's planned investments for its
portfolio of major acquisition programs increased from $32.3 billion to
at least $40.5 billion, or by 25.5 percent.\2\ This represents an $8.2
billion increase over the 6-year period. For some of these programs,
however, the Coast Guard is developing or updating its cost baselines,
which may reveal additional estimated costs. Additionally, the Coast
Guard currently estimates that it will need about $18 billion to
complete development and acquire the assets. See table 1 for details on
the increased estimated cost and remaining investment required of each
major acquisition program.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ The Department of Homeland Security generally defines major
acquisition programs as those with life-cycle cost estimates of at
least $300 million.

Legend: n/a = not applicable.
\a\ Total estimated acquisition cost is the threshold cost from the acquisition program baseline, which
establishes a program's costs, schedule, and performance parameters. The acquisition program baseline is the
agreement between the acquisition program, component, and department-level officials that establishes how
systems being acquired will perform, when they will be delivered, and what they will cost. In accordance with
DHS policy, the acquisition program baseline for a program establishes objective (target) and threshold
(maximum acceptable costs, latest acceptable milestones, and minimum or maximum acceptable performance)
parameters for a program.
\b\ As provided by the Coast Guard's 5-year Capital Investment Plan, dated fiscal year 2022, estimated
completion dates can reflect the completion of different activities depending on the program and are based on
funding levels in the 5-year plan.
\c\ The 2024 acquisition program baseline cost estimate does not include costs associated with personnel and
shore infrastructure for the Fast Response Cutter. The prior estimate in 2018 includes these costs. The Coast
Guard estimates that personnel costs are $184.8 million and shore infrastructure costs are $267.2 million in
base year 2008 dollars.
\d\ The Fast Response Cutter program of record was increased in 2020 by six and again in 2022 by one, for a
total of seven additional cutters beyond the program of record. The program was subsequently rebaselined to
account for this change in quantities. In 2024, the Coast Guard received $220 million for two additional Fast
Response Cutters. According to the Coast Guard, the Fast Response Cutter program is rebaselining to address
the recent increase to the program of record.
\e\ The Coast Guard has yet to develop an acquisition program baseline that covers the entire duration of the
program. It plans to have the updated acquisition program baseline for the Offshore Patrol Cutter program
approved in late fiscal year 2024.
\f\ An updated acquisition program baseline that will include an updated cost estimate is expected in the first
quarter of fiscal year 2025. In April 2024, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the cost of the three
Polar Security Cutters to be $5.1 billion.
\g\ This reflects the cost estimate in the preliminary acquisition program baseline for the Waterways Commerce
Cutter program. As of May 2024, the initial acquisition program baseline had yet to be approved.
\h\ Date applies to the completion of the HC-27J program. The acquisition effort for the HC-144B aircraft is
close to completion, with full operational capability expected in 2024.
\i\ The 2018 total estimated acquisition cost included funding for the HC-130H program. This program was
canceled in the 2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act and the acquisition program baseline was updated in March
2020 to reflect this change. The 2024 total estimated acquisition cost is only for the HC-130J acquisition.
\j\ MH-60T includes three increments. Increments 1 and 2 both have a current acquisition program baseline with a
current cost estimate. Increment 3 has a preliminary acquisition program baseline with a preliminary cost
estimate.
The $8.2 billion increase is primarily related to cost increases on
the Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC) program and the addition of the medium
range recovery helicopter or MH-60T to the portfolio, which we discuss
in greater detail below. This problem increases the cost pressure on
the overall portfolio.
Lack of Long-Term Planning Hinders the Coast Guard's Ability to Make
Necessary Trade-offs
For over 10 years, we have repeatedly found two main challenges in
how decision-makers, including the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Coast Guard,
budget for the Coast Guard's portfolio of acquisitions (1) the expected
cost of the Coast Guard's portfolio does not align with its plans and
funding levels; and (2) OMB, DHS, and the Coast Guard have made short-
term budget decisions that obscure the trade-offs needed to balance the
long-term affordability of the portfolio.\3\ For example:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ GAO-12-918; GAO-14-450; and GAO-18-454.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In 2012, we found that the Coast Guard's approach of
relying on the annual budget process to manage portfolio affordability
did not provide the best basis for making decisions to develop a more
balanced and affordable portfolio in the long-term.\4\ To help provide
decision-makers with current information to determine budgets, we
recommended that the Coast Guard conduct a comprehensive portfolio
review to develop revised baselines that reflect acquisition priorities
as well as realistic funding scenarios. DHS agreed with the
recommendation. However, as part of our recommendation follow-up
procedures, we found that the Coast Guard's efforts to implement the
recommendation did not include significant trade-off decisions needed
to improve the affordability of the portfolio. We eventually closed the
recommendation as not implemented. However, we continue to believe that
a comprehensive portfolio review that reflects acquisition priorities
as well as realistic funding scenarios would aid the Coast Guard in
managing the affordability of its portfolio.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ GAO-12-918.
In 2014, we found that the Coast Guard's annual budget-
driven trade-off approach created constant churn as program baselines
had to continually realign with budget realities instead of budgets
being formulated to support program baselines.\5\ This resulted in
trade-off decisions between capability and cost being pushed into the
future. At the time, OMB, DHS, and the Coast Guard took steps to
address the affordability challenges of Coast Guard's acquisition
portfolio. For example, OMB conducted annual performance and mission-
based reviews of the Coast Guard's acquisition portfolio as part of the
annual budget process. OMB officials told us at the time that they made
little progress in identifying the trade-offs that would make the
portfolio more affordable, such as adjusting the quantities or
capabilities of assets needed to meet mission needs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ GAO-14-450.
To help the Coast Guard improve the long-term outlook of its
portfolio, in 2014, we recommended that the Coast Guard develop a 20-
year fleet modernization plan that identified all acquisitions needed
to maintain its current level of service and the fiscal resources
necessary to build the identified assets. The Coast Guard agreed with
the recommendation. Subsequently, in 2016, the Coast Guard
Authorization Act of 2015 directed the Coast Guard to complete a 20-
year Long-term Major Acquisitions Plan, to be submitted to
congressional committees as part of a report on the status of the Coast
Guard's major acquisition programs.\6\ In November 2017, Coast Guard
officials told us they were developing a 20-year long-term plan that
specifically focused on their highest priority recapitalization and
sustainment efforts to meet the intent of the 2016 congressional
mandate.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\6\ Pursuant to 14 U.S.C. Sec. 5103(a), the broader status report
on the Coast Guard's major acquisition programs is to be submitted to
the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the
Senate and the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
every 2 years. See the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2015, Pub. L.
No. 114-120, Sec. 204(e) (2016) (codified at 14 U.S.C. Sec. 5103(e),
formerly numbered Sec. 2903, adding the long-term major acquisitions
plan). In addition, the Commandant of the Coast Guard is to submit the
long-term major acquisitions plan to the House Committee on Homeland
Security. Pub. L. No. 114-120, Sec. 101(f).
In June 2021, however, as part of our recommendation follow-up
procedures, Coast Guard officials told us they did not yet have an
approved 20-year plan. According to officials, the plan must be
approved by relevant agencies, including OMB and DHS. In 2021, we
closed the recommendation as not implemented, since we had no evidence
that this plan was imminent. As of June 2024, the Coast Guard has yet
to submit a 20-year plan to Congress. We continue to believe that a 20-
year plan identifying all acquisitions needed to maintain the current
level of service and the fiscal resources needed to build the
identified assets would help decision-makers take informed steps to
improve the long-term outlook of the Coast Guard's portfolio of major
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
acquisitions.
In 2018, we found the Coast Guard continued to manage its
acquisitions through its annual budget process and a statutorily
mandated 5-year Capital Investment Plan.\7\ Coast Guard officials said
the Capital Investment Plan reflected the highest priorities of the
department and that trade-off decisions were made as part of the annual
budget process. However, the effects of those decisions, such as which
acquisitions would take on more risk so others could be prioritized and
adequately funded, were not communicated in the Capital Investment Plan
to key decision-makers. This was because including such information was
not statutorily required.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ GAO-18-454. See 14 U.S.C. Sec. 5102 (formerly numbered Sec.
2902). Since 2012, the Coast Guard has been required to submit its
Capital Investment Plan with the President's budget in any given year.
The Capital Investment Plan is approved by DHS and the Office of
Management and Budget and, as we have reported in the past, is subject
to significant change each year.
We recommended, in 2018, that the Coast Guard include in the
Capital Investment Plan a discussion of how it prioritizes acquisition
programs and describe how its trade-off decisions could affect other
acquisition programs. This would provide decision-makers with the
information needed to see how annual trade-offs were affecting other
current and future programs. DHS agreed with this recommendation and
the Coast Guard included limited trade-off information in its Capital
Investment Plan, starting with the fiscal year 2021-2025 document. We
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
closed the recommendation as implemented.
More recently, in April 2023, in response to congressional
direction, the Coast Guard completed a fleet mix analysis of its
cutters.\8\ The analysis determined the number and types of cutters the
Coast Guard needs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8\ 168 Cong. Rec. H1709, H2404 (Mar. 9, 2022) (explanatory
statement accompanying the Department of Homeland Security
Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. No.117-103, div. F); 168 Cong. Rec.
S8553, S8564 (explanatory statement accompanying the Department of
Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. No. 117-328, div.
F. (2022)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
These include enforcement and security cutters, seagoing and
coastal aids to navigation cutters, inland aids to navigation cutters,
polar icebreaking cutters, and domestic ice operations cutters. The
Coast Guard noted that the analysis was not constrained by any
projected budgetary levels. As such, the fleet mix results did not
mirror the Coast Guard's current program of record, which is reflected
in the Capital Investment Plan. For example, the study showed that the
Coast Guard's desired fleet level includes more cutters than the Coast
Guard is currently planning to acquire. The extent that this analysis
will be incorporated into annual budget requests for the Coast Guard is
unclear.
Further obfuscating the outlook of the Coast Guard's portfolio
affordability is that amounts received for certain programs in recent
years has exceeded what the President's annual budget request requested
for the Coast Guard. This has included funding for HC-130Js, three
additional National Security Cutters not included in the original
program of record, and additional new airframes for the MH-60T
helicopters. These additional funds have allowed the Coast Guard to
purchase or field assets sooner than planned. However, this process
also contributes to the Coast Guard's affordability problem as it
allows the Coast Guard, DHS, and OMB to avoid making tough trade-off
decisions that would otherwise be necessary to include these items in
the President's annual budget requests.
Additionally, as required by statute, the Coast Guard submits an
annual Unfunded Priorities List after its budget is submitted.\9\ The
list includes program or mission requirements that were not selected
for funding in the proposed budget but that are deemed necessary to
address operational needs. For instance, the Coast Guard has included
post-delivery activities for the 11th National Security Cutter in the
last three Unfunded Priorities Lists. These activities are essential
for each cutter to reach full operational capability, yet the
President's annual budget request did not include funding for them. The
Coast Guard's five most recent Unfunded Priorities Lists have averaged
$1.1 billion in procurement, construction, and improvement activities,
which adds 75 percent to the Coast Guard's already stated needs in the
annual President's budget submission.

Coast Guard Faces Bow Wave of Unaffordable Acquisitions in Both the
Near-Term and Long-Term
For over 10 years, we have reported that the Coast Guard's short-
term term budget decisions have resulted in a buildup--or bow wave--of
near-term unaffordable acquisitions. This bow wave of funding needs
negatively affects future acquisitions efforts and potentially affects
future operations.\10\ This bow wave consists of new acquisition
programs and recapitalization efforts, as well as maintenance projects,
which continue to put pressure on available resources. Further, the
Coast Guard has been asked to conduct additional missions in recent
years, placing greater strain on operational assets. For example, the
planned Arctic Security Cutters will fulfill a mission that the Coast
Guard is not currently executing due to a lack of available assets.
Figure 1 provides aggregate projected funding for various major Coast
Guard acquisitions from fiscal years 2023 through 2027 Capital
Investment Plan, along with average budget requests and funding

Investment Plan for FYs 2023 through 2027
Note: The ``other'' category depicted in the graphic contains funding
projections for the National Security Cutter and Fast Response Cutter,
among other programs.
As reflected in the figure, the Coast Guard's projected needs from
fiscal years 2023 through 2027 exceed the average amount requested from
fiscal years 2020 through 2024. Also, the Coast Guard's average funding
received exceeded the average budget request for the Coast Guard by
$300 million over the last 5 years. Further, the Commandant of the
Coast Guard recently stated, during a Congressional hearing in May
2024, that the agency will need up to $3 billion in annual funding to
support its planned acquisitions.
The cost growth and uncertainties on two of the Coast Guard's
highest priority programs--Polar Security Cutter (PSC) and Offshore
Patrol Cutter (OPC)--are not fully reflected in the figure above and
will likely exacerbate the affordability concerns of Coast Guard's
portfolio.
PSC. In November 2023, the PSC program declared a cost
breach.\11\ The program determined it required additional funding in
excess of its $3.1 billion cost threshold, based on updated cost data.
The program plans to submit its updated life-cycle cost estimate to DHS
for approval by September 2024. The program also plans to submit its
revised acquisition program baseline to DHS by the end of 2024.\12\
While the cost estimate is not complete, the program's remediation plan
indicated that updated costs exceeded 20 percent of the previous
baseline threshold of $3.1 billion, or at least $600 million.
Additionally, as noted above, in April 2024, the Congressional Budget
Office estimated the cost of the PSC program to be about $5.1 billion,
or 63 percent more than what is reflected in the program's cost
baseline. This gap raises further questions about the affordability of
this program in a constrained budget environment.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\11\ According to DHS policy, a program that has not met or will
not meet any of its cost, schedule, or performance thresholds approved
in its acquisition program baseline will be considered in breach
status. In other instances, if an acquisition program cannot meet an
approved cost, schedule, or performance parameter due to a change in
scope, resulting from circumstances beyond the program's control, it
may be approved for an administrative update as an alternative to being
considered in breach status.
\12\ According to DHS policy, programs in breach status are
required to develop a remediation plan that outlines a time frame for
the program to either return to its parameters, rebaseline (i.e.,
establish new cost, schedule, or performance parameters), or have a
DHS-led program review that results in recommendations for a revised
baseline.
OPC. In June 2023, we found that, since the OPC program's
inception in 2012, the program had experienced cost growth of over 40
percent.\13\ The program attributed its cost increase to several
factors, including damage caused by Hurricane Michael in 2018;
additional costs incurred by the decision to split the program into
multiple stages and award stage 2 to a new shipbuilder; and increased
infrastructure costs.\14\ However, we found indicators that other
problems also pose additional risk to OPC's costs, such as the
shipbuilder's quantity of complex work remaining. Further, the program
has yet to set a cost baseline for the entire program, which currently
consists of 2 stages. The updated baseline is expected to be approved
in late fiscal year 2024. Given the program's troubled past with cost
growth on stage 1 and uncertainties surrounding stage 2, the estimated
costs for the program could be greater than the $14.6 billion reflected
in its current baseline. The pressure on the affordability of the
portfolio will likely worsen towards the end of the 5-year window of
the 2022 Capital Investment Plan. The OPC is projected to begin
requiring almost 50 percent of the Coast Guard's total acquisition
budget starting in 2026 to fund the planned two cutters per year.

Needs to Mature Technology and Design, GAO-23-105805 (Washington, D.C.:
June 20, 2023).
\14\ After Hurricane Michael devastated the original shipbuilder's
facilities, the Coast Guard split the program into two stages, with
stage 1 covering OPCs 1-4 and stage 2 covering OPCs 5-15. The Coast
Guard plans to acquire OPCs 16-25 under a separate stage.
Further, in May 2024, we found that the PSC and OPC have struggled
with achieving a stable design to support construction, as called for
by the shipbuilding leading practices that we identified in 2009.\15\
We previously found that, when a program proceeds into construction
with an unstable design, it increases the risk of completing out-of-
sequence construction and rework, which can result in further increased
cost growth, as it already has for the OPC program.

The Coast Guard also faces a bow wave of unfunded acquisitions
beyond the 5-year window of the current Capital Investment Plan. Figure
2 shows the current and future acquisitions that, based on current
Coast Guard programs and requirements, need to be addressed for the
Coast Guard to meet its statutory missions, along with the backlog of
shore infrastructure projects.\16\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Figure 2: Notional Depiction of Coast Guard Acquisition's Priorities in
Constrained Budget Environment
This bow wave of longer-term programs brings with it significant
uncertainty around the total funding the Coast Guard will need in the
future. These programs include the PSC, OPC, shore infrastructure, and
the MH-60T helicopter:
PSC. The PSC program has experienced significant schedule
delays that have affected the timing of its funding needs. In July
2023, we found the program did not have a realistic program schedule
and experienced an approximate 3-year delay in maturing the PSC's
design--which, as of May 2024, is now almost 4 years behind.\17\
According to program officials, the delay was attributable to several
factors, including U.S.-based designers and shipbuilders generally
lacking experience with heavy polar icebreakers, the complexity of the
ship design, shipbuilder design errors, design changes to meet
government specifications, and COVID-19 effects. The delay led the
program to declare a schedule breach in November 2023. The program is
in the process of updating its schedule estimates to develop a new
schedule baseline. The PSC program originally planned to complete the
design and start lead ship construction by no later than June 2021.
However, as of May 2024, Coast Guard officials stated they were
assessing the decision on when to start lead ship construction as part
of the ongoing breach remediation process.\18\

\17\ GAO, Coast Guard Acquisitions: Polar Security Cutter Needs to
Stabilize Design Before Starting Construction and Improve Schedule
Oversight, GAO-23-105949 (Washington, D.C.: July 27, 2023).
\18\ The PSC program adopted an unrealistic schedule at the outset
of the program. In September 2018, we found that the PSC's planned
delivery dates were not informed by a realistic assessment of
shipbuilding activities. We recommended that the program develop a
schedule in accordance with leading practices for project schedules to
set realistic schedule goals for all three PSCs before the contract
option for construction of the lead ship was awarded. However, we
closed the recommendation as not implemented because the program
proceeded with the award in April 2019 without developing a realistic
schedule. See GAO, Coast Guard Acquisitions: Polar Icebreaker Program
Needs to Address Risks before Committing Resources, GAO-18-600
(Washington, D.C.: Sept. 4, 2018).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is unclear when and to what extent the anticipated PSC cost
growth--which could be as high as $2 billion, as noted earlier--will
require funding given the delays and the unrealistic program schedule.
Nevertheless, it is clear that this growth will exacerbate the concerns
about the affordability of the Coast Guard's portfolio.
OPC. The Coast Guard is in the midst of fielding the most
expensive acquisition program in its portfolio--the OPC. As noted
earlier, it is uncertain whether the OPC will cost more than the $14.6
billion reflected in its most current acquisition program baseline for
25 OPCs. The Commandant of the Coast Guard has previously called the
OPC the agency's top priority. As such, the Coast Guard is likely to
prioritize the OPC in its budget requests over other acquisition
programs.
Figure 4: The Coast Guard's Offshore Patrol Cutter
However, since 2020, we have found that Coast Guard has allowed
the OPC program to repeatedly move forward through key acquisition
decisions, despite significant risks with the program.\19\ To help
mitigate some of the risks, in October 2020, we recommended that the
program mature technology for the davit--a crane that lowers and raises
a ship's small boats--for stage 1 ships prior to moving further through
construction.\20\ DHS concurred with this recommendation. In June 2023,
the program had not yet developed a plan to mature the technology.\21\
As of August 2023, the Coast Guard said that it was still tracking two
remaining high-risk issues with the davit--one of which may have
implications for completing the design of a portion of the ship.
Further, the Coast Guard awarded a detail design and construction
contract for the stage 2 ships without adequately maturing the stage 2
davit. It remains to be seen how the Coast Guard will manage stage 2 of
the program and the consequences this will have on the longer-term
affordability of the portfolio.\22\

\22\ The Coast Guard plans to start lead ship construction for OPC
stage 2 by September 2024. We will continue to monitor the program's

Shore infrastructure. In February 2019, we found that the
Coast Guard is confronted with a costly backlog of shore infrastructure
projects--related to piers, docks, boat stations, air stations, and
housing units--that is contributing to concerns of affordability for
its recapitalization and related sustainment efforts.\23\ This backlog
totaled at least $2.6 billion at that time. We also found that Coast
Guard budget requests did not provide accurate information about its
shore infrastructure needs. Specifically, Coast Guard targets for
recapitalization of shore assets exceeded $290 million annually.
However, budget requests for fiscal years 2012 through 2018 ranged from
about $5 million to about $99 million annually. Further, at various
points during this period, the Coast Guard received more funding than
requested for shore infrastructure needs, ranging from about $5 million
to about $130 million annually.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Figure 5: Damage at Station Port Aransas in Texas, Resulting from
Hurricane Harvey in 2017
We recommended that the Coast Guard include supporting details
about competing project alternatives and report trade-offs in
congressional budget requests and related reports. In 2019, DHS agreed
with our recommendation, but the Coast Guard noted, in 2021, that
addressing this recommendation is challenging due to limitations such
as budget caps imposed by OMB and DHS. As of January 2024, the Coast
Guard was working toward publishing some related information on its
website, according to officials, such as its shore infrastructure
annual report. Without such information about Coast Guard's realistic
budgetary requirements, Congress will lack critical information that
could help to prioritize funding to address the Coast Guard's shore
infrastructure backlogs. This situation could worsen as the Coast Guard
will likely require additional infrastructure upgrades for the three
PSCs and future Arctic Security Cutters. We continue to believe that
implementing this recommendation will aid decision-makers and the Coast
Guard in making better trade-off decisions.
Further, since identifying the $2.6 billion in shore
infrastructure costs in our February 2019 report, we found additional
shore infrastructure costs related to the Coast Guard's plans for
increasing its fleet of MH-60T helicopters. The Coast Guard estimates
that this expansion will require $1.3 billion in air station
infrastructure upgrades. It is unclear how the Coast Guard intends to
pay for these upgrades given the large backlog of infrastructure
projects previously identified.
MH-60T. In January 2021, the Coast Guard decided to
consolidate its helicopter fleet to an all medium-range (MH-60T) fleet
and phase out its short-range (MH-65D/E) fleet. This would grow the MH-
60T fleet by 79 aircraft. According to Coast Guard documentation, it
made this decision because the MH-65D/E helicopter manufacturer ended
production of the helicopter in 2018. The Coast Guard noted that this
led to an increased difficulty in obtaining critical parts, such as
gearboxes, which decreased fleet availability. As a result, the Coast
Guard had to reduce flight hours for the MH-65D/E fleet. The Coast
Guard plans for its future helicopter fleet to be comprised of at least
127 MH-60T helicopters.\24\ Once implemented, the Coast Guard's fleet
size would be 13 percent smaller--moving from its current 146 units to
at least 127 units.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\24\ As stated above, the Coast Guard estimates that, as part of
growing the MH-60T fleet, it will require $1.32 billion for air station
infrastructure changes to accommodate the larger MH-60T aircraft.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Figure 6: The Coast Guard's MH 60T Helicopter
However, as we found in April 2024, the Coast Guard has not
assessed whether the MH-60T helicopter best meets its mission needs
under its plans to consolidate its fleet.\25\ This is because the Coast
Guard did not assess alternatives to support this approach. Coast Guard
officials stated that the MH-60T helicopter is more capable than the
MH-65D/E. However, questions remain on its ability to meet certain
mission demands, particularly those operations that require helicopters
to operate and be secured on a cutter. We recommended that the
Commandant of the Coast Guard assess the type of helicopters the Coast
Guard requires to meet its mission demands, as part of an analysis of
alternatives. DHS agreed with this recommendation but noted that the
Coast Guard had already assessed the type and number of helicopters it
needed to meet its mission demands, based on a 2020 RAND study.\26\ DHS
noted that, based on that study, the Coast Guard should move towards
greater medium-range helicopter recovery capacity, as those aircraft
provide favorable cost solutions and increased capability.

U.S. Coast Guard Airpower Needs: Assessing the Options, (2020). The
Homeland Security Operational Analysis Center is a federally funded
research and development center operated by the RAND Corporation under
contract with the Department of Homeland Security.
However, as we stated in our April 2024 report, the RAND study
also supported the Coast Guard maintaining a mix of helicopter types.
Specifically, the RAND study identified a benefit to the Coast Guard
having a fleet composed primarily of MH-60T helicopters along with
sufficient short-range helicopters to complete certain missions, such
as drug interdiction. However, the Coast Guard did not assess
alternative helicopters to the MH-60T that may meet its cutter
deployment demands. Notably, during our review, Coast Guard
headquarters officials stated that they could benefit from assessing
different helicopter types to guide their acquisition approach and
address capability shortfalls before the introduction of the MH-60T
program's successor. As we stated in our April 2024 report, the Coast
Guard can benefit from further analysis as it examines how its
helicopter fleet can best meet its mission demands in the coming
decades. We continue to support our recommendation that an analysis of
alternatives would help the Coast Guard make the best use of its
resources.
Key Questions Remain About the Affordability of the Portfolio
Decision-makers, including Congress, OMB, DHS, and Coast Guard will
have to make difficult decisions to address the affordability concerns
surrounding the Coast Guard's acquisition portfolio.\27\ Key questions
to inform those decisions include:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\27\ In May 2024, we testified on steps that Coast Guard could take
to improve its acquisition outcomes, including implementing GAO's prior
recommendations and considering adoption of ship design leading
practices. See GAO-24-107488 and GAO, Navy Shipbuilding: Increased Use
of Leading Design Practices Could Improve Timeliness of Deliveries,
GAO-24-105503 (Washington, D.C.: May 2, 2024).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
What steps can Coast Guard take to better manage its
acquisition programs to achieve better cost and schedule outcomes?
When will Coast Guard, in coordination with OMB and DHS,
develop a long-term plan to inform the affordability of Coast Guard's
acquisition portfolio?
Which programs will decision-makers cut, reduce, or defer
to balance the affordability of the Coast Guard portfolio?
What capability gaps or reductions in mission capability
will Coast Guard operators and the public face because of the
unaffordable portfolio?
Our prior recommendations and matters for Congress, if implemented,
will help inform actions to address these questions.
In conclusion, the Coast Guard's persistent challenges in managing
its programs within established cost and schedule goals highlight the
need for the Coast Guard to reexamine how it manages its acquisition
portfolio. Since 2012, we have made 48 recommendations to DHS and the
Coast Guard on how to better manage the Coast Guard's portfolio of
major acquisition programs. Currently, we have 16 recommendations that
the Coast Guard has yet to fully address and eight others that we
closed because of Coast Guard's inaction or because they were overcome
by events. Fully addressing the remaining recommendations will help
position the Coast Guard to make hard decisions about its
portfolio.\28\

Additionally, I wanted to note how important your oversight has
been to help the Coast Guard make difficult trade-off decisions.
Ensuring that decision-makers answer those key questions I posed
earlier should help provide you with better information moving forward
to provide oversight of the Coast Guard's budget. Similarly, over the
last 13 years, we have made four matters for congressional
consideration to improve the management of Coast Guard acquisitions,
including the affordability of the portfolio.\29\ Congress has yet to
act on two of these matters, including that the Coast Guard update its
acquisition policy to establish that all shipbuilding programs should
1) mature critical technologies to a technology readiness level 7 prior
to a program's contract award for detailed design and construction, and
2) achieve 100 percent completion of basic and functional design prior
to the start of lead ship construction.\30\ Another matter was closed
as not implemented when it became overcome by events due to changes the
Coast Guard made to the information included in the Capital Investment
Plan. I encourage you to consider these matters as you deliberate the
Coast Guard's current budget request.

Chairman Webster, Ranking Member Carbajal, and Members of the
Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement. I would be pleased
to respond to any questions that you may have at this time.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you for your testimony. I
really appreciate that.
And now comes questions. I yield myself 5 minutes for
questions.
Admiral Thomas, prior to the hearing, this committee
requested an updated 5-year capital improvement plan, but we
were told basically don't expect it.
As a result, we are kind of relying on an old one from back
in 2022. As we explore throughout this hearing, circumstances
have changed since fiscal year 2023. Why can't the Coast Guard
produce an updated capital investment plan?
Admiral Thomas. Mr. Chairman, we owe you an updated CIP. We
are working through the Department right now. We expect to have
a 2024 CIP to the committee by this summer, and we have already
begun work on the fiscal year 2025 CIP. So, we have that for
action, sir.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Will it be before you leave?
Admiral Thomas. Not much is going to happen between now and
when I leave, but it will happen this summer.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Ms. Oakley, anything you would like
to add, why the CIP is important to the acquisition planning
process?
Ms. Oakley. Yes, I mean, the CIP at least provides some
information beyond the current budget year in terms of what the
Coast Guard's priorities are and what it is looking to fund.
But it doesn't provide the necessary information that matches
what is realistically going to be attained in the budget. And
so, the CIP is kind of the perfect example of looking at that
kind of bow wave of funding that is going to be required in the
outyears.
And so, I think we have some open recommendations to the
Coast Guard to really take a look at improving the information
included in the CIP that includes better information on the
risks that are being accepted by the decisions and then
identifying realistic resources that are needed to address the
acquisition program priorities.
And I would encourage the Coast Guard to incorporate those
as they are working on the future CIPs.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Admiral Thomas, Coast Guard
reported challenges in meeting mission demands, including the
$1.77 billion that is there in the backlog.
What is the minimum amount of annual funding needed for the
Coast Guard to prevent the growth of the total shoreside
infrastructure backlog?
Admiral Thomas. Mr. Chairman, thank you for this
committee's continuous focus on our shore infrastructure
because it is as critical to our mission success as anything
that floats or flies.
We have a shore infrastructure portfolio valued at about
$24 billion. Industry standards would say you need to invest 2
to 4 percent of your infrastructure portfolio each year to
maintain it. For us, that would mean steady, regular O&S
funding of around a half a billion dollars. That would allow us
to get after our maintenance backlog. And then, of course, we
would need the PC&I money to do the recapitalization and new
infrastructure that we need.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Do you have a long-term plan to
modernize your shoreside infrastructure? Does it include
efforts to modernize the process by which the Coast Guard
plans, designs, and builds shoreside infrastructure?
Admiral Thomas. We do. We are currently in the midst of
modernizing our civil engineering program, and one of the key
aspects of that is to ask Congress for more money to do survey
and design work so that we can then come back with more
realistic requests for what it is going to take to do our shore
infrastructure upgrades and maintenance.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Do you think that will live within
the confines of the President's overall total?
Admiral Thomas. I am sorry, Congressman. I didn't quite
catch that.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Do you think that all you just said
will live within the confines of the President's overall
request?
Admiral Thomas. I think the--our Commandant has said we
need to be a $20 billion Coast Guard. And, until we are there,
we are not going to be able to get after any of these backlog
numbers.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Ms. Oakley, would you like to
respond to that also?
Ms. Oakley. I mean, $2.6 billion is quite a significant
backlog, and I think that only includes costs of projects that
have cost estimates.
And there are about 200-plus more projects that still to be
estimated that continue to add to that backlog, not to mention
additional shoreside infrastructure that will be required for
new mission sets like in the Arctic that need to be considered
as they are making decisions about how to fund and how to dig
out of that hole and build for the future.
It is important work, and I know we are doing some work for
you all to update some of our work from 2019 and provide you
new data on what those numbers are from a shoreside
perspective. So, look for that in the coming months.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Well, my time has run out.
So, Mr. Carbajal, you are recognized.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Ms. Oakley, the Polar Security Cutter and Offshore Patrol
Cutter programs are both behind schedule and over budget. On
both programs, complications have arisen due to an immature
level of design.
While the Coast Guard generally follows the Navy's
standards for design completion before moving to production,
what is the effect of starting construction before obtaining a
mature design?
Ms. Oakley. Put simply, the lack of knowledge leads to
decisions to move forward that aren't well-informed about what
the resources or risks are going to be associated with the
effort.
And so, when you think about it from the perspective of you
wouldn't start building your house before it has been designed,
right? And so, very simply, those are the kinds of decisions
that we are talking about.
And so, we have been recommending for many years to both
the Coast Guard and the Navy to put in that early effort, put
in that early time to really understand that basic and
functional design, what the structure is going to look like,
where the major systems are going to be, how the piping is
going to run through the ship, to be able to then have
confidence, as you are stepping into the construction period
for those ships, where it becomes more expensive to make
changes that might be necessary as the design continues to
evolve.
And I think that, unfortunately, when you see bad outcomes,
it is a result of continuing instability in the design that is
leading to changes that become increasingly expensive as you
move through the construction process.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. It sounds like the F-35 in the
House Armed Services.
Admiral Thomas, each of the new assets we have discussed
today will require experienced Coast Guard servicemembers to
operate and maintain them. It is critical that we pair these
investments with initiatives to address the 10-percent
personnel shortage that the Coast Guard is facing.
How will the new assets and investments in infrastructure
further Coast Guard's efforts to recruit and retain a diverse
cadre of personnel? And what else is the Coast Guard doing to
ensure its workforce is sufficient to manage these assets and
carry out its missions?
Admiral Thomas. Well, thank you for that question, Ranking
Member Carbajal.
Absolutely, the workforce is what makes these assets come
to life and get the mission done.
One of the things that we can do to improve our retention
and recruiting is to provide world-class shore infrastructure
for our forces to work in.
I think Congressman Larsen mentioned he has visited a
number of areas where the conditions that we are asking our
people to work in are just substandard. That doesn't help us
retain our workforce.
I am happy to report we are making progress with our
recruiting. We are at record numbers this year; numbers we
haven't seen since prior to COVID. And our retention is up, as
well. So, we are working on closing that workforce gap.
But the fact of the matter is we do not currently have the
capacity at our accession points to meet the future workforce
demands of our Service. We cannot get enough people through
Cape May each year without building infrastructure there, and
we cannot get enough people through the Coast Guard Academy
each year for our future needs without improving infrastructure
there.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
Ms. Oakley, the Polar Security Cutter program is now over 5
years behind its initial schedule in part due to challenges
associated with its shipbuilding programs. These delays are
associated with $2 billion in cost increases.
How important are investments in commercial U.S. shipyards
and shipbuilding to ensure cost efficiency for the Coast Guard
and the Navy, and how else can the Coast Guard improve its
shipbuilding outcomes?
Ms. Oakley. Well, in general, supporting the U.S.
shipbuilding industrial base is critical, given what both the
Coast Guard and the Navy are trying to do in terms of building
up their fleets to meet their increasing mission demands.
One thing that I would like to comment on that is I see
this as needing to be a whole-of-Government approach to
supporting that industrial base. And, in preparing for this
hearing, I am reviewing the Navy's 30-year fleet shipbuilding
plan. And it talks a lot about industrial base and supporting
the naval industrial base and the commercial industrial base,
but the Coast Guard isn't mentioned in there at all.
And so, I think that is one thing that the Navy and the
Coast Guard need to think about is how they can kind of
approach and attack this holistically, because there is a lot
of money right now being thrown at the shipbuilding industrial
base through the Navy and through the Department of Defense, in
particular.
And so, I think that the Coast Guard will benefit from
that, but I would like the Coast Guard to be a little bit more
strategic in directing those benefits to things that will
support them in the long run.
And then, just to quickly answer your question about
improving outcomes, the Coast Guard should really look toward
the practices that we have identified by going out and looking
at commercial shipbuilders and buyers and how they go about
getting ships done on time and on budget and on predictable
cycle.
And I don't mean done in 10 years. I mean done, designed to
launch in less than 4 years sometimes for very complex ships.
There is a reason why they can do that, because they take
disciplined approaches. They put in place the right kinds of
tools. They have the right kinds of expertise to be able to
oversee these programs and execute these programs, and that is
where I direct both the Coast Guard and the Navy to begin
looking to, to improve their outcomes.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
And I will be following up, sitting on House Armed
Services, on this collaborative shipbuilding issue.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I yield back.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Mr. Ezell, you are recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you both for being here today. We appreciate it.
Our priorities are the same. They were the last time we had
our hearing here. Congress must do all it can to help the
shipbuilding industry by ensuring efficiency and transparency,
bolstering the workforce, and incentivizing domestic
shipbuilding.
Ms. Oakley, what are the three top actions that Congress
can take to help address the affordability challenges the Coast
Guard is facing now?
Ms. Oakley. There are a couple of things.
First, the Congress should really enforce what it has asked
the Coast Guard to do, develop a 20-year fleet modernization
plan so that you-all have the ammunition to be able to advocate
for additional resources for the Coast Guard to be able to meet
its increasing mission needs. So, that is one thing.
The Coast Guard has yet to develop that type of plan. The
Navy develops one every year. So, I don't see that there should
be any reason why the Coast Guard couldn't follow suit to
provide you-all with that information.
The second thing I would say is that the Congress should
demand the Coast Guard to push forward with disciplined
programs. And, when I say ``disciplined programs,'' I mean
following those practices that I was talking about from the
commercial ship buyers and builders, not making decisions to
proceed with construction with a design that is not even
remotely finished to be able to support informed decisions in
that regard, and really push the Coast Guard to think about
what it needs and how it is going to effectively prioritize and
assess the risks associated with its future portfolio.
And it can do that in that long-term plan or it can do that
in that CIP that we talked about earlier, that capital
investment plan. So, those are just some quick things that I
think you-all could do.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you very much.
Admiral Thomas, how do you respond to the claims that the
Coast Guard has a lot of redtape? And can you describe some of
the changes you are making to make more people want to bid on
these contracts? Help us get here.
Admiral Thomas. So, Congressman, I would say that the
redtape in the Coast Guard is the redtape that is in Federal
law, regulations, and requirements from our Department.
The Coast Guard is one of the premier agencies in all of
Government that does business with small businesses, and I am
proud of that fact. We work hard to ensure that we can send our
business to small businesses.
Mr. Ezell. Very good.
How can this committee better equip the Coast Guard with
the tools it needs to provide detailed and accurate information
relating to communication and transparency in the acquisition
process? How can we help you?
Admiral Thomas. I would have to have a conversation with
you, Congressman, to understand where you think there is a lack
of communication and transparency.
I think the key is in our budget requests.
Mr. Ezell. OK.
Admiral Thomas. And that is where your frustration lies.
And our budget request for fiscal year 2024, particularly
in our PC&I was, you know, we asked for more than we got.
Mr. Ezell. OK. Got it.
In your testimony, you mentioned a recent acquisition of
the Nation's first heavy polar icebreakers in over four
decades. How do you plan to navigate this process and meet
deadlines since no shipyard has built an icebreaker in all
these decades?
Admiral Thomas. Yes, so, that is a very key point, and I am
glad that you brought it up. The polar icebreaker is not like
any commercial vessel ever built, and it is not like any vessel
built in the United States ever.
So, it is a complex vessel, and it is a complex--we are
currently working with the shipyard. They have put in what is
called a Request for Equitable Adjustment to kind of rightsize
the contract.
That, combined with the work we are doing to understand
their overtarget budget, overtarget schedule analysis, I think
will allow us to report to this committee a good estimate in
both cost and schedule by this fall.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you.
We toured down there recently a few months ago, and it was
really neat to see the innovation that is going on in Bollinger
down there. So, thank you very much for that.
The last question is for the panel, if we have time. This
committee has heard that one of the challenges in building a
PSC is the support of the local industrial base, that is,
finding enough workers.
What can we do to try to help everybody, I guess you would
say? Because we hear that all over the place, we are having
problems finding people. What can we do to help that?
Admiral Thomas. So, I think there are two things that we
need to do. One is we need to invest in our shipyards. And we
need to understand that the Polar Security program will result
in ships that our Nation needs, but it will also result in a
shipyard that our Nation needs.
And the second is we need to really invest in STEM
education. We are finding that the engineers, the scientists,
the technicians that are required to put a ship that complex
together, both in terms of design and construction, just don't
exist in our Nation. So, we need to focus on that.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you.
And thank you for all your testimony and your hard work.
Mr. Chairman, yield back.
Dr. Babin . Thank you.
And now I would like to recognize the gentlewoman from
Michigan, Ms. Scholten.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you so much, sir.
And thank you to our witnesses for being here, Vice Admiral
Thomas, for your service to our country.
I have a number of questions today. So, I am going to get
right into it.
First, the Great Lakes play a vital role not only in our
local communities and back home in west Michigan, but within
the U.S. economy as a whole. These waterways are critical to
ensuring reliability of supply chains and the integrity of our
country's maritime border.
As such, I want to be as helpful as I can to support
adequate icebreaking in the Great Lakes to allow for free
movement of cargo in the region year-round. While we have had
minimal ice this particular year, next year is a different
story.
Vice Admiral, despite receiving $20 million in fiscal year
2024 and over $19 million in previous years, the Coast Guard
has not officially designated a new heavy Great Lakes
icebreaker as acquisition in this program of record.
Given the importance of the region, is there anything
preventing the Coast Guard, sir, from accelerated acquisition
of an additional icebreaker beyond access to funding?
Admiral Thomas. Congresswoman, I share your passion for the
Great Lakes. It is a national treasure, and we are committed to
recapitalizing our system of icebreakers there. We think we
need 2 heavies, about 11 mediums, and about 7 of the smaller
ones so we can essentially plow the highways, the side roads,
and the parking lots.
We are moving forward. We are at AD1, Access Decision 1,
with the GLIB, the Great Lakes icebreaker. The money that was
appropriated in fiscal year 2024 will allow us to move forward
with the analyze-and-select phase.
We are going to need additional appropriations to move
forward with that particular acquisition, but it is a program
of record. We have a program office, and we are moving forward.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you. I appreciate that, sir.
I appreciate this discussion, and frankly, I had a lot more
questions today that I was hoping to talk about with respect to
the GLIB program. But, unfortunately, the U.S. Coast Guard is
once again in the headlines for horrible mishandling of sexual
assault cases related to Operation Fouled Anchor. I would be
remiss if I didn't ask some questions here.
First and foremost, sir, while the Coast Guard has been
before this committee and other committees many times, talking
about the tragedy and the impact on these victims, sir, is the
Coast Guard leadership aware of the impact on everyday citizens
that distractions like these continue to have over and over
again?
The subject matter of today's hearing is where we are
behind on so many of these different programs. And I can't help
but notice we are not able to get to the questions that we need
today because we are also talking about yet another scandal.
Does the Coast Guard appreciate the lack of fiscal
responsibility, as well, that scandals continue to have on the
program itself?
Admiral Thomas. First, Congresswoman, let me just offer you
an in-person brief on GLIB so we can answer all your questions.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you, sir.
Admiral Thomas. I appreciate your recognition that the
ongoing disclosures regarding sexual assaults and unacceptable
behavior in the Coast Guard can be a distraction, not just for
our Service and our servicemembers, but for the Nation because
they lose focus on all the good news that is in our Service.
That is why we are really focused hard on improving and
strengthening our Service culture, providing all the support
that we can to victims. I had mentioned earlier that I stand
personally ready to help victims access the healthcare that
they need at the VA, and we have an enterprise victim advocate
to do that.
But you are absolutely right. It can be a distraction, and
it can take away from the good story of the Coast Guard.
Ms. Scholten. Sir, I appreciate your comments. As everyone
here knows and as we heard in the testimony in the Senate,
unfortunately, these most recent allegations were about how
these instances are continuing to be ongoing.
And I am wondering what the Coast Guard is doing to ensure
transparency in the process so that the American public can
trust that what you are saying now is true; that, even as we
speak, that there are not coverups like this happening.
Admiral Thomas. Our Commandant has testified--and you can
choose to assess the veracity of her testimony--that we are,
she is absolutely committed to being transparent.
I am personally responsible for our sexual assault
prevention and response program. I spend a lot of time working
on it, and we are being as transparent as we possibly can.
Ms. Scholten. I don't mean to interrupt you, sir. I have
one more very important question and I just--I would ask you
that, you know, we have heard a lot of words.
And I think the American public and this committee--I know
I personally am going to need a lot more than words to assure
us of the veracity of these assurances that these will continue
to be taken seriously.
One of the most horrifying details I think to come out of
this is that victims were not provided with the CG-6095 that
would ensure access to VA health benefits. I think it goes
without saying, sir, that survivors should never be denied
benefits in an attempt to help the Coast Guard protect its
reputation.
What are you doing to ensure that every survivor, both in
the past and in the future, even those we don't yet know about,
is provided with a CG-6095, ensuring their access to benefits?
Admiral Thomas. So, I have a CG-6095 right here. We do
provide them.
Ms. Scholten. Do the survivors have it, sir, is the
question.
Admiral Thomas. So, we have an enterprise victim advocate
that is available to survivors who can get access to this form.
Our sexual assault response coordinators around the Coast Guard
have access to the form.
And this week, I will recommunicate both internally and
externally through social media where victims can go to get
these forms so that we can assure that they get the care that
they deserve and that they need.
Ms. Scholten. I would ask that you provide a more proactive
approach to make sure that these survivors have actually access
to these forms, sir.
Admiral Thomas. We will, Congresswoman, including outreach
to known victims. We have done that over the course of the last
year.
Ms. Scholten. Our personnel, our Coasties across the
country are the most precious resource that the Coast Guard
has, sir, and we ask you to look out for them in every possible
way.
I yield back the remainder of my time.
Dr. Babin. The gentlewoman's time has expired. Thank you
very much.
Admiral Thomas. It is my greatest privilege to look out for
our workforce.
Dr. Babin. I want to thank the witnesses for being here
today.
First off, I would like say how much southeast Texas, where
my district is, appreciates all the hard work that the Coast
Guard has been doing in responding to our recent storms in
southeast Texas. I have five or six of my counties have been
declared disasters, as well as several other congressional
districts.
My question is to you, Admiral. As the Coast Guard looks to
transition to the MH-60 rotary-wing fleet, I understand that
the Coast Guard is slowly phasing out many of its aging MH-65s
with the intention of reducing the overall rotary-wing fleet.
Air Station Houston currently hosts three MH-65 Dolphin
helicopters, and I understand that the current plan is to phase
these three helicopters out and replace them with just two MH-
60s. And, while I recognize that the MH-60 is a very capable
platform compared with the MH-65, I have concerns that reducing
the number of airframes in service may impact the Coast Guard's
operational capabilities.
Presumably with just two aircraft at Air Station Houston,
it would be more challenging to respond to multiple search-and-
rescue missions, storm responses, or providing support to the
Houston ship channel, given that a single helicopter can only
be in one place at one time with the reality that individual
helicopters are often stuck in the hangar, dealing with
maintenance issues.
In addition, for Air Station Houston, I understand there
may be some issues regarding the hangar size and space and
ability to facilitate the 60s. Do you have any information
available on the plan moving forward at Air Station Houston's
air assets? Briefly, if you would.
Admiral Thomas. Yes, so, Congressman, I will just say I am
familiar with high-water events in southeast Texas. I was in
command in Galveston when Allison hit, and I was in command of
the eighth district when Harvey hit. And we saved tens of
thousands of people using aircraft from Air Station Houston and
surged in aircraft. In the most recent event, Air Station
Houston was able to medevac a 12-hour-old baby to neonatal care
who was isolated by the floods. So, Air Station Houston is an
asset for that area, and we will continue to fly our aircraft
out of there.
We will have to make some modifications across the country
to our hangars in order to accommodate the 60s. It is another
reason why we need a $3 to $3.4 billion PC&I budget so we can
build the aircraft and the hangars.
Dr. Babin. So, it is a funding issue.
Admiral Thomas. Absolutely.
Dr. Babin. You just don't have the funds to get more than
three.
Admiral Thomas. Right now, we have a program of record of
127 60s. If we are going to grow that, it is going to require
more funds.
Dr. Babin. OK. Considering the pending polar icebreaker
construction program, I understand the construction contracts
for the polar program and the Great Lakes program require all
United States laws to be followed.
Has the question of propulsion arrangement and patent
rights been resolved in the case of the polar program, and, if
not, why not? And how do you propose to resolve that question
so that lawsuits and further delays do not occur?
Admiral Thomas. So, to date, there have been no official
raising of patent issues associated with the polar icebreaker.
So, we haven't taken any actions to resolve those because there
just haven't been any claims.
Dr. Babin. OK. As the Coast Guard explores ways to make the
most of its limited funding, operation and procurement of long-
range air assets presents a significant challenge. The Coast
Guard currently collaborates with CBP regarding the use of
long-range autonomous systems including the use of Coast Guard
pilots and the use of systems in key areas of Coast Guard
operation.
Given the ability of these systems to expand the Coast
Guard's ability to monitor large areas in a cost-effective
manner, the fact that the HC-130J program appears stalled at 19
airframes and the apparent shift away from the C-27 program,
does the Coast Guard plan to explore the acquisition of its own
long-range UAS systems? And what sort of unmanned systems could
provide the Coast Guard with more complete persistent marine
domain awareness?
Admiral Thomas. Yes, we absolutely need to move into
unmanned systems, particularly for our maritime patrol
missions. In fiscal year 2025 budget, we have about $100
million aimed just at doing that. We do operate the MQ-9s with
CBP. We think that is probably the platform that we need as we
build out our fleet, but we are also going to need to build
more than our current program of record of C-130s because we
are sunsetting the C-27s.
Dr. Babin. OK. Thank you, and I appreciate you very much.
We certainly need to up our ante on--I know you need the
funding, but we have got to have enough airframes to get things
done.
So, with that, I will yield myself back and recognize the
gentlewoman from Alaska, Mrs. Peltola.
Mrs. Peltola. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
My first questions are for Admiral Thomas. Thank you for
being here. Thank you for your service to our country.
The Coast Guard has previously said that the acquisition of
the Polar Security Cutter, which you mentioned a little bit
ago, is the Coast Guard's top acquisition priority.
And ensuring that the program stays on track and that the
Coast Guard has the resourcing it needs to oversee that
program, while staying on top of recapitalization priorities in
all your other places, is one of my top priorities, as well, as
a Member of the House.
In a Homeland Security hearing a few weeks ago, the Coast
Guard indicated that the design for the Polar Security Cutter
was about 65 percent completed. And I am wondering when you
estimate being able to begin the construction phase. And do you
have an updated estimate for when the first Polar Security
Cutter will be off the assembly line, in the water, and ready
to go?
Admiral Thomas. So, we are in the process of getting much
greater clarity on both cost and schedule, and I think we will
have that this fall. We are working with the contractor both in
terms of renegotiating portions of the contract but also at
analysis they are doing to look at their cost and schedule.
That said, we have seen an increase in design maturity that
leads us to be optimistic about being able to authorize start
of construction by the end of this year.
I will say that I don't think we will be at 90 percent
design maturity. That term ``design maturity'' is defined
differently in different places. But we will certainly be at
the level of maturity that we need to start the modules that we
start. So, we are optimistic we will start this year.
Mrs. Peltola. OK. That is good news.
And are you able to provide an update on the acquisition of
the commercially available icebreaker that the Coast Guard
received funding for in the fiscal year 2024 appropriation
cycle?
Admiral Thomas. Well, first of all, we appreciate the
support of Congress to get the money to acquire a commercial
icebreaker that will increase our ability to be present and to
match presence with presence in the Arctic, and particularly
off of Alaska.
The next step is the request for proposal that we are
working on. There is one sole source. We are going to see what
we can actually buy for the $125 million that we got.
But, critical, we asked for about $20 million in O&S
funding so that we can outfit and operate that vessel. And, in
fiscal year 2024, that was reduced to $1 million.
So, we are going to need an additional appropriation fiscal
year 2025 so that we can operate what we buy.
Mrs. Peltola. OK. That is a very good heads-up.
And one of the things my office is tracking are the three
major homeporting projects currently in Alaska.
And I like to remind people that, if Alaska were a country,
we would be the 18th largest country, and we have more
coastline than all of the lower 48 combined. At low tide,
Alaska could fit three Texases inside of us. So, we are
enormous.
And really, you are our presence. And we know that we have
had foreign adversaries practicing war drills in our waters off
our shores, and we really appreciate you being there and the
presence of the Coast Guard.
And that is not even to mention the search-and-rescue
operations that you provide, it seems like every week or
multiple times a week. As Alaskans, we are very dependent on
you. Our fishing industry is dependent on you. Our tourists are
very dependent on you.
So, regarding the three major homeporting projects, there
is a Fast Response Cutter headed to Seward, there is a Fast
Response Cutter headed to Sitka, and the commercially available
icebreaker will be homeported in Juneau.
And I am wondering if you could give us an update on how
those projects are going.
Admiral Thomas. Absolutely. I've been focused on our Alaska
projects. Our crews love to work and live in Alaska. In Seward
in particular, we have acquired the property that we need. We
requested about $42 million to build out the FRC facility
there. We've been appropriated about $25 million. We think we
can put a pier there. We probably can't put the support
buildings there that we need for that. So, we're going to need
additional appropriation there.
The challenge in Seward is that we need to build housing as
well, and though we've gotten appropriated about $13 million to
do that, that will get us property and utilities. It won't
actually build us homes. We're working with a community there
and community builders.
In Sitka, we have enough money to build the FRC pier and
recapitalize the buoy tender pier but not enough yet to build
the buildings ashore, and we're still working our way through
negotiations with regard to acquiring land.
With regard to Juneau, there's not been any appropriations
to build a home port in Juneau. So, we haven't even begun the
planning process there.
Mrs. Peltola. OK. Thank you for that update. In Admiral
Fagan's state of the Coast Guard speech last year, she said
that the American taxpayer won't find a better return on
investment than the U.S. Coast Guard, and I agree with her. I
have a continued frustration by the size of the Coast Guard's
budget year after year. I am a big proponent of making
investments where they need to be made. I've heard some say
that the Coast Guard should be about a $20 billion organization
as you mentioned earlier. In a world where the Coast Guard were
to receive a major uptick in funding, what are some of the
acquisitions or initiatives that the additional funding would
be spent on?
Admiral Thomas. So, I've said that the Coast Guard is a $20
billion organization on a $13 billion diet. The Space Force is
a $40 billion budget. The Space Force has a $10 billion PC&I
budget. If we had a $3.4 billion PC&I reliable current year
dollars, we could get after all the home port work that we just
talked about, all the shore infrastructure recapitalization,
and our current program on record with regard to ships and
aircraft.
Mrs. Peltola. OK. I apologize for going over time, Mr.
Chairman. Thank you very much.
Admiral Thomas. Thank you.
Dr. Van Drew . The gentlelady yields back, and I
recognize myself for 5 minutes. Thank you for being here.
Vice Admiral, Training Center Cape May has many projects in
urgent need of completion, as you know, especially the
barracks. I'm glad to see that $225 million is authorized in
FY25 for the improvements to facilities at the training center
and an additional $60 million for the barracks for phase 2.
However, I've been getting mixed messages about the status of
phase 1, and I'd really like to clarify that. Vice Admiral
Thomas, thank you again for being here today. We do appreciate
you even when we are giving you tough questions. That's part of
the deal, right?
Admiral Thomas. It's part of the deal.
Dr. Van Drew. You didn't expect to come here for the easy
questions. Can you provide an update on the progress for phase
1 of the barracks? Are there any problems in the bidding, the
contracting process, and when can we expect construction to
actually begin?
Admiral Thomas. We have not encountered any problems. We
are just about to issue the request for proposal. I think, just
to be honest with you, we asked for money in FY22, and it's a
totally different market than what we have now. So, we will do
a design-bid-build RFP, and we will get what we can get for the
$55 million that we have. I think that the phase 2 will be more
than $60 million if we are truly going to build what we need to
build there. And then we need to continue to invest in Cape
May, because as I've said earlier, the size of our future
workforce, we cannot support it right now with the capacity
that we have at Cape May.
Dr. Van Drew. I'd love to know those numbers, and I
understand what you're saying about phase 1, and originally,
actually, I understand it was going to be enough. Inflation,
God knows we know what inflation is doing to the country in
general.
Secondly, we then had approached you-all and said, ``Do you
need more money?'' Originally yes, and then you said, ``No,
we're going to be OK. We're going to live with this amount.
We're going to live under that budget,'' and I assume that's
where you are now.
Admiral Thomas. As I said, we're going to do a design-bid-
build, and we're going to get what we get for the money that we
have.
Dr. Van Drew. OK. I have to think on that a little bit. And
you assume--obviously, you're going to get what you're going to
get, but it has to be adequate. It has to be appropriate. It
has to fulfill the needs that we have.
Admiral Thomas. Congressman, if we can't get--if we can't
get something that will be functional and suitable, then we
will come back and ask for more money.
Dr. Van Drew. Right. Which we approached you on that, and
you said you didn't think you would. I want to be clear. If
it's not good and it's not the right thing--and believe me, I
don't like spending money. We've got a lot of debt. But we also
have to take care of what's most important, which is our
military, which includes the Coast Guard, which includes you-
all, which includes the biggest training center in the country,
which is Cape May. If we need to do that, then we need to know
that. We need to open those lines--if I sound--we need to open
those lines of communication.
Admiral Thomas. I'm committed to keeping you informed,
Congressman, on where we stand, and we will know more as we put
out that RFP this summer.
Dr. Van Drew. So, I'm really looking forward to the RFP,
and we should know a lot more, period, whether we need more
money, et cetera. And the real timeframe. We'd love to really
get a start date here. We hope to have that definitely by this
summer.
Training Center Cape May has prepared a draft strategic
development plan which identifies potential projects over a 25-
year horizon, and I know you're familiar with it. I've
previously requested this information, and the Coast Guard has
referred me to the traditional budget process through the
Office of Management and Budget, OMB, which is fine, but let's
be clear. Congress is a co-equal branch of Government. It is
essential as the oversight branch, and that we are, that we're
able to communicate directly with agencies, and we absolutely
appropriate to do so on the budgetary matters that this
Congress oversees.
From my and this committee's legislative goals, it's
important that we're able to see this plan, this 25-year plan,
and work to provide for the proposed projects as the Coast
Guard outlines them. It's a relatively simple request I'm
making, Vice Admiral. It highlights, quite frankly, what's
wrong with this Government--not with you--the Government in
general. We have to plan more. We can't just plan for the year
or 2 years. It's good to have a 25-year plan. It doesn't mean
that it doesn't change, but we need a plan.
Congress has been missing a long-term outlook, and it's why
we're in a terrible fiscal position. We, as Congress, should be
able to see what such a critical asset as the Training Center
Cape May needs over the next quarter of a century, and it's
unclear to me--this is what's unclear, why the Coast Guard
deflected this request to OMB.
I want to make this real simple. I do. Will you commit to
me and this committee, because it's important to the committee
as well, that you will provide a copy of the strategic
development plan of Training Center Cape May as soon as
possible? We need to look at it. I know there will be changes
in a quarter of a century, but it gives us an overview. It
gives us a vision. Please respond.
Admiral Thomas. I can commit to providing you our area of
development plan for Training Center Cape May and all the
planning documents that go with it.
Dr. Van Drew. Which would include the 25-year plan. Part of
it--it's there. We know for a fact. So, can you commit to that?
Admiral Thomas. You know for a fact that we have a 25-year
plan?
Dr. Van Drew. That is my understanding, yes. That's what
we've been told when we asked, yes. We didn't make that up. We
asked you folks. That's what I was told.
Admiral Thomas. Absolutely. If we have it, I don't know why
we wouldn't share it. I'm not personally aware of it.
Dr. Van Drew. This is what I would ask. If you can
personally look into that. If you have it, share it, and you've
made that commitment already. If you don't have it, please
explain to me what planning documents you do have and why we
received that incorrect information so that we know how to move
forward.
Admiral Thomas. Specific to Cape May, happy to do that.
Dr. Van Drew. Specific to Cape May. I think it's a good
idea in general, but I am going to be a little parochial here.
So, we're going to start with Cape May and hopefully expand it
on.
Admiral Thomas. I'll tell you, Congressman, I kind of share
your frustration. One of the last decision memos that I have
signed is one that will establish a shore infrastructure
project office in our contracting shop so that we start buying
shore infrastructure like we buy ships and airplanes, and that
will give us the level of discipline that we need and that you
expect.
Dr. Van Drew. And I hope--that's a great goal. It's a great
goal for you, for this committee, for all of us. I thank you. I
thank you for being here. I yield back.
Are there any further questions from any members of the
subcommittee who have not been recognized? OK.
Seeing none, that concludes our hearing for today. I would
like to thank both of you for being here. I appreciate it. I
would like to thank each of the witnesses, which are you-all,
for your testimony. This subcommittee stands adjourned.

Appendix
----------
Questions to Vice Admiral Paul F. Thomas, Deputy Commandant for Mission
Support, U.S. Coast Guard, from Hon. Daniel Webster
Question 1. In your testimony, you stated that industry standards
call for a two to four percent yearly investment to properly maintain
the Coast Guard's shoreside infrastructure. Based on the Service's $24
billion property portfolio, that would equate to approximately $500
million a year in shoreside maintenance costs. However, the two to four
percent maintenance estimate assumes the facilities to which the
estimate applies have received regular ongoing maintenance. The reality
is that many shoreside assets have not received such maintenance and
already need significant investment in addition to the two to four
percent of value.
Question 1.a. To that end, what is the projected yearly cost to
prevent the Coast Guard's shoreside maintenance backlog from growing
when you factor in work that currently needs to be done to the
Service's shoreside facilities for which ongoing maintenance has long
been deferred?
Answer. Annual infrastructure maintenance funding needs are
estimated at $490M to $980M, assuming the industry and government
standard of investment at 2 to 4 percent of the Coast Guard's shore
infrastructure plant replacement value (currently $24.5B). Additional
funding is only part of the solution. It must be coupled with increased
staffing to appropriate levels and divestiture of unnecessary property,
in order to reduce the size and severity of the Coast Guard's shore
maintenance and repair backlog.
Question 1.b. What is the total size of the Coast Guard's current
shoreside maintenance backlog?
Answer. The Service's current shore maintenance backlog is
estimated at $2.7B, which includes depot-level and organizational-level
maintenance projects.
