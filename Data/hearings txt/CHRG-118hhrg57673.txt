EXAMINING CBP ONE: FUNCTIONS, FEATURES, EXPANSION, AND RISKS ---------- Thursday, March 21, 2024 U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security, Subcommittee on Border Security and Enforcement, and the Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations, and Accountability, Washington, DC. The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:54 p.m., in room 310 Cannon House Office Building, Hon. Clay Higgins (Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding. Present: Representatives Higgins, Bishop, Ezelle, Greene, Luttrell, Brecheen, Crane, Green (ex officio), Correa, Ivey, Thanedar, Ramirez, Suozzi, and Clarke. Mr. Higgins. The Committee on Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border Security and Enforcement, the Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations, and Accountability will come to order. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare the committee in recess at any point. Without objection, the gentleman from New York, Mr. D'Esposito, is permitted to sit on the dais and ask questions to the witnesses. The purpose of this hearing is to examine the expansion of the CBP One mobile application. While the app was created for commercial purposes, the Biden administration has expanded its purpose in January 2023 to allow otherwise inadmissible aliens to schedule appointments directly at ports of entry with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and be mass-paroled into the interior. I now recognize myself for an opening statement. Mr. Ranking Member and fellow Members of the committee, ladies and gentlemen appearing before us, welcome to the Subcommittee on Border Security and Enforcement, the Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations, and Accountability. This is a joint hearing on the Customs and Border Protection's CBP One mobile application. The purpose of today's hearing is to examine how the Biden administration and the Department of Homeland Security have expanded the use of CBP One to parole inadmissible aliens into the United States. This hearing will focus on DHS's use of CBP One to institute so-called lawful pathways for illegal aliens without proper documentation, the application's functions and features, and the security risks that might be exploited by cartels. DHS continues to fail in its basic homeland security mission to secure the border. Secretary Mayorkas' open border policies, fueled by the expansion of CBP One app, has allowed virtually any foreign national from abroad to make an appointment to enter the country. Simply put, this application's users know that a CBP One appointment is their ticket into the United States. In January, 2023, the Department of Homeland Security announced that CBP One would be expanded to include an appointment-scheduling function for illegal aliens without prior authorization to register for inspection and processing at ports of entry. CBP One was created to reduce wait times for perishable commercial goods passing through these ports of entry for legal trade, but the Mayorkas DHS has repurposed the CBP One app. Under Secretary Mayorkas, we have seen over 460,000 illegal aliens schedule appointments to present at these ports using the CBP One app. Most of these illegal aliens are paroled and released into the United States, and, in most cases, we really don't know who they are. This is an abuse of parole by design. CBP originally allowed 1,000 CBP One appointments per day. As of May 2023, 3 months later, it was increased to 1,450 per day. Ironically, the Department continues to praise CBP One's appointment capabilities while failing to do the thing that would solve the crisis, which is stop the flow of illegals across our Southern Border. Documents received by our committee show that from January through September 2023, more than 266,000, or nearly 96 percent of those illegal aliens who scheduled appointments via CBP One was simply issued a notice to appear and paroled into the United States. This means that only 4 percent of illegal alien parolees are detained or removed. CBP One is now being weaved into other parole programs like the Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan, with a CHNV Parole program and Family Reunification Parole, or FRP, which includes nationals and immediate family members from Columbia, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, and Honduras. Through the end of 2024, over 357,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans were granted parole. But in the end, Secretary Mayorkas' shell game doesn't end here. Illegal aliens are also taking advantage of a significant CBP One loophole, which allows them to present themselves at a port of entry instead of scheduling an appointment via the app if they experience problems due to, quote, language barrier, illiteracy, significant technical failure, or other on-going and serious obstacles. There are also numerous technical and security problems with CBP One. Secretary Mayorkas has encouraged those aliens to make use of the so-called lawfully, safe, and orderly pathways by using CBP One. Secretary Mayorkas has stated that these border policies are safe, orderly, and humane. But anyone familiar with the CBP One app knows that its border policies are somewhat of a racket designed to expedite illegal immigration into America and leave us at risk. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today.  Statement of Chairman Clay Higgins March 21, 2024 Good afternoon and welcome to the Subcommittee on Border Security and Enforcement and the Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations, and Accountability joint hearing on Custom and Border Protection's CBP One mobile application.

I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today. Mr. Higgins. I recognize the Ranking Member for his opening statement. Mr. Correa. Thank you, Chairman Higgins, for being here today. It's always important that we shoot the tires and look at the issues, look at what we're doing and really address and consider one of the most important challenges this country has had in a very, very long time. We could think about it as immigration. I look at it as immigration refugees, terrorist issue all rolled into one. CBP One is just one tool of many other tools that we have in the tool chest right now to address these issues. It's not enough, though, just to look at CBP One. We have to look also at the people that are actually coming to our ports of entry and requesting protections. We need to look at the totality of how the administration is addressing migration before people ever reach our borders. That's why I'm glad that the State Department could join us here today. Bottom line, we are witnessing today a world-wide migration movement like we've never seen hardly ever. Reasons: We're emerging from COVID, COVID that has devastated the world's economies. South of the border we have economies of nations that are essentially nonfunctional anymore. Of course, all of us read the newspaper headlines about Haiti, but there are many other headlines that I would say we never talk about on a daily basis, and all of those should also hold our attention. We have to look at this issue comprehensively. What's the challenge? What are the root causes? How to manage what I would call a world-wide migration of refugees. It's not only the United States. I've talked to the Columbian ambassador. I visited Columbia. They have 3 million Venezuelans. Costa Rica. All of you have heard me say this. The Costa Rican ambassador telling us they're struggling. They're at the breaking point with their refugees. Mexico, of course, as well. We can look at Europe as well. They have their challenges as well, and others around the country. It's not a Democrat or Republican issue. We have to work collectively to address these issues. So I am glad that, for example, myself and Congressman Luttrell put out a piece of legislation called the Emerging Innovative Border Technologies Act. Really asking the DHS to identify, integrate, and deploy cutting-age commercial technologies to improve border security. Mr. Chairman, and you, you and I have also worked on legislation together. We've got to come together and figure this out. CBP One is just one of the many tools this administration is employing to try to manage the border challenges. To be clear, under our laws, migrants have always been able to approach our ports of entry to ask for protection. This is nothing new. CBP One is just one tool that we use to manage this flow. It's not enough just to say this is a U.S. issue. It's not our issue. It's not Mexico's issue. It's not Canada's issue. It's a hemispheric issue. We've got to work with our partners, our friends to fix this issue because it's not going away. CBP One, yes. But this issue, if you go south of the border, again, look at those economies. Central America, South America. It's not going away. I ask all of you today to give us your thoughts. CBP One, I want to hear more about it. What exactly does CBP One do? My colleague, Chairman Higgins says it's a ticket to the United States. I want to know under what conditions is it a ticket into the United States. How many of those people that apply to CBP One are actually given that golden ticket to come to the United States? How many of those people that come into the United States can actually work or not work? I remember about a year, year-and-a-half ago being at the Tijuana border in Tijuana, San Ysidro border to look at the Ukrainian refugee camps that were being set up by the United States. I thought, this is the way to do it. Ukrainians that fly into Mexico, go into Tijuana, go into a baseball field that had been, essentially, created into a makeshift refugee center. Those refugees would come in. Within 48 hours they were processed. Pedestrian crossing west was open. They would come into the United States. There would be a relative or family that would assume financial responsibility for them. They were given a parole, a 2-year permit, and then they disappeared into the United States. That's one way of handling it, but I think it's a good way of handling it because you haven't seen that issue emerge again. So I want to thank our witnesses today for being here. I hope you educate us into the specifics, the details of CBP One and how this has become part of your toolkit, your tool chest to address the challenges that you have at our border. Mr. Chairman, I yield.  Statement of Ranking Member J. Luis Correa March 21, 2024 While I am encouraged by innovations like CBP One, we must recognize that these challenges extend well beyond our borders. It is not enough to look at how we are processing people who lawfully travel to ports of entry and request protection. We need to look at how the administration is addressing migration in the region before people ever reach our borders. That's why I'm glad that the State Department could join us today. We are witnessing a world-wide migration challenge coupled with an outdated and under-resourced immigration system. Only Congress can truly fix this for good by expanding legal pathways, investing in the asylum system, and providing the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, and the Department of Justice with adequate funding and resources. Sadly, we have not gotten to that point. Instead, the administration is being innovative with the resources and authorities they already have. There's more Congress can and must do to support border security efforts. For example, next week, Congressman Luttrell and I will be introducing the Emerging Innovative Border Technologies Act, which would require DHS to identify, integrate, and deploy cutting-edge commercial technologies to improve border security operations and better respond to life-threatening situations. I'm proud that we've been able to work across the aisle to improve border security in this way. I am happy to speak with any of my colleagues about this bipartisan piece of legislation. But we should also support the administration when it innovates with the tools it already has to improve operations at the border. CBP One is a great example of this. For years, both Democratic and Republican administrations have encouraged migrants go to ports of entry to ask for protection. This is allowed under our immigration laws. CBP One encourages migrants to not only go to ports of entry, but also to wait for appointments when CBP is prepared to process them. While there aren't enough appointments available to meet the demand, people prefer using a lawful avenue to request protection when it is a realistic option. CBP One isn't perfect. It's just a scheduling tool that helps CBP facilitate more efficient, safe, and fair migrant processing at ports of entry. CBP One simply allows someone to request an appointment at a port of entry. CBP One is not a waiver to walk into the United States without vetting. The app does not grant legal status or adjudicate asylum claims. And to be clear--under our laws, migrants have always been able to approach ports of entry to ask for protection. The CBP One app just makes this more efficient and allows CBP to collect advance information on the people presenting for an appointment. But CBP One addresses such a small part of the challenge before us. We should look broader. As I have said before, we need to continue partnering with our friends to the south, north, and across the globe to address the historic displacement of people world-wide. Shared challenges require shared solutions--this migration crisis affects more than just the United States. That's why, last summer, Chairman Higgins and I introduced the Cooperation on Combatting Human Smuggling and Trafficking Act to enhance partnerships with Mexican, Central American, and South American law enforcement to disrupt human smuggling and human trafficking in the region. The Biden administration has also taken significant steps to develop comprehensive relationships with other countries through multilateral agreements and cooperative action. The Department of State has developed Safe Mobility Offices, also known as regional processing centers, to share information with refugees and vulnerable migrants about safe and lawful pathways for immigration to the United States, Canada, and Spain. The administration has strategically located the safe mobility offices in partner countries in Latin America along migration routes--such as in Colombia, which has received millions of asylum seekers fleeing totalitarianism in Venezuela. When people have a lawful pathway to the United States, they don't need to pay smugglers for their journey. But even these positive steps are not enough. It is up to Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform and approve necessary border security funding. If my colleagues genuinely believe that what is happening at the border is a national security challenge and humanitarian crisis, they should work with us to provide DHS with the necessary resources. Last, I want to thank our witnesses for their public service. I look forward to hearing your testimony about the work your respective agencies are doing to manage the challenges at the border in a humane and orderly way. Mr. Higgins. Thank you, Ranking Member Correa. I now recognize the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations, and Accountability, the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Bishop, for his opening statement. Mr. Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, I think I'll remark, as I open my statement, that I always appreciate the Ranking Member from California and the collegial tone of his remarks. I will say that I am going to articulate a point of view that, very respectfully, takes a different view than the comments he just offered in his opening statement. It is true that there is a lot of migration in the world today. A lot of that is the product of a destabilized world that results from the absence of strong leadership in the White House of the United States and grievous errors in judgment across the globe. But the inception of the dramatic change in our border security is extremely clear as to causation. It occurred immediately after the election, in the run-up to the inauguration, and ballooned into a historic disaster that continues now 4 years later in increasing proportions because of dramatic, 180-degree reversals of policy of administration of the border. If you are concerned about a crisis, at long last, the very last thing that you can do to solve the crisis is to disregard what you did to cause it in the first place. We have had many, many hearings on the global picture with respect to border security, and I know that there are differences on the respective sides of the aisle, and I have great respect for my colleagues. But the evidence is clear. Frankly, the American people understand the evidence because they are living it in every community. The snapshot on the situation today is one little part that has extraordinary significance in itself, but it is just one piece, the CBP One mobile application, something that sounds very hip and modern. We created an app. We gave it a catchy name. But what lies behind the app is the same sort of abuse of power, Executive power to make things up that are not in the law and to use it and to give it a role in facilitating mass illegal immigration into the United States. Since January 2023, the Department of Homeland Security has expanded the use of the CBP One application in two ways. Specifically, to implement a purposeful and determined open borders agenda. First, inadmissible aliens located in Mexico can use the CBP One app to schedule appointments at the Southwest Border. Just schedule an appointment like you're going to visit the doctor. Second, inadmissible aliens--this is one we've revealed the most about lately. It's been out there for a while, but the scale of it is becoming clear. Inadmissible aliens from certain countries like Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela, and Nicaragua who participate in the Department's parole programs that abuse the limits of the Secretary's parole authority can use the CBP One app to request permission to fly from the city of origin right into cities throughout the United States, into U.S. airports. Let's hear the numbers. Let's hear them. The numbers, you hear people tell them. They vary slightly, but this is essentially the numbers. To date, more than 459,000 CBP One appointments have been scheduled at the Southwest Border ports of entry. In 2023 alone, more than 320,000 inadmissible aliens flew into U.S. airports through so-called parole programs using CBP One. These numbers do not even count toward the over 2.8 million aliens crossing our borders illegally Nation-wide since January 2023, which was the date of the beginning of the use of CBP One for this human moving thing, as opposed to the commercial purpose it was originally designed for. The aliens using CBP One aren't just getting appointments, and they are not just hopping on flights. They are also nearly categorically being released into the United States. According to the Department's own data, from January through September 2023, 96 percent, Mr. Higgins said it, of aliens with CBP One appointments at the Southwest Border were released. The probability of release is just as assured as for those flying into airports. From January through June 2023, 97 percent of aliens who flew into a U.S. airport were paroled into the United States. You've heard the saying. Every State is a border State. Now you understand exactly--another dimension why. This is astonishing, considering that the Department recently admitted in litigation that allowing these aliens to fly into U.S. airports creates ``operational vulnerabilities that could be exploited by bad actors''. The administration claims that the use of the CBP One app will slow the flow of aliens illegally entering the United States and cut cartels out of the migration process. I remember when Secretary Mayorkas came and made that very claim. We're going to see--in fact, he was a little smug the first time he appeared to say it. The number soon overwhelmed all the circumstances again, and it didn't even last for long. So those claims belie the facts--or excuse me. The facts belie those claims. Since the CBP One expansion in January 2023, encounters of illegal aliens have reached monthly all-time highs, even well beyond the historic highs that began with the inauguration of the Biden administration and are on pace to reach 2 million again this fiscal year. Meanwhile, cartels are still in firm control of the migration process across the American border. They control the smuggling routes that aliens use to get to Mexico. They actively exploit security loopholes in CBP One to schedule appointments at the border. They clearly still control the Southwest Border, and they continue to make the U.S. Government the logistics arm of the international drug cartels. Alarmingly, data from the Department shows that aliens that make it to Mexico to schedule CBP One appointments at the Southwest Border come from what the FBI considers special interest countries, including Russia, China, and Iran. Despite the Department's claim that inadmissible aliens are thoroughly screened and vetted, we know that the process is inadequate. If an alien has a criminal record in his country of origin, CBP has almost no way of knowing how many of the approximately 750,000 aliens that have been released into this country under the administration's expansion of the CBP One app have gone on to commit acts of violence against Americans. The country has witnessed the tragic results of these programs in the recent rape of a 15-year-old child in Massachusetts by a Haitian allowed into the United States through the CHNV program. The American people deserve robust screening and vetting processes for all perspective entrants. They deserve a secure border, and they deserve a Federal Government that upholds its fundamental duty to honor the law and to protect the safety and security of the American people. With the expansion of CBP One, however, I know that the administration, once again, intends on only managing the public perception of illegal immigration instead of actually securing the border. I want to thank these witnesses for being here and to take our questions. I look forward to their testimony. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.  Statement of Chairman Dan Bishop March 21, 2024 Good afternoon, and welcome to this joint hearing of the Subcommittee on Border Security and Enforcement and the Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations, and Accountability. Today's hearing will examine the Department of Homeland Security's expansion of the CBP One mobile application and its role in facilitating mass illegal immigration into the United States. Since January 2023, the Department of Homeland Security has expanded the use of the CBP One application in two ways to implement its open borders agenda. First, inadmissible aliens located in Mexico can use CBP One to schedule appointments at the Southwest Border. Second, inadmissible aliens from certain countries like Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, who participate in the Department's abuse of parole programs, can use CBP One to request permission to fly into U.S. airports. To date, more than 459,000 CBP One appointments have been scheduled at the Southwest Border ports of entry. In 2023 alone, more than 320,000 inadmissible aliens flew into U.S. airports through parole programs using CBP One. These numbers don't even count toward the over 2.8 million aliens crossing our borders illegally Nation-wide since January 2023. The aliens using CBP One aren't just getting appointments or hopping on flights, they're also nearly categorically being released into the United States.

The administration claims that the use of the CBP One app will slow the flow of aliens illegally entering the United States and cut cartels out of the migration process. But the facts bely these claims. Since the CBP One expansion in January 2023, encounters of illegal aliens have reached monthly all- time highs and are on pace to reach 2 million again this fiscal year. Meanwhile, cartels still control the migration process. They control the smuggling routes that aliens use to get to Mexico, they actively exploiting security loopholes through CBP One, and they clearly still control the Southwest Border. This expanded CBP One use is not a solution to the border crisis; it is a desperate attempt to solve the administration's political crisis and manage the optics of a chaotic border by streamlining catch-and-release policies. It is open borders with the option to check in through a mobile app on a smartphone. Alarmingly, data from the Department shows that aliens that make it to Mexico to schedule CBP One appointments at the Southwest Border come from what the FBI considers special interest countries, including Russia, China, and Iran. Despite the Department's claim that inadmissible aliens are thoroughly screened and vetted, we know that the process is inadequate. If an alien has a criminal record in his country of origin, CBP has almost no way of knowing. How many of the approximately 750,000 aliens that have been released into the country under this administration's expansion of the CBP One app have gone on to commit acts of violence against Americans? The country has witnessed the tragic results of these programs with the recent rape of a 15-year-old child in Massachusetts by a Haitian allowed into the United States through the CHNV program. The American people deserve robust screening and vetting processes for all prospective entrants, they deserve a secure border, and they deserve a Federal Government that upholds its fundamental duty to protect the safety and security of the American people. With the expansion of CBP One, however, I fear that the administration once again intends on only managing the public perception of illegal immigration instead of actually securing the border. I want to thank our witnesses for being here today, and I look forward to their testimony. Mr. Higgins. Thank you, Chairman Bishop. I now recognize the Ranking Member for the Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations, and Accountability, the gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Ivey, for his opening statement. Mr. Ivey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that. I want to thank the witnesses for appearing today. I also want to welcome Congressman Suozzi, our newest Member. I want to thank the New York voters for sending you here. I want to note, too, and you'll have a chance to speak about this more, that, you know, what you just said a moment ago, that the American people have a particular view about this. But the Congressman campaigned on trying to find bipartisan solutions to the immigration issue, to the border crisis, as you call it. The voters picked him, I think, in large part because of that. So congratulations and we welcome your insight. You've got previous experience as a Member, too. You've got more experience than I do as a Member, so welcome to the committee. I was hoping this first hearing was going to be on the exact issue that he ran on, which was fixing the crisis at the border. I was hoping that one of those fixes we could make would be considering the bipartisan Senate bill that took a comprehensive look at how to fix it. Whether you like everything in the bill or not isn't really the issue. The hope I had was that we could at least take it up. We could have amendments and debates and the like. You know, if we had to add something or take something, that's fine. But let's try and find a bipartisan solution to this issue. Unfortunately, that's not where we seem to be going right now. I think our recent history, you know, just before you got here, this committee spent months on the illegitimate impeachment of the Secretary, Mr. Mayorkas. We had hearing after hearing after hearing. The committee generated--the Republican staff generated, I don't know, several hundred pages of allegations and this and that. They swore up and down that they had to impeach him because that's what they needed to do to fix the problem at the border, and we told them at the time, (A), it was unconstitutional and illegitimate because they didn't even come close to meeting the standard of high crimes and misdemeanors. So they had to kind- of fabricate standards. But, more importantly, it wouldn't change anything of what's going on day-to-day on the ground down there. What we told them at the time, and I'm continuing to say that today, is we need to definitely add more resources at the border. I'll be asking you questions about that when the time comes up. But the Senate bill would have added 200 CBP officers, increased the number of USCIS officers examining asylum claims by 800. We've got a supplemental proposal from the White House that we didn't really do much with. I know we've gotten testimony not only from, you know, witnesses at this table, but when we went to the border down in Texas, what was that, a few months ago, and had a chance to speak to them directly, they said we need more resources. We need more people down here. You know, we've got one guy covering X hundred miles of border. We've got people burning out. We've got people leaving because this is damaging to their families. They are relocating people to, you know, different places and the like, and they just don't have enough bodies to do it. I know there's been some conversations and, you know, even some hearings about adding numbers to that, but, you know, we're struggling to get there. Hopefully, the bill that's coming through, the minibus, I guess we're calling it, will help to address this in an immediate way. But we're still, you know, kind-of dragging our feet on that because we're focusing on the small issues instead of the big issues like that one. I also think, too, that the messages aren't just coming from Democrats. They're coming from the Supreme Court. Justice Kavanaugh--and, you know, I quoted this, his language and his opinion multiple times, not only in this committee but on the floor. But one of the things that Justice Kavanaugh wrote in United States v. Texas, which struck down or threw out one of the cases that Texas brought on this issue, and I'll do it from memory I guess at this point, you know, for the past 27 years and 5 presidencies, you know, these policies have been in place, the prosecutorial discretion policies, because they just don't have enough resources to hold everybody. So whoever is in charge has to make a decision about who gets released and who doesn't. Now, they complain about who gets released, and they will pull up cases about somebody gets released and does something bad and, you know, fair enough. But the only way to fix it is to put more resources and expand the number of people who can address the problem. That would include, for example, judges, dramatically increasing the number of judges who can hear these cases so it doesn't take 6 or 7 years. Maybe take 6 or 7 months. If we start turning people back quicker, then that might be one way to address this problem, too, and send the message back that you don't just get to come here and stay for 6 years. But we haven't made much headway on that with my colleagues on the other side either. I just want to make this--read this comment from Senator Lankford. He's one of the individuals who led the crafting of the bipartisan Senate bill. He's a Republican from Oklahoma and had been viewed as a very conservative member up until he came out with this bill. Former President Trump sort-of vilified him for that. You know, the Speaker and some of the House Republican colleagues got in step with that. But here's what he said: Welcome to governance. You can do a partisan bill in the House. But in the Senate, we have to look at each other across the aisle and then figure out a way to be able to solve this. So I'm hoping that we can prove him wrong at some point, that we will get to a point here in the House where we decide we really want to try and do something and solve this. I know we've had bills considered here in the committee before. My recollection from one of those markups was I think every amendment the Democrats offered was rejected on a party line vote, if I recall correctly. I think you might have got something done on the floor, but other than that. Then during the impeachment hearing, they rejected all of the amendments on the party line vote up until they got tired of hearing them. Then they just summarily dismissed like 30 of the amendments. We didn't have a chance to vote on them. So I'm hoping we can move away from that approach and get to the point where we're actually considering trying to work together. I feel like I've been able to do that with some of my colleagues on the other side. Congressman Bishop, I think we've been able to do hearings together in a way that's been, in my view, bipartisan. We've been able to, you know, address those issues. We don't agree on everything but at least we hash it out. I'm hoping that we can get there on this issue, too, because it's too important to the American people to just keep letting it drift off and, you know, for these political reasons. So with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Higgins. Thank you, Ranking Member Ivey. I now recognize the Chairman of the whole committee, the Committee on Homeland Security, Chairman Green, for his opening statement. Chairman Green. Thank you, Chairman. I appreciate you letting me sit in on your committee, both of you. And the Ranking Members, I appreciate them. I have deep respect for all of the folks who sit on this committee on both sides of the aisle. A lot of long nights have happened, mark-ups. We've got a mark-up coming up here pretty soon that should be a little easier with some bills from both sides. But I do want to take issue, though, with some of the things that have been said today. This notion about a historic migration crisis. I tend to agree with Mr. Bishop. You can trace the causation of this. There's a massive shift in policy. There have been no significant increase in weather events in Latin America. Their GDP has actually increased, so you can blame COVID if you want to, but since COVID, their GDPs have all gone up. It's not an issue of COVID causing the issue, certainly not now. It really pushes reason to suggest that it's not--because we just completely did away with any constraints and created incredible incentives. If you come, you just get released into the country. People tested the system. They called home and mass waves came. It's quite simple. I mean, if it was an asylum issue, you get out of your country. You're in the next country. You're safe. But they don't do that. They keep coming. It's not that issue. It's not an issue of just Latin America. I mean, we're talking 160 countries encountered at the Southwest Border. The notion that it might be because people have different color skin, that's just crazy, because when I was there, there were a huge group of Russians coming through. It's funny. We want to block Russians from going into Ukraine, but we seem to want to welcome them into the United States if they fill out the CBP app. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to 80 percent of the Americans, too, if you poll them right now. In terms of the conduct of the committee recently and whether or not we should have impeached our first sitting Cabinet Secretary in the history of the country, you know, I've made my position very clear on this. The law is the law. The Constitution is the Constitution. The Constitution says Congress writes the laws and the Executive branch executes them. You can look at all the previous impeachments in the past. Every single one of them basically made the argument that the Executive branch didn't get to pick which ones they wanted to enforce and which ones they didn't. That brings us to this discussion about CBP One. This thing was designed for Customs, to get trade-in. I love Mr. Correa's comments on this. He's been really on top of how we need to facilitate the trade. I appreciate, in previous committee hearings, how you've really pushed that issue, and I liked CBP One for that. But making it a blanket automatic parole is against the law. Shall detain. That's what the law says. It's interesting. The law doesn't say to DAs across the country, you shall capture every murderer, but it does say you shall detain everybody who comes in that has a felony conviction. Mr. Mayorkas was very clear. No, you don't have to do that, employees of DHS, despite what the law says. We can't have Cabinet Secretaries who just get to make it up on their own. That's not what the Constitution--our founders, they spread power out and that's how we get freedom. But a rogue Cabinet Secretary who just gets to make up and do whatever he wants because he doesn't like the current system, that's just not how the Constitution is set up. So should we pass some laws and fix these issues? Yes, we should. I would love to fix immigration law. The problem is we've got an unsecure border. It's like an arterial bleed. Nine million people. I mean, just think of the teachers we've had to add in the country, if we want a 35-to-1 ratio, that's about 15,000 teachers for this number of kids that have come in. Where are we going to get those in the blink of an eye? It's untenable. Of course, the crime and stuff that's associated with it when the cartels take advantage of this mass migration wave created by the change and the paradigm shift, that's the reason for it. So I think getting to the bottom of just how the CBP One app is being used is very important. I think it's critical, actually, because these particularly special privileges being provided to countries without there being any law passed on that needs to be deeply delved into. I appreciate both Chairmen for putting this committee hearing together, and I look forward to hearing from our witnesses. I yield.  Statement of Chairman Mark E. Green, MD March 21, 2024 I would like to first thank Chairman Higgins and Chairman Bishop for holding this important hearing, today. The Department of Homeland Security's unlawful use of the CBP One app to mass-parole hundreds of thousands of inadmissible aliens into the United States has now magnified the serious nature of President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas' self-imposed border crisis. Rather than instructing the Department of Homeland Security to deter illegal immigration and foreign threats abroad, Secretary Mayorkas has created incentives to invite them in. I hope that today's hearing will shed light on the administration's true intent for the CBP One app--which is to grant just about anyone in the world parole into the United States. The original purpose of the app under President Trump was to streamline the flow of legal commercial cargo for legitimate trade. However, under Secretary Mayorkas, it has become a means to streamline mass migration for mostly inadmissible aliens. This expansion of the radical, open-borders agenda provides just about any foreign national, including inadmissible aliens without proper documents, almost guaranteed parole. The Biden administration has made it crystal clear that they want them here and they are using CBP One for this purpose. While the administration touts their immigration policies as being ``safe and humane'' for migrants, they are forgetting that their duty is to protect Americans and prioritize homeland security above all else. I am confident that this committee will not let this administration forget that. Even more startling is that in January alone, the Department of Homeland Security processed over 45,000 inadmissible aliens into the country using the CBP One app. Not to mention that between January 2023 and the end of January 2024, approximately half-a-million inadmissible aliens ``successfully scheduled appointments'' with Customs and Border Protection. Of the half a million--how many were paroled into our country? Which leads us to question the Department's rampant misuse of parole. By law, parole should only be used on a case-by-case basis. The Secretary's use of parole is a perfect illustration of the abuse of authority that this administration is trying to get away with. Secretary Mayorkas has taken his ill-conceived interpretation of parole and has perverted it to accelerate the mass entry of aliens through his Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan, or CHNV, and Family Reunification parole programs. Thousands of foreign nationals are receiving pre-authorized travel from abroad to arrive at any U.S. airport of their choosing. Why is Secretary Mayorkas flying inadmissible aliens in? Make no mistake, this was by design. Well, I've got news for you. The committee is watching. America is watching. Secretary Mayorkas' illegal use of CBP One to undermine our border and facilitate chaos is nothing more than a smoke screen. Under the guise of ``law and order,'' the Department is using CBP One to simply shuffle illegal aliens through the Southwest Border and disguising these unlawful border crossings as legal entries. As the committee seeks to gain insight about CBP One's expansion, its intended purpose, and capabilities, from the witnesses before us here today, I would like to ask everyone in the room to think about this: Who is ultimately benefiting from this app? The migrants? The cartels? And does this make us safer? The answer is clearly ``no.'' The administration's utter refusal to secure our borders is once again on full display. With that, I yield back the balance of my time and look forward to hearing from our witnesses. Mr. Higgins. The gentleman yields. Other Members of the committee are reminded that opening statements may be submitted for the record.  Statement of Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson March 21, 2024 I am pleased the subcommittees are examining the Biden-Harris administration's efforts to address increased rates of migration to the U.S. Southwest Border in a humane and effective way. We are currently seeing increased rates of migration across the world, with the United States and our neighbors being no exception. However, the solution to this challenge is not to repeat the cruel policies of the Trump administration, which oversaw the separation of families at the border and limited legal immigration pathways, leaving vulnerable populations in danger. Instead, President Biden has taken a proactive approach to combatting the root causes of migration in the Western Hemisphere while ensuring that there is an orderly and safe process for those who are making their case for admission under our laws. The administration has worked to foster cooperative agreements with regional partners in the Western Hemisphere to address the political, economic, security, and environmental conditions that lead to irregular migration. This increased collaboration with Mexico and other countries in Central and South America helps the United States provide accurate information for those considering making the dangerous journey north and instead encourage the use of legal immigration pathways. One of the key components of the Department of Homeland Security's efforts to incentivize noncitizens to use lawful and safe pathways is the CBP One app. This app allows migrants to schedule an appointment to present themselves at a port of entry, preventing the kind of chaos and dysfunction at the border seen during the Trump administration. Over the last year, more than 450,000 individuals have successfully used the app to schedule appointments at ports of entry, which creates an orderly and humane process for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to address those who seek entry into the country. The app has also been used to facilitate humanitarian parole programs for those fleeing emergency situations in their home countries of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. These are the same types of parole programs prior administrations have used, which have proven to be effective in reducing the number of migrants seeking to cross between ports of entry. The CBP One app is not a rubber stamp to any noncitizen that seeks entry; it merely serves as a scheduling tool, providing logistical support for migrants and CBP alike. Those who use it are still subject to the same screening and vetting that CBP uses to evaluate anyone else seeking entry into the country. But the orderly processing helps ease the burden on often overworked CBP Officers and Border Patrol Agents and maximize CBP resources. The success of the app demonstrates that most migrants will use safe, orderly, and humane pathways to make their case for admittance into the United States if given the option, rather than trying to cross illegally. CBP continues to work on improvements to the app, addressing any security vulnerabilities and ensuring that migrants who have been trying to obtain appointments for the longest time will be prioritized. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about how this committee can support the administration's efforts to address migration challenges with legal pathways, technological solutions, and international collaboration. Mr. Higgins. I'm pleased to welcome our panel of witnesses. I, again, apologize that there was delay getting started, but we appreciate your patience. I ask that our witnesses please rise and raise your right hand.  Mr. Higgins. Let the record reflect that the witnesses have answered in the affirmative. Thank you all. Please be seated. I would like to now formally introduce our witnesses. Mr. Adam Hunter is the deputy assistant secretary for immigration policy at the Department of Homeland Security. He was appointed on January 20, 2021. Mr. Hunter has more than 15 years experience in migration, national security, and international affairs issues. Before assuming his role at DHS, he was the executive director of Refugee Council USA, an organization working to protect and welcome refugees, asylum seekers, and other forcibly displaced populations. During a previous tenure in government, Mr. Hunter served as acting chief of staff at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and held other agency leadership and program management roles. Our next witness is Ms. Diane Sabatino. She's the acting executive assistant commissioner of the Office of Field Operations within the United States Customs and Border Protection. As the senior official for the Office of Field Operations, Ms. Sabatino is responsible for overseeing the operations of 20 major field offices, 328 ports of entry, and over 70 locations in over 40 countries internationally. She leads more than 32,000 employees and oversees an annual operating budget of $7.5 billion. Ms. Sabatino previously served as a deputy executive assistant commissioner in the Office of Field Operations. Our next witness is Ms. Tammy Meckley. She is the associate director for Immigration Records and Identity Services Directorate at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Ms. Meckley began her role as associate director in February 2015. In this role, she manages the e-verify and Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, the SAVE program. She oversees the largest FOIA program in the Federal Government and leads USCIS' e-processing initiative, which connects previously separate technology systems within the agency to improve decision timeliness, increase transparency during the application process, and accelerate the availability of on-line filing for all immigration benefits. Our next witness is Ms. Marta Youth. She is the principal deputy assistant secretary for the Department of State's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration. She joined the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration as a deputy assistant secretary in November 2020. Ms. Youth oversees the Office of the Executive Director, the Office of International Migration, and the Office of Assistance for Western Hemisphere. Ms. Youth was previously the director of Central American affairs and the Bureau of Western Hemisphere affairs. Ms. Youth has been a foreign service officer for more than 25 years and is a member of the senior foreign service. I thank the witnesses for being here today. The witnesses' full statements will appear in the record. I now recognize Mr. Hunter for 5 minutes to summarize his opening statement. STATEMENT OF ADAM HUNTER, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR IMMIGRATION POLICY, OFFICE OF STRATEGY, POLICY, AND PLANS, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY Mr. Hunter. Thank you, Chairman Higgins, Ranking Member Correa, Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Ivey, and Chairman Green. I appreciate the opportunity to be here and discuss the Department of Homeland Security's efforts to carry out its statutory border security enforcement missions. At our Southwest Border, we continue to experience the impacts of global trends that have been building for many years. Violence, food insecurity, severe poverty, corruption, climate change, and, more recently, the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic have all contributed to a significant increase in displacement around the world. These conditions drive unprecedented movements of people in our own hemisphere, too, where failing authoritarian regimes in Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, along with a worsening security in humanitarian crisis in Haiti, exacerbate conditions, and smugglers and cartels are all too eager to put migrants' lives at risk for profit. You will hear more from my State Department colleague about these drivers, as well as the administration's comprehensive hemispheric approach to reduce irregular migration in collaboration with partner governments in the region. For DHS's part, we execute upon a two-part strategy to reduce irregular migration by strengthening consequences for individuals who cross the border unlawfully while also expanding lawful pathways and processes to incentivize use of safe and orderly alternatives to irregular migration. From our enhanced use of expedited removal, our increased removals and returns of individuals without a legal basis to remain in the country, to the circumvention of lawful pathways rule and other efforts, we are imposing serious consequences for unlawful entry. Through the expansion of lawful pathways and processes, including the CHNV parole processes and scheduling through the CBP One app at the border, we provide alternatives to irregular migration. Taken together, DHS has changed the calculus for migrants and further disincentivize the irregular journey, which often includes putting their lives in the hands of smugglers. Our efforts have yielded positive results. Between returning to full Title 8 processing enforcement on May 12, 2023, to now, DHS has removed or returned more than 630,000 individuals, the vast majority of whom crossed the Southwest Border. Put another way, our removals and returns over the last 10- month period alone exceeds each and every full fiscal year total going back to 2013. Border encounters are also lower this quarter with encounters of Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan nationals all notably below their peaks. Consequences are, however, not sufficient to deter irregular migration alone. To be most effective, the consequences we enforce must be paired with incentives for migrants to use safe, orderly, and lawful processes. The CBP One application specifically was first deployed in October 2020. Over time, new functionalities have been added. The app itself is not a pathway. Rather, it is an operational tool that supports CBP processes and services. The CBP One functionality used by noncitizens along the Southwest Border is limited to a scheduling function of an appointment. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, codified under Title 8 of the U.S. Code, the Department is required to inspect noncitizens who present at a port of entry within the United States. The app is, therefore, for us an important tool for managing the border, more efficiently processing those who present, and safely and orderly carrying out DHS's responsibilities under law. By allowing individuals to directly schedule an appointment from central to northern Mexico, the CBP One app effectively cuts out smugglers, decreases migrant exploitation, and improves safety and security. More than 500,000 noncitizens have successfully scheduled an appointment. As my colleague from U.S. Customs and Border Protection will discuss, CBP's inspection, screening and vetting, processing at ports, and releases on parole from our custody have occurred under prior administrations and exist under our existing Title 8 authorities. DHS continues to deliver strength and consequences for noncitizens who do not establish a lawful basis to remain in the United States, while simultaneously offering safe and orderly processes for noncitizens at our ports of entry. I'm proud to work alongside the dedicated 260,000 employees who make up DHS throughout its headquarters and operational components. The Department remains eager to work with this committee and other Congressional leaders on a bipartisan basis to update the United States' framework and provide for durable solutions. In the mean time, DHS will utilize every tool currently at its disposal and within its authority to security the border and create a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system. Thank you for the opportunity to testify. I look forward to your questions.  Prepared Statement of Adam Hunter March 21, 2024 introduction Chairman Higgins, Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Correa, and Ranking Member Ivey, and distinguished Members of the subcommittees: I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS or Department) efforts to carry out its statutory border security and enforcement mission, including by efficiently inspecting, vetting, and processing noncitizens who present for admission at Southwest Border ports of entry (POE). I have served the Department as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Immigration Policy since January 20, 2021. I am proud to work alongside the 260,000 employees who make up DHS, including those represented by leadership from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) here today. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, as codified under Title 8 of the U.S. Code, the Department is required to inspect noncitizens who present at a POE within the United States seeking admission into the country. Those inspections, as well as the processing decisions that flow from them, are executed under Title 8 authorities. As a law enforcement agency, DHS follows the law. In full recognition of the requirement to inspect and process individuals under Title 8, and in furtherance of its mission to secure the Nation's borders, even as historically high migrant arrivals have overstretched DHS's limited resources, DHS has taken innovative steps to disincentivize irregular migration and minimize the risk of human smuggling. Core to these efforts is a two-part strategy to simultaneously (1) expand the availability of safe, orderly, and lawful pathways and processes to come to the United States, and (2) strictly enforce our Nation's immigration laws by imposing consequences on individuals who do not avail themselves of safe, orderly, and lawful pathways and processes. These tandem efforts increase security and better utilize limited law enforcement resources. global trends There are more people displaced throughout the world today than at any time since World War II. Violence, food insecurity, severe poverty, corruption, climate change, the fall-out of the COVID-19 pandemic, and dire economic conditions have all contributed to a significant increase in irregular migration around the globe. In the Western Hemisphere, failing authoritarian regimes in Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua, along with an on-going security and humanitarian crisis in Haiti, have driven millions of people from those countries to leave their homes; further, these countries' uncooperative governments or unstable reception conditions make it difficult to impose enforcement consequences on unlawful entry due to the severe restrictions we have on our ability to return their nationals. Increased encounters at our border are a direct result of global trends that have been building for many years. Historically, encounters along the Southwest Border in the 1980's and 1990's consisted overwhelmingly of single adults from Mexico who were migrating for economic reasons and regularly crossed back and forth across the border. Until the early 2000's, encounters routinely numbered more than 1 million a year. In the early 2010's, following 3 decades of bipartisan border security investments, encounters reached modern lows, averaging fewer than 400,000 per year from 2011 to 2017. However, even during this period, DHS faced significant situational surges in migration by, for example, unaccompanied children in 2014, and family units in 2016. Between 2017 and 2019 alone, encounters along the Southwest Border more than doubled, and--following a significant drop during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, which shut down cross- border movements around the world and depressed global migration-- encounters continued to increase in 2021, 2022, and 2023. dhs efforts In response to these global migration trends, DHS has taken a number of innovative steps that seek to change the calculus for intending migrants, including before they even begin an irregular migration journey. These measures include strengthened consequences for individuals who cross the border unlawfully, while significantly expanding lawful pathways to incentivize noncitizens to use safe and orderly processes to come to the United States without having to put their lives in the hands of smugglers for an arduous and dangerous irregular journey. These efforts and others have collectively yielded results: since the expiration of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) public health order under Title 42 on May 12, 2023, to March 6, 2024, DHS removed or returned nearly 600,000 individuals, the vast majority having recently crossed the Southwest Border. Nearly 100,000 of those removed or returned were traveling in family units. The majority of all individuals DHS encountered along the Southwest Border over the past 3 years were removed, returned, or expelled. In just the past 10 months alone, DHS has exceeded the full-year total number of individuals removed and returned during each fiscal year since 2013. The CBP One mobile application was deployed in October 2020 to serve as a single portal to a variety of CBP services, with early functionality supporting trade and cargo facilitation. As functionality has been added, the CBP One mobile application provides increased accessibility to some of CBP's most utilized services. The CBP One mobile application has been key to supporting several of the Department's efforts to incentivize use of lawful pathways and processes. However, the mobile application itself is not a lawful pathway; rather it is a technological tool that supports CBP processes. The CBP One functionality used by noncitizens along the Southwest Border is limited to scheduling an appointment to present at 1 of 8 designated POEs. Unlike the supporter-initiated parole processes, a noncitizen can schedule an appointment on their own, and seek to present oneself for inspection at a land POE. This scheduling function--announced as part of new border enforcement measures on January 5, 2023--is an important tool to maintain a safe and orderly process for managing the border and more efficiently processing those who present at a POE, consistent with CBP and the Department's statutory responsibilities. Prior to this, similar CBP One scheduling functionality was utilized for noncitizens seeking a humanitarian exception from the CDC's public health order under Title 42 of the U.S. Code. Upon expiration of that public health order, DHS resumed processing all noncitizens presenting for admission at a POE under Title 8 authorities. As noted earlier, Title 8 requires DHS personnel to inspect noncitizens who present at a POE within the United States seeking admission into the country. The scheduling function was expanded to provide a mechanism in which any noncitizen located in Central and Northern Mexico could seek to schedule an appointment to present at a POE at a pre-scheduled time. This allows migrants to avoid needing to congregate at or near POEs for hours or days on end, and allows DHS to more efficiently prepare for the orderly processing of arriving migrants. Importantly, CBP One is used only as a scheduling tool. The application is not a tool to request parole. It is not a tool to claim asylum, nor is it used to screen, inspect, or process noncitizens for entry to the United States. The tool simply allows individuals of any nationality who are in Central or Northern Mexico to schedule an appointment to present themselves at a designated land POE. The advance biographic and biometric information individuals provide in CBP One to secure their appointment allows CBP to streamline its screening and vetting processes at the border. The efficiency gained by noncitizens' use of the CBP One scheduling function has allowed CBP to significantly expand its capacity to process noncitizens more efficiently at land POEs on the Southwest Border compared to pre-pandemic processing. By allowing individuals to directly schedule an appointment, the CBP One app effectively cuts out the smugglers, decreases migrant exploitation, and improves safety and security in addition to making the process more efficient. The tool itself is available in English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole, and CBP has published reference guides in 9 additional languages. Because CBP One is available across Central and Northern Mexico, it removes the need for noncitizens to congregate in and around border towns, where they can often be subject to manipulation by bad actors who seek to exploit them for profit. Transnational criminal organizations encourage and facilitate these migratory flows, spreading disinformation about what individuals will encounter along the route, at our border, and once in the United States, so they can exploit migrants as part of a billion-dollar criminal enterprise. The increasing role that drug cartels are playing in human smuggling throughout the region is particularly concerning given their complete disregard for human life, which has led to tragedies in the United States, Mexico, and many other countries. Since the launch of its scheduling functionality on January 18, 2023, through the end February 2024, more than 501,000 noncitizens have successfully scheduled an appointment to present in a safe and orderly manner at a designated POE through the CBP One app. When a noncitizen presents at a POE within the United States seeking admission into the country, they are inspected and processed by a CBP officer. During inspection, the CBP officer determines an appropriate processing disposition, including but not limited to, initiating removal proceedings by issuing a Notice to Appear before an immigration judge, and considering, on a case-by-case basis, whether to grant parole for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit. When exercising such discretion, the CBP officer considers a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the nature of the noncitizen's inadmissibility, any humanitarian or public interest considerations relevant at the time of inspection, any previous apprehensions, previous grants of discretion, and the noncitizen's intended purpose for seeking entry into the United States. Noncitizens who are determined to pose a national security or public safety threat, or who otherwise do not warrant parole as a matter of officer discretion, will not be authorized a grant of parole and may be detained pending further processing. Such factors are considered both for noncitizens presenting with CBP One appointments at a POE, and for those without a CBP One appointment. These factors and available processing dispositions under our longstanding Title 8 authorities also predate the use of CBP One. CBP One is also used as a second step in the workflow of certain parole processes, like those available to nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela and their immediate family members. For the parole processes, only after a noncitizen's U.S.-based supporter has been confirmed by USCIS would the noncitizen beneficiary receive instructions to submit certain information through the CBP One application to be vetted and considered for travel authorization. If authorized, the beneficiary may travel to an air POE and seek a discretionary grant of parole by CBP on a case-by-case basis. CBP One is just one tool in broader DHS efforts to incentivize migrants to use safe and orderly processes and disincentivize attempts at irregular or unlawful entry to the United States. In addition, DHS has continued to implement the Circumvention of Lawful Pathways rule. Its provisions incentivize migrants to use the lawful, safe, and orderly processes that DHS has established and disincentivize dangerous border crossings by placing a common-sense condition on asylum eligibility for those individuals who fail to do so, and who do not otherwise qualify for an exception. Under the rule, individuals who circumvent the expanded lawful, safe, and orderly pathways or processes into the United States--to include, but not limited to, the use of the CBP One mobile app to schedule a time and place to present at a POE--and also fail to seek protection in a country through which they traveled on their way to the United States, are subject to a rebuttable presumption of asylum ineligibility in the United States unless they meet specified exceptions. Individuals who cannot establish a valid claim to protection under the standards set out in the rule are subject to prompt removal under Title 8 authorities, which carries at least a 5- year bar to admission to the United States and the potential to be criminally prosecuted for repeated unlawful entry. conclusion DHS remains vigilant and will continue to deliver the strengthened consequences that have been put in place at the border for noncitizens who do not establish a lawful basis to remain in the United States, while simultaneously offering safe and orderly processes for noncitizens at our POEs. However, we recognize that the underlying conditions prompting historic migration across the Western Hemisphere remain, and smugglers will continue to weaponize disinformation to put migrants' lives at risk for profit. We have demonstrated our commitment to work innovatively within our statutory authorities, and using the resources made available by Congress, to address the challenges we are facing at our border and in the region. I strongly urge Congress to act on the bipartisan bill that was presented in the Senate. This bill, if passed into law, would be the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the border we've had in decades. It will make our country safer, make our border more secure, and treat people fairly and humanely while preserving legal immigration, consistent with our values as a Nation. It would deliver much-needed resources to support and expand the DHS workforce after decades of chronic underfunding and builds on this administration's approach of applying strengthened consequences for those who cross the border unlawfully, while making available safe and orderly pathways for those who qualify. The Department remains eager to work with this committee and other Congressional leaders, on a bipartisan basis, to update the United States' immigration framework, including by modernizing the asylum system. Until Congress makes changes only Congress can make, DHS will continue to utilize every tool currently at its disposal and within DHS's authorities to secure the border and create a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system. Thank you for the opportunity to testify. I look forward to your questions. Mr. Higgins. Thank you, Mr. Hunter. I now recognize Ms. Sabatino for 5 minutes to summarize her opening statement. STATEMENT OF DIANE J. SABATINO, ACTING EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER, OFFICE OF FIELD OPERATIONS, U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION Ms. Sabatino. Good afternoon, Chairman Higgins, Ranking Member Correa, Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Ivey, and distinguished Members of the subcommittees. It's an honor to testify today and discuss U.S. Customs and Border Protection's use of mobile technology to modernize operations at our ports of entry as part of CBP's critical mission to secure our borders and facilitate lawful travel and trade. I'm proud to represent the more than 32,000 dedicated personnel of CBP's Office of Field Operations, commonly referred to as OFO, who work tirelessly every day across 328 ports of entry to protect our border, our homeland, and our communities. We must balance complex mission sets, including encountering inadmissible persons, facilitating lawful travel and trade, and combating criminal smuggling. Innovative technology has always been a critical aspect of our efforts to increase security, streamline and modernize processes, and improve stakeholder experiences. Since its deployment in October 2020, the CBP One mobile application has served as a single portal to a variety of CBP services. CBP One is a secure and flexible platform that effectively and efficiently supports multiple OFO enforcement processes and stakeholder services as part of our long-standing security and facilitation operations. For instance, the app has a role in the Department of Homeland Security processes, such as for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans, commonly referred to as CHNV. Subsequent to sponsor, screening, and vetting with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, noncitizens may apply for advanced travel authorization from CBP through an automated process and will undergo biometric and biographic screening. The app streamlines this process by performing multiple systems checks, freeing officers from time-consuming manual data entry, and allows officers to focus on their important vetting activities, as well as other mission priorities at ports of entry. All individuals are vetted against law enforcement holdings, which includes the watch list, text, which is a comprehensive records database, travel data, criminal records, NCIC, and information provided by our U.S. Government and international law enforcement partners. The app also provides a scheduling function enabling noncitizens located in central and northern Mexico to submit advance information and make an appointment to present themselves at a specified land border port of entry for inspection and processing. This replaced a manual process that had previously been coordinated with NGO's. The app increases security by enabling the submission of advance information that assists officers in identifying bad actors and preparing questions before an individual arrives at the border. This streamlines the inspection process tying data together, which directly supports our CBP officers during their inspections. Without advance information provided through the app, processing at the Southwest Border ports of entry would divert officers from other mission priorities, like interdicting illicit narcotics, such as fentanyl, conducting important outbound operations, looking for weapons and currency, and processing legitimate trade and travel, which directly supports our economy. The app is a valuable tool for modernizing and improving processes, but in no way does the technology replace the experience and expertise of a CBP officer. On-line citizens who arrive at a port of entry are inspected by a CBP officer. Our officers verify the identity, nationality, citizenship, and stated intent for entry of individuals, review law enforcement systems for prior immigration encounters or criminal history, and interview the individual. The integration of CBP One is part of our comprehensive border management operations, provides the best information possible to our CBP officers, which allows our officers to do what they do best, which is talking to people to determine intent and increase situational awareness. We facilitate the flow of trillions of dollars in legitimate cargo every year while enforcing hundreds of trade laws to protect American businesses and consumers. At the same time, we are facilitating growing volumes of international travel across all of our international operating environments. The efficiencies, such as the collection of advance information, strengthens the security of our borders and enhances our ability to address irregular migration challenges without compromising our missions, including, again, interdicting illicit drugs and facilitating the flow of legitimate trade and travel to ensure continued National and economic security. I appreciate the subcommittee's continued support of our mission, as well as our work force, and I look forward to your questions. Thank you.  Prepared Statement of Diane J. Sabatino March 21, 2024 introduction Chairman Higgins, Ranking Member Correa, Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Ivey, and Members of the subcommittees, thank you for the opportunity to discuss U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) use of mobile technology to support and facilitate inspection and processing operations at U.S. ports of entry (POEs) as part of our critical mission to secure our borders and facilitate lawful trade and travel. I am honored to represent the dedicated men and women of CBP's Office of Field Operations (OFO) who operate on the front lines to ensure our national and economic security. OFO is responsible for securing the Nation's borders while facilitating lawful trade and travel at POEs, which includes the inspection of all arriving noncitizens seeking admission into the United States. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the March 2020 implementation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) public health order,\1\ commonly referred to as the Title 42 Order, transformed the Southwest Border (SWB) environment and significantly altered CBP's operations. From March 20, 2020, at 11:59 p.m. ET, until the order ended at 11:59 p.m. ET on May 11, 2023, with the expiration of the COVID-19 public health emergency, CBP expelled noncitizens subject to the Title 42 Order, which suspended the introduction into the United States of certain noncitizens arriving at land and adjacent coastal borders, to protect against the spread of COVID-19. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ March 20, 2020, CDC Order under Sections 362 & 365 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 265, 268): Order Suspending Introduction of Certain Persons from Countries Where a Communicable Disease Exists. https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/pdf/CDC-Order- Prohibiting-Introduction-of-Persons_Final_3-20-20_3-p.pdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As a critical component of the whole-of-Government planning effort led by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) over 18 months,\2\ CBP made numerous preparations for the end of the Title 42 Order. These measures included, but were not limited to, deployment and development of new technology to improve processing efficiencies and security, and coordination with our Federal, State, local, international, and non- governmental partners. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \2\ This comprehensive approach was outlined in the DHS Plan for Southwest Border Security and Preparedness issued in April 2022 and updated in December 2022. See https://www.dhs.gov/news/2023/05/01/fact- sheet-update-dhs-planning-southwest-border-security-measures-title-42- public. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- After the end of the Title 42 Order, with new resources, technologies, and processes in place, CBP has resumed applying its full range of immigration authorities under Title 8 of the U.S. Code to process all noncitizens encountered at the border, as we have done throughout our agency's history. These authorities provide for meaningful consequences for inadmissible noncitizens, to include placing individuals in expedited removal or other immigration removal proceedings, as well as subjecting individuals to a minimum 5-year bar on reapplying for admission and potential criminal prosecution if they subsequently re-enter without authorization. Since well before the COVID-19 pandemic, OFO had been advancing its use of technology to improve service delivery and customer experience. Prior to the incorporation of technology, many of OFO's inspection and facilitation processes required manually intensive procedures by CBP officers and stakeholders. Processes often required lengthy transaction times to allow officers to manually input data, such as biographical information, carrying an increased risk of data errors, and diverting officers from devoting their time and focus to critical security functions. The development and deployment of innovative technology has always been a critical component of OFO's efforts to increase security, streamline processes, and improve stakeholder experience. CBP continues to invest in technology that standardizes, automates, and enhances manual processes and services by making them more efficient, accurate, and secure. Since its deployment in October 2020, the CBP One mobile application has served as a single portal to a variety of CBP services.\3\ As part of CBP's comprehensive effort to strengthen the security of our Nation's borders while enhancing legitimate trade, CBP One provides increased accessibility to some of CBP's most utilized services and is an important tool to help CBP provide a safe, orderly, and humane mechanism for managing the border. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \3\ https://www.cbp.gov/about/mobile-apps-directory/cbpone. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- For that reason, CBP operationalized technology, specifically the CBP One mobile application, to support its approach to providing certain noncitizens with lawful, safe, orderly options for presenting themselves for inspection at a POE. cbp one as part of cbp's enforcement and processing operations The CBP One application, a secure and flexible platform, enables OFO to effectively and efficiently incorporate multiple enforcement processes and services into our long-standing security and facilitation operations. For example, in April 2022, the administration announced a process known as Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) that provides a pathway for Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members who are outside the United States to come to the United States through an airport POE and stay temporarily in a 2-year period of parole. Ukrainians participating in U4U must have an eligible and verified supporter in the United States who agrees to provide them with financial support for the duration of their stay in the United States. U4U beneficiaries then submit required information to CBP on-line through CBP One. Building on the success of this process, in October 2022, DHS implemented a similar process to allow certain Venezuelan nationals and their immediate family members to request advance authorization to travel to the United States through an airport POE to seek a discretionary grant of parole. Similar processes were initiated in January 2023 for nationals of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Haiti. These four processes together are commonly referred to as ``CHNV.'' The CHNV processes leverage CBP One to collect the required applicant information. Separately from the parole processes described above, CBP One contains a functionality that provides noncitizens physically located in Central or Northern Mexico with the ability to schedule an appointment to present themselves at a land border POE for inspection and processing. This functionality was implemented in January 2023. Available in English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole (in addition to quick reference guides in a dozen languages), CBP One effectively cuts out smugglers, decreases migrant exploitation, and improves safety and security in addition to making the process more efficient. Without the advance information being provided through CBP One, processing at SWB land POEs would take additional time, thus diverting officers from other priorities. Since the CBP One scheduling feature was introduced, more than 530,000 noncitizens have successfully scheduled appointments to present themselves at a SWB land POE.\4\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \4\ As of February 29, 2024. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Prior to the termination of the Title 42 order, the scheduling function was used by noncitizens to schedule an appointment to present at a SWB land POE to seek a humanitarian exception to the Title 42 Order. When the Title 42 Order ended and CBP returned to processing all noncitizens under its long-standing Title 8 authorities, the scheduling capability in the app enabled all noncitizens who have submitted the appropriate information and are within Central or Northern Mexico to request a date and time to present at a designated POE for processing. However, noncitizens are not required to use CBP One to present at a POE for processing, and CBP inspects and processes all noncitizens who arrive at a POE, regardless of whether they use the application to schedule an appointment or submit registration information. Additionally, in May 2023, as part of the Government-wide post- Title 42 strategy to address the anticipated increase in migrants seeking to enter the United States by way of the SWB, DHS and the Department of Justice (DOJ) published a Final Rule \5\ ``Circumvention of Lawful Pathways,'' establishing a rebuttable presumption of asylum ineligibility for certain noncitizens who fail to seek asylum or other protection in a country through which they travel and fail to take advantage of the existing and expanded lawful, safe, and orderly pathways and processes created by this administration, including the opportunity to schedule a time and place to present at a SWB land POE via the CBP One mobile application. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \5\ 88 FR 31314 (published May 16, 2023). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The CBP One application is used in different ways to support various POE processes for travelers and stakeholders. For example, while CBP One includes functionality for those seeking to schedule an appointment to present at a land POE along the SWB, it has a separate and distinct functionality used by those seeking to request advance authorization to travel as part of established DHS parole processes, such as the U4U and CHNV processes. Noncitizens who are seeking to travel to the United States through the U4U or CHNV processes are required to have a U.S.-based supporter in the United States, who must first submit an affidavit of support with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and undergo required vetting. Following this review, if the supporter is verified, the intending beneficiary must submit certain information and documentation via CBP One to apply for an advance travel authorization. To be eligible to receive advance travel authorization under the U4U or CHNV processes, applicants must undergo rigorous biographic screening and security vetting and provide documentation verifying residency requirements; vaccination and other public heath requirements; and possession of a valid, unexpired passport. Once authorization is granted, U4U or CHNV participants can then travel by air to an interior POE and be considered for a grant of parole, which is determined by CBP on a case-by-case basis. application security As with all CBP technology, ensuring the security and intended functionality of the CBP One platform is critical. To schedule an appointment at the land border using CBP One, users are required to submit biographic information, pass a geolocation check, and complete a live facial photo submission to schedule appointments. The geolocation check and live photo are key security measures to combat fraud by ensuring the person scheduling an appointment matches their registration, is a real person, and is located in Central or Northern Mexico. CBP One utilizes more secure GPS location data, rather than internet protocol (IP) addresses, to establish a user is in the designated geolocated location before they may request or accept an appointment offer. This makes the use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) ineffective. CBP One has also incorporated multiple additional security features such as the addition of CAPTCHA technology to authenticate human users, improved back-end system changes to combat bots and automation, and acting against accounts flagged for fraudulent activity. CBP continues to monitor CBP One and pursue additional functionality and security capabilities to combat against fraud and bad actors who prey on noncitizens. arrival at a port of entry CBP One is a valuable tool for streamlining processes, but in no way does the technology replace or automate an individual's inspection by a CBP officer at a POE. Noncitizens who schedule an appointment at a land border POE through CBP One are inspected upon arrival by CBP officers to determine their admissibility to the United States. Officers must verify the identity, nationality/citizenship, and stated intent for entry of each individual. This can be established through questioning and review of travel documents. An inspection will always include a review of law enforcement systems for prior immigration encounters or criminal history of the noncitizen. Officers will perform further questioning to determine if the individual is admissible or should be referred for a secondary inspection. If an individual is deemed inadmissible for, as an example, not having the appropriate documentation for admission, they will be subject to appropriate immigration processes under Title 8. CBP officers retain discretion in determining the appropriate process for each noncitizen on a case-by-case basis and while considering the totality of the circumstances. As an example, a noncitizen may be issued a Notice to Appear (NTA) before an immigration judge or, depending on the charge of inadmissibility, may be issued an Order of Expedited Removal. Individuals processed for expedited removal proceedings who express a fear of persecution or torture, a fear of return to their country, or who express a desire to seek asylum, are referred to USCIS for a credible fear or reasonable fear interview. CBP officers do not determine the validity of any claims of fear. Individuals issued a NTA and placed in removal proceedings will have the opportunity to seek protection, including asylum, or other forms of relief before an immigration judge. Additionally, noncitizens may be granted parole, on a case-by-case basis, for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit, at a POE. In some cases, parole may occur following the issuance of an NTA. The authority for CBP to grant such a parole is found in 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5) and 8 CFR 212.5. Noncitizens who are determined to pose a national security or public safety threat, or who otherwise do not warrant parole as a matter of officer discretion, will not be authorized a grant of parole and may be detained pending further processing. conclusion CBP One, used alongside other resources, technology, and personnel, is a critical tool for helping front-line officers manage increased flows of irregular migration while maintaining a persistent focus on our other missions, like the interdiction of fentanyl, precursors, and other dangerous drugs. As we respond and adapt to evolving border dynamics, OFO will continue investing in innovative technology and fulfilling our border security mission by deploying resources, streamlining processes, and putting measures in place to prevent disruptions to our critical border security operations. OFO remains committed, vigilant, and responsive to the full range of our responsibilities including interdicting illicit drugs, preventing dangerous people and goods from crossing into our borders, enforcing hundreds of trade laws, and ensuring the efficient flow of lawful trade and travel that is so important to our economy. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I look forward to your questions. Mr. Higgins. Thank you, Ms. Sabatino. I now recognize Ms. Meckley for 5 minutes to summarize her opening statement. STATEMENT OF TAMMY MECKLEY, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR, IMMIGRATION RECORDS AND IDENTITY SERVICES DIRECTORATE, U.S. CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES Ms. Meckley. Chairman Green, Chairman Higgins, Chairman Bishop, Ranking Members Thompson, Correa, Ivey, and distinguished Members of the subcommittees. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today about the operations of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. USCIS is the Government agency that oversees lawful immigration to the United States, and I am proud to serve with over 20,000 Government employees who work at more than 200 USCIS field offices across the country and the world to accomplish this mission. USCIS remains steadfast in its commitment to ensuring a fair, orderly, and humane immigration system consistent with U.S. law and international obligations. As part of our mission, USCIS helps administer parole processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans and their immediate family members. These processes are designed to help support the Department of Homeland Security's broader strategy to disincentivize irregular migration by simultaneously expanding the availability of safe, orderly, and lawful processes, and strictly enforcing our Nation's immigration laws by imposing consequences on individuals who do not avail themselves of these lawful pathways. I am here today to explain USCIS's role in the execution of these parole processes. DHS established the parole process for Venezuelans in October 2022, and the parole processes for Cubans, Haitians, and Nicaraguans in January 2023. Through these processes, certain nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, CHNV, and their immediate family members may request to come to the United States in a safe and orderly way. The processes are capped at 30,000 parolees per month across the 4 nationalities. USCIS's role in the CHNV process is to assess whether the potential supporter in the United States who commits to providing financial and other support for the beneficiary by filing a form I-134A on-line request to be a supporter and declaration of financial support meets established requirements. To serve as a supporter in this process, an individual or an individual representing an entity must be a U.S. citizen, national, or lawful permanent resident, or hold a lawful status in the United States, such as temporary protected status, asylum, or be a parolee or recipient of deferred action for deferred enforcement departure. The potential supporter must show evidence of sufficient financial resources to qualify as a supporter for purposes of CHNV parole process. USCIS uses Federal poverty guidelines as a general guide to assess financial sufficiency. Potential supporters who file a form I-134A on behalf of a beneficiary under these processes must be willing and able to receive, maintain, and support the listed beneficiary for the duration of their parole and articulate how they will do so. USCIS employs a multi-faceted approach to screening and vetting potential supporters. At filing, system checks are initiated automatically on supporters for all submissions. These checks will automatically flag cases with matching records or hits. USCIS officers determine whether the hit relates to the potential supporter. If a hit relates to a potential supporter, the USCIS officer will determine whether the hit impacts the potential supporter's eligibility for these processes. USCIS also uses a wide range of risk-based modeling and biographic searches, initiate referrals to its fraud detection national security directorate for additional screening of potential supporters, and even site visits or administrative investigation where appropriate. This can occur at all stages of the process and is based on a continuously-reassessed risk factor and direct referral from reviewers, tips, or biographic data screens. Once a potential supporter has filed the form I-134A and is confirmed or nonconfirmed by USCIS, our role is complete. The beneficiary then receives email instructions for creating a USCIS on-line account and must confirm their biographic information and complete necessary attestations for themselves and, if applicable, immediate family members. Once this information has been submitted, CBP determines whether to issue an advance travel authorization to the beneficiary and makes a case-by-case parole determination at the port of entry. Thank you again for the opportunity to explain our role, and I would be happy to answer any questions.  Prepared Statement of Tammy Meckley March 21, 2024 Chairman Higgins, Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Correa, Ranking Member Ivey, and distinguished Members of the subcommittees: Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today about the operational execution of some of the processes U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) helps administer. USCIS is the Government agency that oversees lawful immigration to the United States, and I am proud to serve with the over 20,000 Government employees and contractors that work at more than 200 USCIS offices across the country and the world to accomplish this mission. USCIS remains steadfast in its commitment to ensuring a fair, orderly, and humane immigration system, consistent with U.S. law and international obligations. As part of our mission, USCIS helps administer parole processes for Ukrainians, Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans and their immediate family members.

I am here today to explain USCIS's role in the execution of these parole processes. background Building on the success of the Uniting for Ukraine parole process, DHS established the parole process for Venezuelans in October 2022 and the parole processes for Cubans, Haitians, and Nicaraguans in January 2023. Through these processes, certain nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV) and their immediate family members may request to come to the United States in a safe and orderly way. The processes are capped at 30,000 parolees per month across the four nationalities. Eligible beneficiaries, who are outside the United States, may be considered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit, for advance authorization to travel and a temporary period of parole for up to 2 years. To participate, eligible beneficiaries must: Have a confirmed supporter in the United States who must first complete a process with USCIS; Undergo and clear robust security vetting; Meet other eligibility criteria; and Warrant a favorable exercise of discretion. parole supporter definition and requirements USCIS's role in the CHNV processes is to assess whether a potential supporter in the United States who commits to providing financial and other support for the beneficiary by filing Form I-134A, Online Request to be a Supporter and Declaration of Financial Support, meets established requirements. The supporter is the individual who pledges to provide financial support to the beneficiary for the duration of the parole authorization period. To serve as a supporter in this process, an individual or an individual representing an entity must: Be a U.S. citizen, national, or lawful permanent resident; hold a lawful status in the United States, such as Temporary Protected Status or asylum; or be a parolee or recipient of deferred action or Deferred Enforced Departure; Pass security and background vetting, including for public safety, national security, human trafficking, and exploitation concerns; and Demonstrate sufficient financial resources to receive, maintain, and support the individual(s) they are agreeing to support for the duration of their parole period. The supporter is required to submit a Form I-134A for each individual they wish to support and demonstrate the adequacy of financial resources to support that individual during their stay in the United States. Financial support may be offered by organizations, businesses, or other entities, however, the I-134A must be filed by an individual. In those instances, USCIS reviewers may accept a letter of commitment from the organization and consider its financial resources. sufficient financial evidence The potential supporter must show evidence of sufficient financial resources to qualify as a supporter for purposes of the CHNV parole processes. USCIS uses the Federal Poverty Guidelines as a general guide to assess financial sufficiency. Potential supporters who file Form I-134A on behalf of a beneficiary under these processes must be willing and able to receive, maintain, and support the listed beneficiary for the duration of their parole, and articulate how they will do so. Examples of evidence to show sufficient financial resources can include tax documents, bank statements, and pay stubs. Potential supporters are also required to describe in detail their plan for providing essential support to beneficiaries, such as basic living needs, appropriate housing, and access to available services and benefits, such as learning English, securing employment, and enrolling in school. security screening USCIS employs a multi-faceted approach to screening and vetting potential supporters. At filing, system checks are initiated automatically on supporters for all submissions. These checks will automatically flag cases with matching records (or ``hits''). USCIS officers determine whether the hit relates to the potential supporter. If the hit relates to the potential supporter, the USCIS officer will determine whether the hit impacts the potential supporter's eligibility for these processes. For example: The potential supporter is subject to an order of protection. The potential supporter is under investigation for, has been arrested for (without disposition), or has been convicted of any of the following offenses: Egregious Public Safety;\1\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ An Egregious Public Safety case is defined by USCIS and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the 2020 Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) Between USCIS and ICE Regarding the Referral of Immigration Benefit Fraud and Public Safety Cases. This includes murder, sexual abuse of a minor, and illicit trafficking of controlled substances or trafficking of persons but this is not exhaustive. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Adam Walsh Act violations; Domestic violence; Sexual assault; or Immigration fraud.\2\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \2\ Immigration fraud is defined by USCIS in the Policy Manual under Chapter 2--Overview of Fraud and Willful Misrepresentation. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The potential supporter poses a potential national security, public safety, or trafficking concern, as indicated by the hit. Any association with crimes involving children (child exploitation, child sex abuse, child abuse, etc.) or trafficking in persons. USCIS also uses a wide range of risk-based modeling and biographic searches to initiate referrals to its Fraud Detection and National Security (FDNS) Directorate for additional screening of potential supporters, and even site visits or administrative investigation where appropriate. This can occur at all stages of the process and is based on continuously reassessed risk factors and on direct referrals from reviewers, tips, or biographic data scrapes. Once the potential supporter has filed the Form I-134A and it is confirmed by USCIS, the beneficiary receives emailed instructions for creating a USCIS on-line account and linking their case. In the on-line account, the beneficiary reviews and confirms their biographic information and completes necessary attestations (including attestations for eligibility and vaccines) for themselves and, if applicable, immediate family members. Once this information has been submitted, CBP determines whether to issue an advance travel authorization to the beneficiary and makes a case-by-case parole determination at the port of entry. conclusion Thank you again for the opportunity to explain our role, and I would be happy to answer any questions. Mr. Higgins. Thank you, Ms. Meckley. I now recognize Ms. Youth for 5 minutes to summarize her opening statement. STATEMENT OF MARTA YOUTH, PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY, BUREAU OF POPULATION, REFUGEES, AND MIGRATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE Ms. Youth. Good afternoon, Chair Higgins, Ranking Member Correa, Chair Bishop, Ranking Member Ivey, Chair Green, and distinguished Members of the committee. I'm pleased to be here today to share with you the latest on our efforts to respond to the challenge of irregular migration and forced displacement in the Western Hemisphere. The world is facing historic levels of human mobility and the Western Hemisphere is no exception. Last year, more than 20 million people were displaced across our region. For an effective response, we need more than humanitarian aid and increased enforcement. We need to consider the unique reasons that people are on the move. Some are fleeing persecution, violence, natural disasters. Others are seeking economic opportunity and others to be reunified with family members. The administration's comprehensive policy is a solutions- oriented approach. We're working to address the causes that lead people to migrate, create protection and integration mechanisms in the region so that people have the option to remain, the option to remain closer to home, and facilitate safe, humane, orderly, and lawful migration pathways for others. Today I'll share some of the work we're doing as part of this broad, comprehensive, collaborative approach to migration management in the region. Since 2021, to address irregular migration and ensure our national security, the United States has led an expansion of lawful pathways to the United States. The Safe Mobility initiative known by the Spanish name Mobilidad Segura, is one of the many ways the United States is facilitating access to safe and lawful pathways to countries in the region so that refugees do not have to undertake dangerous journeys in search of safety. Safe Mobility offices are currently operational in Columbia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Ecuador. The Safe Mobility initiative revolutionized how we are able to screen, refer, and process individuals in the region for refugee resettlement. Safe Mobility offices also serve as hubs for providing information about lawful pathways, and it informs ineligible individuals about services and programs available to them in their application country or their country of origin so that they can have safe, supported options to remain where they are. We're working to expand the reach and scope of the Safe Mobility initiative. Strengthening pathways to the United States and other countries through this initiative is groundbreaking and will prove essential to meeting the needs of the day, protecting our border, promoting safe and orderly migration, while still taking advantage of the wealth of benefits that refugees and migrants bring to local communities and the overall economy of the United States. While refugee resettlement is a critical lifeline for certain groups of people, asylum in other countries within Latin America is an excellent option for many in need of international protection. Humanitarian assistance, generously provided by Congress to the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, has had a significant impact in stabilizing displaced populations in host countries, especially by strengthening access to asylum and regularization in countries like Columbia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, and many others. These programs, in conjunction with partner country efforts, have provided access to protection and stability to millions of individuals and have helped to mitigate their movements to the U.S. border to seek safety. The United States is the global leader in delivering Humanitarian assistance world-wide, including in the Western Hemisphere. With this assistance, our international humanitarian organization partners deliver life-saving water, support for shelter, sanitation, and emergency medical assistance to refugees, asylum seekers, internally displaced persons, state-less persons, and vulnerable migrants. Our assistance stabilizes refugees and vulnerable migrants in their host communities, helps them integrate and rebuild their lives and find solutions closer to home so that displaced people can remain in host communities and avoid dangerous journeys to the United States. Responding to the Western hemisphere's largest migration and forced displacement crisis in history requires an approach as comprehensive as the reasons that people are on the move. When combining stronger, lawful pathways and protection options within the region with root causes programming, repatriation, border management, and increased consequences for irregular entry, these efforts make up the administration's holistic approach to create safe, humane, lawful, and orderly migration options within the region. In closing, I would like to thank the Members of the subcommittees for the opportunity to discuss these critical issues and the work we're doing to meet the challenges of the moment. We appreciate your support.  Prepared Statement of Marta Youth March 21, 2024 Good afternoon, Chair Higgins, Chair Bishop, Ranking Member Correa, Ranking Member Ivey, and distinguished Members of the committee. I am pleased to be here today to share with you the latest on our efforts to respond to the historic levels of irregular migration and forced displacement in the Western Hemisphere. migration and forced displacement challenge--context The world is facing historic levels of human mobility, and the Western Hemisphere is no exception. Last year, over 20 million people were displaced across the region. While the United States has been the destination for many, we are far from alone. Of the more than 7.5 million Venezuelans living outside their country, over 6.5 million are in Latin America and Caribbean. Costa Rica is now hosting over 500,000 Nicaraguan refugees and migrants fleeing the Ortega regime. These individuals are on the move alongside others from Central and South America, from the Caribbean, and from elsewhere in the world. It is clear that no one country alone is impacted, and that no one country holds the solutions. For an effective response, we need more than just humanitarian aid and increased enforcement. We must consider the unique reasons people are on the move--some are fleeing persecution, violence, and natural disasters, others seek economic opportunity, and others family reunification. To account for these distinct needs and circumstances, the administration's comprehensive approach is to address the causes that lead people to migrate, create protection mechanisms within the region, and facilitate safe, orderly, humane and lawful migration pathways. This holistic approach involves strengthening national asylum, registration, regularization, and integration frameworks; improving humane border enforcement and repatriation capabilities abroad; preventing refoulement; and increasing the consequences for irregular entry to the United States. We have worked to make this comprehensive approach regional, by partnering with 21 countries from across the hemisphere through the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection. Today, I will share some of the work we are doing as part of this broad, comprehensive, and collaborative approach to migration management in the region. Strengthening Pathways to the United States and Third Countries Outside Latin America and the Caribbean Since 2021, to address irregular migration and ensure our national security, the United States has led the largest expansion in decades of lawful pathways to the United States to help refugees, vulnerable migrants, and forcibly displaced persons in the Western Hemisphere. Individuals seeking international protection and other lawful pathways have various potential options for regular migration to the United States and other countries, including refugee resettlement, humanitarian parole, family reunification, labor pathways, and seeking asylum in host countries, subject to meeting eligibility criteria. They can also access various support services provided by international organizations and NGO's in the region. The Safe Mobility initiative (known by the Spanish name Movilidad Segura) is one of the many ways the United States is facilitating access to safe and lawful pathways from countries in the region, so refugees do not have to undertake dangerous journeys in search of safety. Safe Mobility Offices (SMOs) are currently operational in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Guatemala. The Safe Mobility initiative revolutionized how we refer and process individuals in the region for refugee resettlement. The SMOs also serve as hubs for providing information about humanitarian parole, family reunification, and labor pathways. Applicants apply via an on- line platform through which experts from international organizations, specifically the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the U.N. Refugee Agency (UNHCR), help individuals assess which, if any, lawful pathways might work for them. More than 150,000 people already registered on MovilidadSegura.org. And if the individuals are not eligible for any of those lawful pathways, they are informed about services and programs available to them in their application country or country of origin to give them safe, supported options to remain where they are. The Safe Mobility initiative is designed to provide access to a range of lawful pathways to the United States but also to other countries as well. Refugee resettlement processing is just one option available via SMOs. Individuals who qualify for resettlement to the United States under the Safe Mobility initiative undergo expedited refugee processing based on lessons learned in the administration's effort to rebuild the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). These refugee applicants undergo the same rigorous and multi-layered interagency screening and vetting process as all other refugees and, if eligible, most will arrive in the United States in just a matter of months. As of March 3, through the Safe Mobility initiative, more than 22,200 individuals have been referred to USRAP for potential resettlement to the United States, and more than 14,000 individuals have been screened for other lawful pathways to the United States. More than 6,500 individuals have already arrived in the United States under the Safe Mobility initiative. We are also working with other migrant-hosting countries to expand lawful pathways, including labor pathways with Spain and Canada. Almost 300 vulnerable migrants in Costa Rica have been referred for resettlement to Spain via the SMO mechanism. We are working to expand the reach of the SMOs. An interagency working group focused on lawful pathways to third countries is working with other countries to connect them to the Safe Mobility initiative. Working closely with international organization partners, we are building capacity, running extensive messaging campaigns, and exponentially increasing the number of people who receive information or services via the SMOs. In the refugee pathway, for example, we aim to resettle between 35,000 and 50,000 individuals in fiscal year 2024, an historic and ambitious goal which would amount to an increase in refugee resettlement from the Western Hemisphere of over 450 percent from last year. Strengthening pathways to the United States and other countries through the SMOs is a groundbreaking approach that will prove essential in helping meet the needs of the day: protecting our borders, promoting safe and orderly migration, while still taking advantage of the wealth of benefits that refugees and migrants bring to local communities and the overall economy of United States. Strengthening Protection Options Within the Region While refugee resettlement is a critical lifeline for certain groups of people, asylum in other countries within Latin America is an excellent option for many in need of international protection. The humanitarian assistance funds Congress has generously provided to the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) to administer has had a significant impact in stabilizing displaced populations in host countries, especially by strengthening access to asylum and regularization in countries like Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Mexico. These programs, in conjunction with partner country efforts, have provided access to protection and stability for millions of individuals and have helped to mitigate movements to the U.S. border to seek safety. The United States is the global leader in delivering humanitarian assistance world-wide, including in the Western Hemisphere. PRM provided more than $594 million of the funding entrusted to us by Congress in humanitarian assistance in the Western Hemisphere in fiscal year 2023. With this assistance, our international humanitarian organization partners deliver lifesaving water, shelter, sanitation, and emergency health care to refugees, asylum seekers, internally displaced persons, stateless persons, and vulnerable migrants. Our assistance stabilizes refugees and vulnerable migrants in their host communities and provides solutions closer to home so that displaced people can remain in host communities and avoid dangerous journeys toward the United States. This assistance also helps host countries receive refugees and migrants as an opportunity for social inclusion and economic growth. Those who are able to integrate and rebuild their lives closer to home are much less likely to continue the dangerous journey northward. The humanitarian funding PRM oversees bolsters our partners' capacity-strengthening work with host governments to develop effective and efficient asylum systems, strengthen humane migration management mechanisms, and give local communities the resources they need to welcome and integrate refugees and other vulnerable populations. With our support through our partner, UNHCR, Mexico's national refugee commission increased its registration and processing capacity by nearly 500 percent since 2018. In 2023, Mexico was the country with the third-highest number of asylum claims in the world. Through our humanitarian partners, we also support Costa Rica's asylum agency, including 90 percent of its staff costs. Despite its relatively small size, the country hosts more than 600,000 Nicaraguans and received the fourth-highest number of asylum claims in the world in 2023, behind only the United States, Germany, and Mexico. Colombia and Ecuador have taken significant steps to improve migrant access to regularization and support services. With PRM assistance, partner organizations helped Colombia develop and implement a 10-year temporary protected status program that so far has allowed over 1.6 million Venezuelans to work and access health and education services in Colombia. And in Ecuador, PRM partners IOM and UNHCR provide essential staffing and technical support to Ecuador's ambitious registration and regularization program. Since the program started in August 2022, more than 201,000 individuals completed registration, 83,600 have received a temporary residency visa, and more than 64,000 have received an Ecuadorian ID card. All these efforts to build asylum capacity and help migrants and refugees access legal status and services in the region have allowed millions of individuals to gain the legal status that allows them to remain and lead dignified lives throughout the region. In interviews with humanitarian partners, displaced persons in Mexico and at our Southwest Border often report moving and hiding within their home country multiple times before fleeing across a border. We know that when these individuals have a viable option to stay in their country safely, that is the option they choose. Through our U.N. and other partners, we work with governments in the region to strengthen local protection responses for internally displaced persons, so they need not resort to crossing an international border. When we talk about supporting options for people to restart their lives within the region as opposed to coming here, improving access to protection, whether through asylum or other temporary status, is only part of the challenge. All this work on strengthening administrative processing capacity and reforming legal frameworks only pays off if the circumstances in host countries enable refugees to rebuild their lives and become self- reliant. This means being able to enroll their kids in school, access local health care and other social services, get jobs and housing, and open bank accounts--which is why PRM also supports local integration efforts throughout the region. For example, we support UNHCR, in coordination with the government of Mexico, to help refugees get jobs, including in Mexican cities with labor shortages along the country's industrial belt. Since its inception, this program has helped more than 30,000 refugees find dignified, decent work and rebuild their lives in Mexico. The program has an average retention rate after a year of around 70 percent. Just this year, our support in Guatemala enabled the authorities there to transition to a fully on-line system for issuing work permits to asylum seekers with pending claims, reducing the average wait time from 15 to 4 business days. In Brazil, the Brazilian government voluntarily relocated more than 100,000 Venezuelans from the border to more than 930 Brazilian cities since 2018, representing a quarter of the 426,000 Venezuelans who have arrived in Brazil. This relocation effort, supported by PRM partners who rely on U.S. humanitarian funding, enables Venezuelans in Brazil to better access jobs, housing, and education, as well as reunite families. Our approach to integration includes support for host communities as well, which is critical to promoting social cohesion and mitigating the risk of rising xenophobia. Regional Circular Labor Migration Pathways One of the many reasons people migrate is for economic opportunity. When these workers lack lawful means to migrate, they are more vulnerable to exploitation and abuse, whether by human smugglers or traffickers or in the workplace. This is why our approach to expanding access to lawful pathways includes increasing the availability of temporary labor pathways with worker protections to the United States but also to third countries, including within the region. The H-2 visa program is the primary pathway for seasonal migrants to find temporary work in the United States while supporting U.S. employers in certain sectors. On November 17, 2023, the Department of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Department of Labor, exercised a temporary increase of 64,716 H-2B temporary nonagricultural worker visas for fiscal year 2024. Twenty thousand of these visas are reserved for nationals of Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, and Honduras. At the same time, we are working across the U.S. Government to enhance safeguards in these programs, to better protect the rights of all workers in the United States. Beyond labor pathways to the United States, or as previously mentioned to Spain and Canada and other countries in the future, we are also working to strengthen pathways and protection for migrant workers elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere. PRM funding to IOM enables labor migration capacity building that engages governments and private-sector actors in the region to strengthen their labor pathways and implement ethical recruitment practices. One highly successful outcome of these efforts is Costa Rica's bilateral temporary labor migration mechanisms in the agricultural sector. Over 27,800 migrant workers from Nicaragua and Panama have benefited from these mechanisms, making an important contribution to the Costa Rican economy during the coffee harvest. And we expect the program to expand to additional countries in Central America this year. This exemplifies the kind of programming PRM seeks to support. It increases worker protections and allows individuals to access economic opportunities while remaining closer to their families. It also leverages existing data on circular migration flows to regularize pathways where the need is greatest. In doing so, the program directly cuts down on irregular migration at its inception and reduces instances of abuse and exploitation. closing Responding to the Western Hemisphere's largest migration and forced displacement crisis in history requires an approach as comprehensive as the reasons people are on the move. Expanding access to lawful pathways; strengthening local options such as asylum, regularization, and reintegration frameworks; and promoting integration into host communities are just one portion of the administration's comprehensive plan. Combined with root causes programming, repatriation, border management, and increased consequences for irregular entry, these efforts make up the administration's holistic approach to create safe, humane, lawful and orderly migration options within the region. In closing, I'd like to thank the Members of these subcommittees for the opportunity to discuss these critical issues and the work we are doing to meet the challenges of the moment. We appreciate your support. Mr. Higgins. Thank you, Ms. Youth, for your opening statement. Members will be recognized by order of seniority for their 5 minutes of questioning. An additional round of questioning may be called after all Members have been recognized. I'll now recognize myself for 5 minutes of questioning. Before I begin, I would like to welcome Mr. Suozzi. I'm going to call you Suozzi forever. The gentleman from New York is, indeed, a gentleman. He won a special election, and we appreciate his presence on the committee. He's a regular guy at the gym, and so we welcome you here, sir. I look forward to your input. Mr. Suozzi. Thank you. Mr. Higgins. Mr. Hunter, how would you define--this is not a trick question, by the way. How would you define a border, a sovereign border? Mr. Hunter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A sovereign border in the United States, and for any country, is critical under laws to ensure--it is the responsibility of the country to ensure-- -- Mr. Higgins. Would you describe a sovereign border as a definite line between a sovereign nation and, say, international waters or between sovereign nations? Mr. Hunter. It is indeed, Mr. Chairman---- Mr. Higgins. Indeed, it is. Mr. Hunter . A demarcation, yes. Mr. Higgins. So you would concur that a sovereign border is a definite line? Mr. Hunter. It's where the United States exercises its authorities, yes, sir. It is where the United States---- Mr. Higgins. Thus we have shifted. So it's where a sovereign nation exercises its authority upon sovereign soil, would you say, like our embassies--our embassies across the world are considered our sovereign soil, are they not? Mr. Hunter. I believe so. I would defer to my State Department colleague on our consul----- Mr. Higgins. So you've initially interpreted a border in the traditional and historical sense of what a border is. I recall years ago, in one of my many, many trips to the border, there was only a couple of us there, and I ventured across the water there on the rocks where the illegal immigrants had been crossing by the hundreds at this particular point. The agents present were quite concerned lest I take one step too many as I walked toward the center, they're like, Congressman, don't take another step--because one more step and I was in Mexico. That's our sovereign border. This is the historical understanding of our border. But in April 2023, the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security announced measures to, ``to reduce unlawful migration across the Western Hemisphere, significantly expand lawful pathways for protection, and facilitate the safe, orderly, and humane processing of migrants''. This is a quote that was cited by a couple of the panelists here before us today. These are the words of the Biden administration. This announcement further expanded the CBP One app, creating a whole new parole process and opening, Regional Processing Centers in the Western Hemisphere. As far as we know, the Regional Processing Centers--pay attention, America, with what's going on here--these Regional Processing Centers, also known as Safe Mobility Offices, have been opened in Ecuador, Colombia, Guatemala, and Costa Rica, and have allowed DHS to quickly process illegal immigrants in the cartel pipeline, wishing to enter the United States, or stating that their intention is to enter the United States, should they continue their journey northward in the cartel pipeline that leads to the southern sovereign border of the United States of America. These Regional Processing Centers, which is hard to get a clear picture of, it's difficult to get maps, numbers, deployments, mission parameters, makes no sense to me why, with the historic crisis at our border, you know, hundreds of thousands of individuals entering the country every month--not every year, every month--makes no sense to most Americans when they discover we're processing and transporting immigrants from within foreign nations, not on sovereign American soil, not through ports of entry, but through these Regional Processing Centers. Under this new system, the entire world has become the sovereign American border by the interpretation of the Biden administration. If you have legal authority to establish Regional Processing Centers in Ecuador, Colombia, Guatemala, and Costa Rica--and I'm about to ask you to please cite that legal authority--then why can't you--can you put those up everywhere in the world? We no longer have a sovereign border to defend and enforce our laws? We can process illegal immigrants, undocumented illegal immigrants, unscreened, directly into the interior of our country. This is quite a concern. Ms. Sabatino, from these processing centers, are illegal, undocumented aliens being registered through CBP One app, granted parole and flown directly into the interior of the United States, bypassing what most Americans would recognize as our sovereign border? Ms. Sabatino. Thank you for the question, Chairman. With respect to individuals processed through the Safe Mobility Office, CBP does not have a role in identifying or---- Mr. Higgins. So who would you defer that to--Mr. Hunter? Ms. Sabatino. With respect to the Safe Mobility Office---- Mr. Higgins. With respect to illegal immigrants that are plucked out of the cartel pipeline in Central America, at a DHS-established Regional Processing Center, are any of those illegal aliens being flown directly from foreign nations into the interior of our country? Can we get a straight answer there? Mr. Hunter. Mr. Chairman, the operations at these Safe Mobility Offices are in partnership with the Department of State and these host-country governments. What we are doing are screening individuals who are maybe eligible for existing pathways such as refugee resettlement, and we are conducting full, refugee-resettlement screening and vetting processes---- Mr. Higgins. Are they being flown into the interior of our country? Mr. Hunter. If they are indeed approved to be resettled as refugees, then the standard process is applied. They are being organized---- Mr. Higgins. This was how you try to get to a ``yes,'' America. The answer is, yes, illegal aliens are being pulled from the cartel pipeline at DHS-established Regional Processing Centers in Central and South America and flown directly into the interior of our country. My time has expired. I now recognize the Ranking Member for his questions. Mr. Correa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and, again, I thank the witnesses for your information here. You know, I started out talking big picture, resources, causes, but let's bring it down to what we may be able to do here. So let's break it down. How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. So let's start out with what appears to be the issue right now--the border flooded with refugees, probably economic refugees that probably wouldn't qualify for admission under the existing laws of the United States. I don't agree with that law because under this existing law, most of our ancestors probably wouldn't qualify to come to this country. But that's what the U.S. law is right now. You essentially have to establish that you're fleeing from another country, for your life, your fear, kind-of a more-or- less legal reason that you can come to the United States. The challenge right now--and I'm going to ask all of you to help me frame this--is the processing of the refugees. Is that correct? Is that a big issue at the border right now? Yes? No? Mr. Hunter. Mr. Hunter. Yes, Mr. Ranking Member, the challenge is the number of individuals that are seeking to enter the United States. We have a requirement under law that we inspect and process every individual who comes to a port of entry and---- Mr. Correa. You don't have the capability of doing it right now? Mr. Hunter. Correct. We have limited resources, sir---- Mr. Correa. You need more processing, USCIS officers and immigration judges, which we don't. We have a massive backlog. So let's think about this. Where are we putting our resources? Right now, tomorrow, we're going to vote on a minibus--we call it a minibus--bill. We're going to fully fund 22,000 Border Patrol agents. These are the green uniforms. That's my understanding. I just read that a couple hours ago. People will process, at the gates to the United States, essentially there's only 150 blue uniforms that will be essentially funded tomorrow. I think that's just way too few. You're--the people that are part of that processing to come to the United States or not. I don't know if there's any funding for USCIS offices and immigration judges. Again, you got people coming in. You want to process them under the law which--in a reasonable time period. If you were to do that, probably most of these individuals wouldn't qualify to come to the United States. Is that correct? Please, anybody jump in. Mr. Hunter. Mr. Ranking Member, we do see that once individuals are in the United States, they do have the right to claim asylum, and most do before an immigration judge. That process, as you've observed, takes far too long. It can take 5 to 8 years to resolve, and the grant rates ultimately in that process, I believe, are under 30 percent. Mr. Correa. Ms. Sabatino, any thoughts on that? Ms. Sabatino. Agree with Deputy Assistant Secretary Hunter. Mr. Correa. Yes, yes. Ms. Meckley, Ms. Youth, any thoughts? What I'm trying to do is trying to figure out what everybody's talking about here. OK? That we have a challenge at the border, a refugee crisis, economic or political. Under existing laws, if you're an economic refugee, you wouldn't qualify under our laws to come. If you're a refugee because of fearing for life, you would qualify. Yet the argument is CBP One is that magic ticket to come to the United States. Is it, first of all, CBP One, the magic ticket to come to the United States or just a processing tool? Ms. Sabatino. I'll take that one. Mr. Correa. Yes. Ms. Sabatino. CBP One is a processing tool. Certainly prior to the implementation of CBP One, with any mass or surge to any of our ports of entry, our officers would've been---- Mr. Correa. You check that against your known databases? Yes? No? Ms. Sabatino. We check it against a host of law enforcement---- Mr. Correa. You vet? Mr. Bishop, I can't read your smile. So tell me, you disagree with that. Mr. Bishop. Well, if the gentleman is yielding, how do they vet the criminal databases about where the people are coming from? Mr. Correa. Ms. Sabatino, how do you vet this stuff? Ms. Sabatino. We run the individuals against the TSDS or the watchlist. We certainly run them against TECS, which is our comprehensive law enforcement database, and that database is comprised of information such as prior immigration encounters but also information provided by the Department of State or information that we've gleaned from other international partnerships, as well as---- Mr. Correa. The same partnerships--I'm out of time, but if I can, Mr. Chairman, just have a moment--I'm trying to establish here that you do process the same databases that you probably have, that we have here in the centers that we have here in Washington, DC, to determine whether these individuals are suspected terrorists, watch list? Yes? No? Ms. Sabatino. The most important resource in this process is the CBP officer, the trained, skilled CBP officers, including our tactical terrorism response teams who interview the individuals that are suspected of having derogatory information. Mr. Correa. I'm going to stop. I'm out of time, but what I was trying to establish folks is, what's the bottleneck here? What's the problem with the border and why are officers overwhelmed? Why can't we make these quick decisions there, and what is it that it's going to take? Tomorrow we're going to vote on a minibus, more green uniforms, very few blue uniforms, but is that the solution, or are we still looking at still, you know, essentially swimming upstream. Mr. Chairman, I look forward to continuing this discussion. Thank you. Mr. Higgins. The gentleman yields. I now recognize the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Bishop. Mr. Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do always find the juxtaposition of comments from Mr. Correa and mine to be helpful to me, because I think you've hit on it. Before you can solve a problem, you've got to discern what it is. So if you're going to send more money for border agents to process people faster into the United States, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me that you're likely to have the result of fewer people coming into the United States. Just a guess. Well, no, no. I am--I am--I'm starting there, believe me, I'm getting ready to. Believe me. Believe me. Mr. Hunter, I was struck by the beginning of your testimony. You say--at the beginning of your testimony, you listed causes of this significant increase in irregular migration--violence, food insecurity, severe poverty, corruption, climate change, fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, dire economic conditions. That's 7. Let me ask you this. I'm looking at the, I think this is the National Immigration Law Center, a pro-immigration group, says, it described this, and it's one of--you can find this description anywhere--on January 20, 2021, just hours after being sworn in, President Joe Biden took several immigration- related actions that together signal a new era for immigration policy. They comprise an important first step, redressing some of the ways in which immigrant communities have been profoundly harmed in particular over the last 4 years, and toward the United States becoming more welcoming of immigrants and refugees. There's an appearance of Secretary Mayorkas on CNN that everybody's seen recently in which he said, we've rescinded so many Trump immigration policies, it would take too much time to list them--too many to list. I wonder, as you were describing the causes of increased migration, why did you omit all of those landmark changes in policy by the Biden administration? Mr. Hunter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the question. In illustrating the various drivers of irregular migration, I was highlighting why people are on the move. When it comes to policies---- Mr. Bishop. Do those policies, those landmark policies, do they have anything to do with the significant increase in migration across the United States border that some of my colleagues are now saying is a crisis that Republicans need to solve? Mr. Hunter. Mr. Chairman, we have seen surges in irregular migration historically under Presidents of both parties---- Mr. Bishop. But I'm asking about these policies and whether they caused the crisis that we now see. Will you answer that question? Mr. Hunter. Mr. Chairman, no, our policies did not cause the reasons in rogue regimes such as Cuba, Nicaragua---- Mr. Bishop. So rogue regimes had something to do with it but not the dramatic change in policy by the Biden administration? Is that what you're testifying to this Congress? Mr. Hunter. The administration's policy and our strategy at DHS is to reduce irregular migration. Mr. Bishop. You believe it's been successful then in reducing irregular migration? Mr. Hunter. Within the boundaries of our authorities and resources, we have a two-pronged approach to enact and enforce---- Mr. Bishop. OK, OK, enough. Ms. Youth, let me switch to you because you were very candid. You said since--excuse me--since 2021, to address irregular migration and ensure our national security, the United States has led the largest expansion in decades of lawful pathways to the United States. So would you say that the increased migration across the Southern Border is a feature, not a bug? Ms. Youth. No. So lawful pathways is--are the pathways that people can use to arrive safely through the Southwest Border-- not through the Southwest Border--from---- Mr. Bishop. That's not what I asked you, though. Ms. Youth. Yes. Mr. Bishop. What I asked you is, would you say that the increased flow across the border is a feature, not a bug, of the policies of the Biden administration? Ms. Youth. No, I wouldn't say that it's a feature. Mr. Bishop. Is it a failure of the Biden administration then? Ms. Youth. No, I wouldn't say that it's a failure. I would say that this is a symptom of something that is happening all over the world. There are more than---- Mr. Bishop. Certainly not the fault of any Biden administration policy? Ms. Youth. There are 110 million people who are displaced globally, and 20 million of them are displaced in this region. This is something that we're seeing throughout the globe. Our European partners are also facing similar challenges. This is not something that is simply---- Mr. Bishop. I know. We've seen what happens in Europe and elsewhere in the world when American leadership there fails, too. But that doesn't explain why we've had the massive numbers from the beginning of the Biden administration across the U.S. border. But I think you've hit on it, that the most significant expansion in so-called lawful pathways--let me ask you this question. Doesn't the Congress make the law? Ms. Youth. Yes, sir. Mr. Bishop. So the administration doesn't make law, does it? Ms. Youth. No, sir. Mr. Bishop. That's exactly right. I've run out of time. Mr. Higgins. The gentleman yields. We will perhaps have a second round of questioning, just to remind Members. I now recognize Mrs. Ramirez for 5 minutes for questioning. Mrs. Ramirez. Thank you, Chairman Higgins. It's good to be in this joint committee hearing. So I'm going to probably take it back a bit. I want to come back to the purpose of this hearing. That's really examining CBP One. I want to first acknowledge out of the guests and stakeholders who have already provided feedback on CBP One's functionality and accessibility, as well as DHS's attempts to respond to feedback. You know, being a millennial, we talk a lot about technology, and I know that including mobile apps, it can play a critical role in modernizing our systems if thoughtfully developed and deployed. However, in our search for border-processing solutions, I do worry sometimes we sacrifice our responsibility to uphold the rights and safety of asylum seekers and--if we don't have the adequate systems that promote equitable access to immigration options. Many issues with the CBP One app have been reported since its scheduling feature was rolled out. I've talked about it in a couple of the hearings here before. To name a few, the wait times to receive an appointment remain extremely long, and only a few ports of entry accept appointments, which has forced people, asylum seekers, to wait for months in Mexico, often in dangerous conditions and without the ability to support themselves. The app presents access issues for people who do not speak one of the three languages. As we know it's Spanish, I think, English, and Korean. For those that have low or no literacy or not technologically savvy, they may not have access to a smartphone or internet services. We've heard this before. We've talked about security concerns have been raised regarding exploitation by bad actors in the collection of sensitive and personal information. So for my first set of questions, though, I want to start with Ms. Sabatino. In 1 minute, could you please share with me, what are CBP's plans to further address functionality issues with CBP One and make access to CBP One appointments more equitable? As you're answering that, can you also follow up with what is CBP doing to further increase the number of daily available appointments? Ms. Sabatino. Thank you for the question. Certainly with respect to the enhancements in the application, there's been 30 enhancements since this past summer, to ensure that bandwidth issues or other error messages have been mitigated. What's also been challenging with respect to the use of the CBP One app is the cyber threats that we're up against. We have a very comprehensive cyber strategy across CBP, not unique to CBP One, but we do encounter challenges, and we have made significant enhancements to that as well. With respect to the wait times for individuals in Mexico, it's averaging about 2\1/2\ months right now. We do have to take into consideration the operations at our ports of entry. We are not there just simply encountering inadmissible individuals who are attempting to enter the United States. We have the facilitation of lawful travel and trade. We also have to work outbound operations to interdict weapons and currency, and we have to make sure that we're intercepting narcotics, specifically fentanyl. So to ensure that we are not walking away from any of the missions, streamlining this process, ensuring that we get advance information to officers and automate it to the extent possible, but not also walk away from those other critical missions, we're not looking to expand the number of appointments---- Mrs. Ramirez. So you're not looking--let me stop you there then because I want to--I just want to make sure I had that on record. So we're not going to be expanding. I'm sure my colleagues on the other side are excited about that. So we're saying--and you also said that it's taking about 2\1/2\ months for people that are waiting in Mexico, those that already have those appointments and in some cases in really, really terrible conditions. We've read about that, and sometimes my colleagues, when they want to talk about caring about people, bring them up under the side. So let me stop and let me just go ahead and pivot for a minute here. I want to ask--and actually this question I'm going to ask of Ms. Meckley here. In 30 seconds--that's all I have--how has the agency, in your opinion, consulted with those directly impacted by CBP One? Border-enforcement efforts and those that are impacted, have you consulted with them as you're trying to make some of these many enhancements that folks talk about? In your opinion, can you give me a little bit of that? Ms. Meckley. Sure. When it comes to the ability to file-- for a supporter to file an I-134A on-line, we've integrated the entire system and experience between USCIS, and ICE--sorry--and CBP. There are parts of the process that USCIS is responsible for, in terms of reviewing that 134A, and if a supporter is found to have the financial and other support, you know, commitments and obligations are met, and that 134A is confirmed, then there is an exchange of information with CBP. So those systems---- Mrs. Ramirez. My time is up. If we have another round, I'll follow up with you, but thank you. I yield back, Chairman. Mr. Higgins. The gentlelady yields. The gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Ezell, is recognized for 5 minutes for questions. Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you all for being here today in this very important matter. I appreciate that. I want to highlight, once again, how this administration is making it much easier for illegal immigrants to enter this country. This DHS has rolled out a phone CBP One app, and on this app, the immigrants, the migrants, enter a few details before they receive an appointment that is supposed to be a vetting process. Let me describe the details of this process. During this appointment, it's been reported by the Texas Monthly magazine, ``After arriving for their appointments, they are not given an interview or asked no questions on the issues they submitted on the app or about why they are coming to the United States. They are simply released into the country''. I understand prior to their appointment, the information submitted is run through the U.S. criminal and national security databases. However, most of these individuals have never lived in the United States, so any crime would not be detected. Additionally, many of the migrants are attempting to come to the United States from countries that would never give us their criminal data, or from a country that doesn't even keep a criminal database. Being a law enforcement officer my entire life, I'm very familiar with running individuals, having been a chief of detectives, and a sheriff, and a chief of police. I know the only information that you get out of an NCIC, or a criminal history check, is something that has been entered into a database. I'd like a little more explanation, Ms. Sabatino, if you could talk to me a little bit about how intensive is this background, especially on somebody that's trying to deceive us or not give us proper information, or from a government that does not provide adequate information for us? Ms. Sabatino. Thank you for the question. In addition to the law enforcement database that we query against, we also leverage the watch list, travel data. I mentioned the criminal records that you referenced, NCICs. But we also have a derogatory photo index, that we match potentially their photos to, to identify individuals. But it really is important about the information sharing that we have, maybe not necessarily with the country the individual is coming from, but with a number of our other foreign partners. It is the information sharing across the hemisphere and globe frankly that makes us successful in identifying threats. But also there's a layer of, you know, partnering with the intelligence community to make sure that we have visibility on trends, identities, or issues, and then inform our CBP officers for the process. Again, why getting that advance information for our officers is so critical, that they have the time to actually assess and prepare for the individuals arriving at ports. Mr. Ezell. Do you really think we're getting enough information on this app to adequately--and I'll just open that up to everybody--are we getting enough information on this app to be able to really thoroughly vet these people before they get into the country? Ms. Sabatino. Thank you, sir. With respect to the information in the app, the biographic information, biometrics is also done through the app. The screening and matching against their facial derog. But I think we're always looking for more information across all of our operational environments, whether it be trade or passenger operations. I think the more information-sharing agreements that we can establish with our international partners, the better off we'll be. Mr. Ezell. What about developing sources, informants, that would help identify some of these folks that are coming over here? How well is that working for you these days? Ms. Sabatino. I think it's also important to note the over 70 locations in 40 countries where we do have foreign-deployed CBP personnel that work directly with our foreign law enforcement partners, but not unique just to CBP. Certainly ICE has resources overseas, and this is this information-sharing network that we also leverage. Mr. Ezell. You know what we want here is a safe way to do this, and there's so many folks that are coming across this border, as we all know, and it's causing so many problems across the country. We've seen it on a daily basis, the crimes that have been committed, and we have got, as law enforcement, to step up, do everything within our power to make this happen so that we can protect Americans. Right now the American people are, on a daily basis, calling us, complaining, telling us that this border's not secure. I've been down there myself. I've talked to the officers down there myself. I'm told they're not being allowed to do their jobs. I'm told they're not being able to completely do the things that they were hired to do because they're having to do other duties. I think that we really need to, going forward, take this a little more seriously. I know that you're following the orders of this administration, but I think that at some point we've got to step up and say, Hey, hey, this is enough--and do our jobs. So thank you very much again for this time. I yield back. Mr. Higgins. The gentleman yields. I recognize Mr. Ivey, the gentleman from Maryland, for 5 minutes for questions. Mr. Ivey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hunter, you've testified in your original statement that CBP One helps to cut out smugglers, and I wanted to give you a chance to elaborate on that. How exactly does that work? Mr. Hunter. Thank you, Mr. Ranking Member. What we are doing through CBP One in the border environment, as the executive assistant commissioner has spoken to, is creating a scheduling tool that migrants themselves can access. So we're putting the power of determining where and when individuals present at a port of entry in the individual's hand. They are not relying on that smuggler to take them across between ports of entry. Further, because the app is accessible in Central and Northern Mexico, we don't need--and migrants themselves--don't need to congregate in dangerous locations proximate to the border or be waiting near in long lines outside of our ports of entry. They can be in another location and then come for their arrival at a scheduled and appointed time. Mr. Ivey. All right. I wanted to ask you another question as well. Is it true that if a migrant has been fully cleared as a rightful refugee, that he or she is coming into the country legally and not illegally? Mr. Hunter. Yes, Congressman. In our U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, those decisions are made overseas. We determine that an individual passes and qualifies as a refugee, and they are admitted as refugees. Mr. Ivey. All right. Mr. Hunter. Immigration status. Mr. Ivey. Commissioner Sabatino, I wanted to ask you about staffing. You have a pretty large domain that you preside over. I think you've been asked a question about staffing already, but I do want to get a better feel for it because we've got some provisions floating around, you know, potentially funding new positions. But the number I saw was, there's a shortage of 4,000 CBP officers. Is that correct? Ms. Sabatino. Thank you for the question. That number is absolutely based on our workload staffing model that identifies a need for approximately 4,000 CBP officers on the front line. Mr. Ivey. OK. I think there's also an issue about judges shortages too which I wanted to--oh, I'm sorry--officers examining asylum claims, and the number I have there is 800. Is that right? Mr. Hunter. That sounds about right, Congressman. We can certainly have our budget folks confirm those numbers. Mr. Ivey. OK. Then, you know, obviously these adding, you know, getting the number--I don't know if we're going to get to 4,000 all at once--but adding those additional hires or even working our way toward it, what sort of assistance would that provide to you? How would that help you to address the issues at the border? Ms. Sabatino. Well, thank you for the question, Congressman. Certainly bringing on incrementally is the best effort for us in terms of feasibility because of the training requirements. But the resource support also for our mission-support personnel, our training capacity, technology is also-- investments in technology is very important to us. We do appreciate Congress' continued investment in nonintrusive inspection technology, again, all part of our modernization efforts to enhance operations at the border and, again, put our officers back to doing what they do best, which is situational awareness. Mr. Ivey. On the technology piece--and I appreciate you raising that--when we went down to the border, one of the issues that came up was drones, and what we were told by some of the officers was that the cartels were using drones, and they had more, and I guess better, than we do down there. Now, that was like 6 or 7 months ago that we were down there, maybe longer, but I wanted to get your sense of what you're seeing about drones, you know, and if we're able to match what the cartels are doing with those. Ms. Sabatino. I certainly would have to defer to the subject-matter expertise of our Office of Air and Marine Operations. Though there are very sophisticated efforts by the cartels to leverage drones, to counter our operations and smuggle things across the border. Mr. Ivey. OK. One other question too, I think with respect to judges--and that's the process of immigration judges, and that may be outside of your purview--but just from the standpoint of trying to expedite the process where these cases are resolved, so after they get from your baileywick and moved down the road, adding new judges, I mean, what kind of--do you know, if you know--what kind of backlog are they facing with respect to these cases, and, you know, what sort of additional resources would we need to address that? Mr. Hunter. Mr. Ranking Member, the immigration judges are with the Department of Justice Executive Office of Immigration Review, but you are right to observe that there are millions of cases in backlog there, and that's why cases may take 5 to 8 years. As you've invoked earlier, sir, the bipartisan Senate bill would give us new authorities and resources within the Department of Homeland Security and our asylum core to bring that time down, if fully implemented, to 6 or 7 months. Mr. Ivey. I apologize for running over, Mr. Chairman, but thank you, and I yield back. Mr. Higgins. The gentleman yields. I recognize Mr. Luttrell, the gentleman from Texas, for 5 minutes. We're going to be calling recess after Mr. Luttrell's questioning--yes, we have time. After the gentleman from Texas questions, we're going to have to go into recess for votes. Mr. Luttrell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hunter, I'm going to piggyback on what Mr. Ivey asked you about, about the smugglers and how the CBP One app--let's just make believe I've never been in a foreign country, operating in a threat environment, maybe in this same space. But can you assure us that--and I've been to Mexico quite a bit--can you assure us that those migrants that are coming up through the country, that are accessing the CBP One app are not in any way in a marshaling area, under command and control, and then handed their device to move forward and then tracked while they're in country for whatever reason, either a coordinated movement inside the country or a plot to do something specific? You know, my concern is, when it comes to the AI space and how--you know, you can say nefarious actors, you can say whatever you want, but that exists--so are we sure that the CBP One app is secured? Because I can assure you, if you tried hard enough, I could probably tell you every single phone number in your phone if you gave me about 30 minutes. Mr. Hunter. Thank you, Congressman, for the question. With the smugglers and the cartels, we in the Department will never say never because they are resourced, and they are motivated, and they are making a profit at the expense of migrants. What I can say is, what we are doing through CBP One is trying to cut out the smugglers at every step we can. So by putting more power in the hands of the individual migrants to schedule their appointment, we're taking that power away from the smuggling organizations who have tended to use large groups and to enter between ports of entry. So we're giving a pathway for migrants to have an alternative so they're not required to work with the smugglers on that irregular entry. Mr. Luttrell. Does it seem like the individuals that are coming through the port of entry on the CBP One app fall in any specific categories? Fighting-age males? Is this something that we're monitoring? Ms. Sabatino. Ms. Sabatino. Thank you for the question, but the demographics change, even port by port. We can certainly provide an overview of what the demographics are, and I think a fulsome briefing really on what the security measures are. It would probably take too long in this hearing, but to really walk through individually what those security measures are for the enhancement and to ensure like geolocation is only pinged to that phone when an individual, just to determine where they are at the time that they tried to opt in or schedule that appointment. Mr. Luttrell. OK. Ms. Meckley, can I make the assessment that you are the subject-matter expert on immigration and immigration policy? Ms. Meckley. I would not. Mr. Luttrell. Is anybody on that panel? Ms. Meckley. I would say Mr. Hunter. Mr. Luttrell. Would you? All right. Your lucky day, sir. My dear friend, Mrs. Ramirez, and I chat quite a bit, and I wish Mr. Garcia was here because he often holds up a white board with the immigration policy on it, and it's absolutely horrific. I'm curious if the Department, if anybody on your side has, in any way, tried to restructure the immigration policy so it is more streamlined to present to us in any recent memory? Or did she just completely throw you under the bus? Mr. Hunter. No, I'm happy to take the question, Congressman, and my colleagues from USCIS. If you're asking, Congressman, our immigration policies, our immigration law, our framework is complicated, is outdated, and is a patchwork. Mr. Luttrell. So are you telling me that or asking me? Mr. Hunter. No, I'm affirming that. Mr. Luttrell. OK, good, all right, we agree. Mr. Hunter. Yes--and has been outdated to provide the flexibility and tools that we need in the 21st Century. Mr. Luttrell. True. Are you waiting on us to write it up here, or are you guys going to---- Mr. Hunter. Well, we have. So I know the President did submit a bill very early in the administration that outlined some reforms, and there was collaboration and technical assistance provided on the bipartisan Senate measure just 2 months ago, which really squarely gets at this issue of the asylum backlog and the resources we need to bring that down, which will disincentivize people from arriving who have nonmeritorious claims. Mr. Luttrell. Well, just considering you and your organization and those underneath you--I may not be talking directly to the person, but I bet you know who it is. You are the subject-matter experts. Amongst everything else that we deal with in the House of Representatives, we look to you for answers and guidance. I think that's a fair assessment. It would be--and I am going to speak for Morgan on this one--if you came to my office with a revised immigration policy plan, I would be happy to look at it. I will walk across the hall to her office and say, what do you think? Then she and I would beat each other up, and then we would probably come to another agreement, come back and beat you up a little bit, and then the process is started, instead of us beating each other up every single, solitary day about immigration policy and border security, and then when we walk out of this meeting, nothing happens. But that time is--absolutely needs to go bye-bye. So I'm actually putting the basketball in your court, sir, and I'd be happy to revisit if you'd be happy to schedule a meeting with me and that young lady over there--I'm sorry, I'm speaking for you. You're welcome. Mr. Hunter. Congressman, we in the Department, would be delighted to---- Mr. Luttrell. Perfect. Mr. Hunter . Meet with you and other Members of the committee on substantive reform. Mr. Luttrell. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Higgins. The gentleman yields. I recognize Mr. Suozzi from New York for 5 minutes for questions, and then--and then the gentleman's name--he knows I'm from Louisiana. It's a difficult name. Mr. Suozzi. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Luttrell, before you go, I want to be in on that meeting. I want to invite Mr. Bishop and Mr. Ivey as well to come to that meeting, and I want to use the bipartisan Senate bill as a framework for us to start our conversation. So you said, Mr. Hunter, in your testimony that you removed or returned nearly 600,000 individuals this year. Mr. Hunter. Congressman, thank you for the question. It's actually been more. It was 630,000 just in the past 10 months. Mr. Suozzi. So do you think that we could remove or return many, many more people if we had more border agents, more immigration judges, more detention beds, and revised policy as proposed in the Senate bipartisan bill? Mr. Hunter. Yes, Congressman. If there are more individuals who are not--who under their--excuse me--who do not have the legal basis to remain in the country, then we have the capacity to remove. Mr. Suozzi. So there are many people that don't have a legal basis to be here. We conjecture, based upon the fact that you said earlier 70 percent of the people would be denied asylum if they were properly processed. I've numbers as high as 80 or 90 percent. So, you know, we keep on hearing about the 5,000 people a day, 5,000 people a day. We don't want 5,000 people a day coming under the bipartisan Senate proposal. But those would be 5,000 applicants for asylum. If they were properly processed, with the proper number of immigration judges, proper number of border security agents, proper number of detention beds, and revised policy that's been proposed in the bipartisan Senate proposal, then 90 percent of those 5,000--let's say 80 percent or 70 percent, using your number before, but I've heard 90 percent--would be, in fact, returned within 6 months instead of going through a 3-year, 4-year, 5- year, 8-year process. Is that correct? Mr. Hunter. Generally speaking, Congressman, that's my understanding. Mr. Suozzi. So unlike what Mr. Bishop said before, the purpose of processing more people is not to let more people into the country. The purpose of processing more cases with more judges, more border security agents, more detention beds, and a better process is to actually deny the cases that will ultimately be denied but now takes 3, 5, 9 years to get done. If we did it in 6 months, 70 to 90 percent of those people would be returned in a very short period of time and would never be released into the country, because they'd actually be processed at the facility while staying in detention facilities. Is that correct? Mr. Hunter. So, Congressman, what I'd underscore is, you know, we value our ability to welcome and accept asylum in this country---- Mr. Suozzi. We all do, we all do, but right now that system is being corrupted by the cartels that we hear about all the time, people that are getting paid $7- to $10,000 per person in a multi-billion enterprise, and they are corrupting our system by telling people, Hey, make sure you say this, make sure you say that. Then because of our wonderful nature of the United States of America, these people are being put through a process, but that process is taking too damn long. It's taking 3 years, 5 years, 9 years. We want to fix that process--instead of just arguing about it here, we want to fix that process, we want to process the cases, and we want to return 70 to 90 percent of the people in a short period of time. So I want to take Mr. Luttrell up. I want to invite Mr. Bishop. I want to invite Mr. Ivey. I want to invite anybody else who wants to come. Let's start with the Senate bipartisan compromise that was negotiated by Ms. Sinema, and Mr. Murphy and a wonderful gentleman from Oklahoma, who I think is very conservative, ethical, honest, and hardworking, Mr. Lankford. Let's use that as a basis, and let's use that framework that was negotiated over a 4-month period, and let's find an answer to this problem. Instead of just fighting about it over and over again, let's actually do our jobs and fix it, and let's process these cases, deport the people that should be deported and treat the other people that deserve to come to the United States of America under our historic generosity to the world, and let them in. But the rest of them, let's stop them from breaking the rules, and let's get them out. But to do that, Ms. Sabatino needs the resources, Ms. Meckley needs the resources, the Department of State needs the resources, you need the resources. You need border agents, you need immigration judges, you need detention beds, and you need a refined process that will stop people from breaking the system, breaking the rules. So we can do it. It's pretty straightforward. I'm new to Congress, I just got here recently, but I've been watching TV, and we're all freaking out when we see what's going on at the border, all these people coming every day. It's driving us crazy. People are freaking out. Democrats and Republicans and independents are worried about the broken system, and it's because of the fact--not because Joe Biden and the Executive--COVID's over. There was a surge before COVID under President Trump if you remember. Remember the whole thing with kids in the cages and stuff? There was a surge before COVID. It went down during COVID. There was a surge again once COVID was relieved. There's more refugees in the world as Ms. Youth pointed out. There's 110 million refugees, displaced persons, and asylum seekers, in the world now, the biggest number since World War II by quadruple. People are fleeing misery, and they'll do whatever it takes to try to come to the greatest country in the world, the United States of America. We got to fix the process that's designed to deal with 400,000 people a year, not 2\1/2\ million people a year. Let's work together. Let's fix the problem. Let's do our jobs. Thank you very much for your testimony today. I appreciate you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Higgins. The committee going to go into recess, and we'll reconvene 5 minutes after votes for Members who return. We thank the panelists for your patience. The committee is now in recess.   Mr. Higgins. The committee is reconvened. Thank you for your patience. Ladies and gentlemen, you've been quite tolerant of the impossible-to-anticipate, House voting schedule. My colleague, Mr. Brecheen is recognized for 5 minutes for questioning. Mr. Brecheen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So something we've gone down before, talking about the CBP One app, it was created of course in 2020, in October, and then the app was utilized by this administration to be increased. Originally the app was to alleviate the wait times for cargo inspection at ports, but then Secretary Mayorkas, Mr. Hunter, made the decision to let aliens schedule border appointments with the app, starting in 2022, 2023. Over 95 percent now of the 459,000 aliens who have arrived at port of entry have been paroled and released into the country--95 percent of those who apply. That's important to note. In addition, CBP One has been used to fly 386,000 foreign nationals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela into U.S. airports. I want to just pause, because I think when the news of this last couple weeks broke that 386,000 foreign nationals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela, got on a plane, flown into the United States, I think Democrat, Republican, the average American said, You've got to be kidding me. Secretary Mayorkas claims that this wide-spread use of the CBP One app is good because it supposedly reduces illegal border crossings. In reality, the Biden administration is simply shifting the flow of illegals from between ports of entry to this new process, this, quote, modern process. Let's really be clear. We're talking about inadmissible aliens. Just think about the term. You guys use it. I know you're using the term ``migrant'' also often a lot. I'm not trying to be flippant. I think it's really sad that we've moved to a place, we're trying to confuse the American people and call these people migrants. Mr. Hunter, no offense intended, but I think it's really sad that we're wordsmithing. They're illegal aliens. You guys still continue to use the word ``inadmissible'' because that's supposed to mean something. This is illegal. So to talk about how the CBP One app has caused people not to go to ports of entry and what--many times they were being turned away. Now they're not. Ninety-five percent of those who use the app are released into the United States. Just compare some year differences. Those who used to go to the ports of entry that were inadmissible aliens, 115,000 per month now in 2024, compared to 20,000 in 2020. So 115,000 now are going to the ports of entry compared to 20,000 in 2020. Why? Because of the marketing campaign of the Biden administration. When we use the term, there's, you know, 110 million migrants, somebody tell me the tsunami that hit South America that I missed that was in the news. I tell you what's happened. Man, it's hard not to be flippant when you just--the American people know that they are being hoodwinked by this administration on this, y'all. There wasn't--there's not 110 million--that's one-third of the population of the United States, migrants that have had this migrant--they're coming because President Biden put a marketing campaign out when he took office and said, come on in illegally. That's truth. There's not been this massive hurricane that's hit South America. South America's not under water. People are coming here because our laws are not standing for truth anymore. All right. Ms. Meckley, under the CHNV parole program, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services States that after an alien receives advance travel authorization to the United States, the alien is responsible for securing their own travel via air to international airport--to the international airport in the United States. How does the U.S. Government determine who provides the funding for aliens' airfare to the United States? Let me ask it a different way. We've got NGO's, nongovernment organizations, that are helping people break the laws. It's ridiculous. Can you guarantee this body that funding from the U.S. taxpayer, through NGO's, is not helping sponsor people? The 386,000 people that have been flown into the interior of the United States, can you guarantee this body, U.S. taxpayers, in addition to this madness of them not doing regular process, flown in from their country into the United States, that the U.S. taxpayer inadvertently through NGO's is not paying for that? Ms. Meckley. Sir, my role at USCIS is to oversee the reviews of the I-134A process. So I am responsible for the execution of that part of helping facilitate the information getting to CBP for them to make the parole determinations. As we do that, when we review the 134A, part of that review is looking at evidence for how the supporter will provide financial and other support to that beneficiary should CBP decide to parole that individual into the United States. Mr. Brecheen. I need to do this just because of my time. Yes or no, can you guarantee the taxpayer that they're not footing the bill for bringing these--for the flight cost of bringing these people in through NGO's? Ms. Meckley. Sir, I don't know whether or not it is. As I'm saying, is we review the 134A, and they have to provide financial documentation that says they can support that individual during and throughout the parole validity period. Mr. Brecheen. Yes. Mr. Chairman, I'm going to yield back to you, but I'll just note that there's no confidence in this administration that NGO funding, that the taxpayer is not picking up the $500 to $1,000 per flight expense to fly them in also. Mr. Higgins. The gentleman yields. The gentleman, our colleague, Mr. Crane, is recognized for 5 minutes for questioning. Mr. Crane. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to start with you, Mr. Hunter. You made some statements today talking about the causation of this crisis that we see at our Southern Border. You cited poverty, corruption, climate change, to name a few. Is that correct? I want to run by some actual quotes from President Biden for you real quick. On September 12, 2019, then-candidate Biden said, We're a Nation who says if you want to flee and you're fleeing oppression, you should come. Did you hear him say that, sir? Yes or no? Mr. Hunter. I didn't specifically hear that quote. Mr. Crane. OK. Thank you. On June 27, 2019, candidate Biden: Those who come seeking asylum, we should immediately have the capacity to absorb them, keep them safe. Did you hear him say that? Mr. Hunter. I don't specifically recall that quote, sir. Mr. Crane. OK. Would you agree with those statements, though, that we should absorb them, that we should have the capacity to absorb them, we should do that? Mr. Hunter. Congressman, we're required under law to inspect individuals who present, and individuals do have the right to seek asylum in the United States. Mr. Crane. So would you alter--would you add that to your list now that we've gone over that, that it wasn't just pot-- it's not poverty, corruption, climate change, a tsunami, like my friend here, Mr. Brecheen was talking about? Do you think that 1 of 2 people that could've been the President of the United States, the leader of the free world, saying that to the entire country and to the entire world during, you know, a television hearing, do you think that had anything to do with what we're seeing now at the Southern Border? Mr. Hunter. Congressman, it sounds like there is a recognition that there are people who are fleeing persecution, and in my reference to the particular governments--Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela--there are individuals who are fleeing persecution under those regimes. Mr. Crane. OK. So--but it does--one of the leaders of the free world said, Hey, if you want to come here, you should come, right? So that's really what's really going on here. That's what my friend, Mr. Brecheen, was talking about. That's what many people are talking about up here. You know, this isn't the, you know, global climate movement that many of my colleagues on the other side are trying to make it out to be. A lot of what it is, is globalism, sir. There are a lot of people around the world that are very, very powerful, and they don't want anybody to have borders. They want globalism. World Economic Forum is one of them. That's what, unfortunately, what many of our leaders actually take their cue from. What do you guys have to say to Americans who are living in fear every day of another terrorist attack? Let's start with you, Ms. Sabatino. Ms. Sabatino. No. Thank you for the question. We invest significant resources, starting with our National Targeting Center, which also plays a significant role in the screening and vetting of individuals, whether they are through these processes or any individuals arriving to the United States. Mr. Crane. What do you guys have to say to Americans who have seen their schools, hospitals, and community spaces overtaken by migrants? Do you guys--you get a chance. You are on TV right now. Do you guys have anything to say to them? What about do you have anything to say to Americans who are afraid that the cartels are taking over their towns? How about anything to say to Americans who have lost their children to fentanyl? Do you have anything to say to them? Go ahead, Mr. Hunter. Mr. Hunter. Congressman, in regards to the irregular migration challenges, it is a singular focus of our Department to reduce irregular migration in the hemisphere and unlawful entry. Mr. Crane. OK, well, thank you for that, but you are doing a horrible job, and the American people know it. OK? I mean, you guys are doing the worst job in the history of this country. So the fact that you even answered that as if that's your responsibility just it shows me--tells me how detached from reality you absolutely are. Mr. Hunter, where were you on 9/11, sir? Do you remember where you were? Mr. Hunter. I do, indeed, Congressman. I was working in Washington, DC, at a NGO on Dupont Circle at the time. Mr. Crane. What about you, Ms. Sabatino? Where were you? Ms. Sabatino. I was an immigration inspector at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Mr. Crane. You remember exactly where you were that day? Ms. Sabatino. I do. Mr. Crane. Ma'am, what about you? Do you remember? Ms. Meckley. Yes. I worked for the executive office for the U.S. Attorney's Department of Justice. Mr. Crane. Ms. Youth. Ms. Youth. I was serving in Madrid at the time, but I was in Geneva at a training. Mr. Crane. OK. Well, the reason I asked you guys that, do you remember what Americans were saying right after that? Do you remember what Americans were saying? Do you remember them saying, never again? We're never going to let this happen again? Do you guys remember that? Yes or no? Go ahead, Ms. Youth. Do you remember Americans saying that? Ms. Youth. Yes, sir. Mr. Crane. Ms. Meckley. Ms. Meckley. Yes, sir. Mr. Crane. Ms. Sabatino. Ms. Sabatino. Yes. Mr. Crane. Well, guess what, guys? It is going to happen again. It is not a question of if. It is a question of when. For every one of you guys that have sat by and supported these policies and these tools that we are talking about today that have allowed an expedited--this mass migration into the United States, you are going to share a little bit of that ownership. All right? That changed so many of our lives forever. We said never again. Here we are implementing policies and tools that are making it so easy for individuals who don't love this country, who want to do harm to this country--and we are not talking about everybody. We know there are plenty of people who just want to come here for a better life. But you guys all know there are plenty of people in this country right now that want to do Americans harm. This is my question for you, and we don't have time to answer it. But I want you to think about this. When the next major attack like 9/11 or a series of 9/11s happen in this country, will you still continue to support these policies and these tools? Because we're not going to forget it. We're not going to forget who was at the helm. We're not going to forget who was in these positions. We're not going to forget the policies. We're not going to forget the tools, and we're not going to forget the committee hearings like we had today where you guys could have condoned this administration and you guys didn't. All right. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Higgins. The gentleman yields. The gentlewoman, Ms. Greene, is recognized for 5 minutes of questioning. Ms. Greene. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Crane, for pointing out the most important things that people outside of this city talk about. While you all are paid with a taxpayer-funded paycheck, I want you to know that most Americans are concerned exactly about what Mr. Crane talked about. There's also many Americans, like in my home State of Georgia, that are still grieving the death of a young woman named Laken Riley who was brutally murdered by an illegal alien that came into this country in Venezuela, who had injured a child in New York and was not deported. In my district, fentanyl is a real problem. It's a serious problem. Fentanyl doesn't discriminate based on politics or identity, sexual orientation, or race. Fentanyl is killing people every single day. It's also something that's extremely concerning for everyone in my district. This is such an outrage to most Americans. Again, they pay all of our paychecks with their hard-earned tax dollars that our country is under invasion. It is an invasion. Now, while we believe that people should legally immigrate to America and follow the laws, all of our laws are being completely broken. The fact that over 10 million people have come into our country, and there are 2 million gotaways on your watch, 2 million gotaways that are capable of doing something like Mr. Crane just talked about, a terrorist attack or the daily crime committed against innocent Americans, whether it's a tragic car accident that kills Americans in the car, whether it is a fentanyl poisoning, a murder that comes--the fentanyl comes from China to Mexico and come into our country, or whether it's a brutal murder like what happened to Laken Riley, it's happening every single day. The CBP One app is the most fascinating thing to me. While Congress just banned TikTok, we have this app that our Government funds that shocking statistics, more than 459,000 individuals have scheduled Southwest Border appointments with the CBP One app since January 2023, and 96 percent of those scheduled appointments with the app were issued and a notice to appear and paroled into the country. Ninety-six percent. The CBP One app is like a welcoming app. Welcome to America. Come on in. You aren't vetting people. We've heard from witnesses before our committee. We heard from one mother whose daughter was horrifically raped and murdered, and the man that raped and murdered her daughter had gang tattoos, cartel tattoos all over him. He was allowed in the country, and he brutally raped and murdered her daughter, and her daughter's boyfriend still has the voicemail on his phone of her last 2 minutes of life while she was calling him in panic. That voicemail is her being raped and murdered. This is what our country is dealing with, and it seems to fall on deaf ears when we talk to witnesses like you. It's unbelievable. Ms. Sabatino, according to DHS, applicants for the CHNV program, ``undergo a clear and robust security vetting''. A clear and robust security vetting. In order to obtain advance travel authorization through CHNV parole program, an individual provides biometric information, including a photograph using the CBP One app. Now, on our committee--well, they're all gone--there are Democrats that assigned a letter, literally signed a letter saying that it's unfair, completely unfair that transgender migrants have to provide a photo. That's unfair to them, and they would like to take away the photo requirement on the CBP One app. Are all individuals in the CHNV parole process required to submit biographical information through CBP One? Ms. Sabatino. Biographic and biometric. It's the photo. Ms. Greene. Can you imagine not having a photo? Ms. Sabatino. The facial biometric matching is a significant security enhancement to the CBP One app. Ms. Greene. Are you keeping criminals out of our country with the CBP One app? Ms. Sabatino. The CBP One app really is just a tool to move the information, but we are taking the biographic and biometric information and matching it against watch list, our law enforcement databases, travel data, criminal records, as well as our derogatory photo index. Ms. Greene. So do you sleep good at night? Like, do you know for a fact that you're keeping these criminals out of our country with the CBP One app? You're confident that you're keeping out rapists, murderers, cartel members, terrorists? You're confident that you're keeping them out of our country? Ms. Sabatino. Congresswoman, as a 26-year career employee, I'm very well aware of the challenges that we are up against, and I sleep well knowing that our CBP officers and front-line personnel are doing their level best to protect the American communities. Ms. Greene. So the CBP One app processes the information and expedites people from over 160 countries around the world into our country, and you sleep good at night, and you're confident in the CBP One app? Ms. Sabatino. The CBP One app doesn't expedite individuals. It actually affords advance information to our officers to do that robust vetting and screening and the facial--obtaining the photos to do the facial biometric match to our derog index. Ms. Greene. So you don't think already having the information in an app with the photo when the migrants can come and pick a--select a date and time to come meet with Border Patrol, that doesn't expedite the process? You're saying that's not an expedition of the process? Ms. Sabatino. I think I can highlight a number of instances over the last 10 years where migrants showing up at our ports of entry without any advance information quickly overwhelm our teams and then redirect our teams from doing things like interdicting fentanyl or outbound operations, seizing weapons and currency that funds the cartels. We have a lot of different disciplines and responsibilities at the ports of entry. Without that streamlined process, we would be solely focused on processing individuals who are required to afford the opportunity to request asylum at our ports of entry. Ms. Greene. Sure. So maybe thousands of people showing up at one time at a port of entry or at the border along the way would be considered an invasion. That's what most Americans are calling it. Most Americans are against the fact that their taxpayer dollars are having to pay for a handy dandy app that people can download and enter the information so they can be expedited into America. It's outrageous. Mr. Chairman, I am going to go ahead and yield. Thank you. Mr. Higgins. The gentlelady yields. The Chair has been quite generous with time today to both sides of the aisle. I'm happy to recognize the Ranking Member. Mr. Correa. I'm going to pass. Mr. Higgins. Any response? We have agreed to submit further questions in writing, panelists, out of respect for your time. You've been here all day and quite patient with interruptions of anticipated schedule. So I thank the witnesses for their testimony and the Members for their questions. The Members of the subcommittees may have additional questions for the witnesses, and we would ask the witnesses to respond to these in writing. Pursuant to committee rule VII(D), the hearing record will be held open for 10 days. Without objection, the subcommittees stand adjourned.  A P P E N D I X I ---------- Questions From Chairman Mark E. Green, MD for Adam Hunter Question 1. Who made the decision to transition the CBP One app from a commercial application to a migrant/immigration processing tool? Was the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans included in discussions with Secretary Mayorkas on the expansion of CBP One? Answer. On January 5, 2023, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced new border enforcement measures, to include the use of the CBP One mobile application for noncitizens to schedule appointments to present themselves at ports of entry (POEs), facilitating a safe, orderly, and lawful migration management process. Initially, DHS used this functionality for noncitizens seeking a humanitarian exception to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Title 42 public health order. Once Title 42 ended by operation of law on May 12, 2023, noncitizens seeking entry to the United States were able to use CBP One to schedule an appointment to present at certain POEs across the Southwest Border (SWB) to help ensure safe and orderly processing. This decision was made by Department leadership in coordination with all impacted offices, including the DHS Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans. The advance biographic and biometric information the noncitizens provide in CBP One to secure their appointment allows U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to streamline their screening and vetting processes of these noncitizens at POEs. The efficiency gained by noncitizens' use of the CBP One scheduling function allowed CBP to significantly expand its capacity to process noncitizens more efficiently at land POEs on the SWB compared to pre-pandemic processing. Question 2a. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regularly puts out English tweets about the consequences for coming to the United States illegally. However, in a Spanish interview with Univision Miami, Assistant Secretary Nunez-Neto seemed intent on letting the audience know that the ``lottery'' (meaning CBP One) will give people hope that their application will be reviewed, and that this application will allow them to get into the United States faster. Does the Department's messaging to illegal aliens regularly expressing the ease in which aliens can ``schedule'' their arrival in the United States with the app, act as a pull factor or an invitation for illegal migration? Question 2b. Since January 2023, how many aliens, who use the CBP One app to schedule their arrival at a Southwest Border port of entry, also apply for and are qualified to receive asylum? Answer. CBP One is used only as a scheduling tool for those who have decided to seek admission at a port of entry (POE). The application is not a tool to request parole or claim asylum, nor is it used to screen, inspect, or process noncitizens for entry to the United States. The tool simply allows individuals of any nationality who in certain parts of Mexico to schedule an appointment to present themselves at a designated land POE. The advance biographic and biometric information that individuals provide in CBP One to secure their appointment allows CBP to streamline its screening and vetting processes at the POE, where the noncitizens may then be placed into immigration proceedings. The noncitizen may seek asylum during the course of their immigration proceedings, where their asylum claim will be evaluated. DHS has been clear--there are safe, lawful, and orderly pathways to come to the United States, and consequences for those who do not use them. Those who come lawfully will be able to stay in the United States for the time that they are authorized to be here and may be granted employment authorization, while those who come unlawfully will be subject to strengthened consequences and may be quickly removed. From May 12, 2023 to April 3, 2024, DHS has removed or returned over 660,000 individuals, the vast majority of whom crossed the SWB, including more than 102,000 individuals who arrived as members of family units or groups. Total removals and returns since mid-May exceed removals and returns in every full fiscal year since 2011. Questions From Chairman Clay Higgins for Adam Hunter Question 1. DHS initially launched CBP One in 2020 to streamline inspections of commercial goods, such as perishable cargo. However, in 2023 the Biden administration decided to expand CBP One's capabilities that would attract an unlimited number of inadmissible aliens to the United States. Why did the Department decide to open the flood gates to include appointments for these inadmissible aliens? Answer. The advance biographic and biometric information individuals provide in CBP One to secure their appointment allows CBP to streamline its processing at the border, including screening and vetting processes. The efficiency gained by noncitizens' use of the CBP One scheduling function, as opposed to simply presenting themselves to seek admission, has allowed CBP to significantly expand its capacity to process noncitizens more efficiently at land POEs on the SWB compared to pre-pandemic processing. DHS has been clear--there are safe, lawful, and orderly pathways and processes to come to the United States, and consequences for those who do not use them. Those who come lawfully will be able to stay in the United States for the time that they are authorized to be here and may be granted employment authorization, while those who come unlawfully will be subject to strengthened consequences and quickly removed. Question 2a. Aliens are generally inadmissible to the United States based on certain health-related grounds (INA 212(a)) and by law, aliens are generally required to undergo a medical examination before entering the United States. Are aliens who use CBP One to either schedule an appointment at a port of entry or who are part of the Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan (CHNV) parole program required to undergo medical examinations and a vaccination report? Question 2b. If so, please describe the extent of the examination and vaccination report. Answer. Before traveling to the United States, noncitizens using the Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan (CHNV) parole processes must comply with established requirements, including vaccination requirements and other public health guidelines, and confirm that they meet public health requirements. Noncitizens seeking travel authorization through the CHNV processes must attest as part of the process that they have completed vaccine requirements or are eligible for an exception to vaccine requirements for measles, polio, and the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine approved or authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or Emergency Use Listed by the World Health Organization. Within 90 days of arrival to the United States, noncitizens seeking travel authorization through the CHNV processes must attest that they have undergone screening for tuberculosis. CBP One is merely a scheduling tool, and is not used to screen, inspect, or process noncitizens for entry into the United States; noncitizens who present at the POE with or without a CBP One appointment undergo Office of Field Operations processing at the POE. Questions From Vice Chairman Michael Guest for Adam Hunter Question 1a. In October 2023, the committee received information on CBP One after multiple requests and the threat of a subpoena. These documents revealed that nearly 96 percent of inadmissible aliens who scheduled appointments to present at Southwest Border ports of entry were issued a Notice to Appear and released into the United States on parole. Why were nearly 96 percent of those who made appointments at 1 of the 8 Southwest Border ports of entry paroled, rather than placed into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody for detention? Answer. Upon arrival at the POE, individuals are inspected by CBP and required to submit additional information, to include fingerprints, for further biometric vetting. CBP officers retain discretion to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether or not each noncitizen is eligible for parole or another lawful pathway. Noncitizens who are determined to pose a potential national security or public safety threat, or otherwise do not warrant parole as a matter of discretion upon inspection, will be processed under an appropriate processing pathway and may be referred to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for a custody determination. Question 1b. What are the determining factors for placing an individual on a ``case-by-case'' basis on parole given that nearly 96 percent of those who made appointments were paroled? Answer. Noncitizens encountered by CBP are processed under Title 8 authorities as required by law. CBP officers retain discretion to determine eligibility for parole on a case-by-case basis given the totality of the circumstances presented in each individual case. Noncitizens are vetted and screened using information available at that time to identify potential threats to national security or public safety. As noted above, those determined to pose a potential threat, or who otherwise do not warrant parole as a matter of discretion, will be processed under an appropriate processing pathway and may be referred to ICE for a custody determination. Question 1c. How many aliens of the 96 percent who were granted entry into the United States via the app, claimed asylum after they arrived at a port of entry? Answer. As noted above, CBP One is used only as a scheduling tool. The application is not a tool to request parole or claim asylum, nor is it used to screen, inspect, or process noncitizens for entry to the United States. The tool simply allows individuals of any nationality who are in certain parts of Mexico to schedule an appointment to present themselves at a designated land POE. The advance biographic and biometric information individuals provide in CBP One to secure their appointment allows CBP to streamline its processing at the border, including screening and vetting processes. The efficiency gained by noncitizens' use of the CBP One scheduling functionality has allowed CBP to significantly expand its capacity to process noncitizens more efficiently at land POEs on the SWB compared to pre-pandemic processing. As noted above, noncitizens who present with CBP One appointments are placed in immigration proceedings. Those who are issued Notices to Appear in removal proceedings or who receive a positive fear determination from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) would present any requests for relief--such as asylum--to the immigration judge. Accordingly, questions regarding the number of individuals who eventually make such requests should be directed to the U.S. Department of Justice. Questions From Ranking Member J. Luis Correa for Adam Hunter Question 1. Mr. Hunter, it's been suggested that the U.S. Government is paying for the plane tickets of individuals granted parole through the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV) parole program. As part of the parole process, the non-citizens of these countries who apply for parole through this program must have a U.S.- based supporter confirmed by USCIS, and they must submit certain information to be screened and vetted to be considered for travel authorization. Can you confirm that once an individual meets all the requirements of this program and is deemed safe for travel to the United States, that the individuals or their sponsors pay for the plane tickets to travel to the United States and that the U.S. Government does not pay for these plane tickets? Answer. If approved to travel to the United States through the CHNV parole processes, individuals are responsible for arranging their own travel via air to an interior POE in the United States, rather than arriving at the SWB. The U.S. Government does not pay or arrange travel for noncitizens to the United States through the CHNV parole process. Question 2a. For all witnesses, as we face the largest global mass migration of individuals this world has ever seen the strength of our global partnerships has never been more important. This is not just a U.S. issue, it's a global issue. Shared challenges require shared solutions, and we must continue to work with our partners around the globe to address the migration issues we are seeing. We also know that with these challenges the risk to our national security is elevated. We cannot forget that the 9/11 hijackers were here in the United States on tourist and business visas and there has not been a terrorist attack on the United States from an undocumented migrant. We must look broader than the people asking for protection at our border. As we continue to use all of the tools in our toolkit to create a more humane, safe, and orderly immigration system, we must remain vigilant to maintain our national security. Can you describe what your agency partnerships are like with our closest partners in Mexico and Canada as well as with countries in the Western Hemisphere? Answer. DHS works with countries throughout the hemisphere-- including, but not limited to, Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama--to expand efforts to counter human smuggling organizations, humanely secure borders, share information, increase labor mobility, and expand protection and lawful pathways. The government of Mexico (GOM) continues to be a leader in the region when it comes to innovative and balanced efforts to manage migration. DHS developed an innovative approach that provided certain CHNV nationals with a safe, orderly way to come to the United States and imposed new consequences on those who crossed unlawfully. As a result of close coordination with the GOM, CHNV nationals who do not use these new processes and are encountered at the land border may be returned or removed to Mexico. In March 2023, the United States and Canada announced coordination on efforts to incentivize lawful migration processes and reduce irregular migration, including an Additional Protocol to the 2002 U.S.- Canada Safe Third Country Agreement to reduce asylum claims between land POEs, expanding new lawful pathways to Canada, and investments in capacity-building and programming in the region to support migration management and humanitarian protection. DHS also launched a 2-month coordinated campaign with Panama and Colombia to deter the illicit movement of people through the Darien region. In addition, the United States has expanded lawful pathways to the United States and encouraged partner countries to do the same, disincentivizing tens of thousands of migrants and refugees from pursuing irregular migration via the Darien. In close coordination with the U.S. Department of State (DOS), DHS announced the Safe Mobility Initiative to establish offices in Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Ecuador that streamlines access to lawful pathways to the United States and other countries, including expedited refugee processing and various humanitarian and employment opportunities. Throughout the region, DHS and DOS are working bilaterally with numerous partner countries to encourage the strengthening of visa policies, better and more targeted screening of individuals flying into the hemisphere, and enhanced capture and exchange of biometric and biographic data. All these efforts, when taken together, represent significant strides in managing the extraordinary migration challenge that is facing this hemisphere. The United States remains committed to supporting our partners within Latin America and the Caribbean as they integrate millions of migrants, mostly Venezuelans. Partners throughout the region have offered legal status and integration opportunities to the more than 7.7 million displaced Venezuelans who have fled their country, stabilizing them in the region and preventing further displacement or irregular movement to our border. The United States offers financial and technical assistance to receiving countries that have opened regularization opportunities to displaced migrants. Question 2b. Can you describe how these partnerships help strengthen our national security to help prevent another 9/11 from occurring on our soil again? Answer. DHS collaborates with international and Federal partners to deter irregular migration to ensure that the United States is sharing responsibility throughout the Western Hemisphere. DHS continues to build our partnerships with our foreign partners, to include increasing our information-sharing capabilities and providing capacity-building support. These efforts improve partners' ability to detect criminal and terrorists crossing borders, and improves DHS's ability to vet against foreign data. For example, through the International Biometric Data Sharing Program, DHS is able to conduct a biometric check against its foreign partners' biometric data to authenticate a traveler's identity and quickly receive immigration and criminal history information, as well as indications the individual may represent a national security threat. DHS is also working with governments in the Western Hemisphere to expand the Biometric Data Sharing Partnership, which improves a country's identity management capabilities and establishes biometric information sharing between DHS and the partner country. Through this initiative, DHS trains partners to collect data on migrants and to use data provided by DHS to help identify security risks. Information obtained through these initiatives and other operational partnerships with regional partners assist CBP in identifying and taking appropriate action against noncitizens who pose a national security or public safety threat, and support DHS investigations into transnational criminal activities. Questions From Vice Ranking Member Delia Ramirez for Adam Hunter Question 1a. Regarding the exception to the rebuttable presumption of asylum ineligibility that exists under the ``Circumvention of Lawful Pathways Final Rule'' for people who can demonstrate they are unable to access an appointment through CBP One: How many exceptions have been granted to date? Please provide the supporting data. Answer. In the credible fear context, an Asylum Officer determines whether there is a significant possibility that the noncitizen could establish that they are not subject to the ``Circumvention of Lawful Pathways'' Rule, or that they could establish an exception to or rebut the Rule's presumption of asylum ineligibility. USCIS does not track the specific exception or rebuttal ground a noncitizen is found to have demonstrated. However, since the Rule went into effect on May 12, 2023, up to April 30, 2024, USCIS found that 20,122 noncitizens in credible fear screenings demonstrated a significant possibility that they could establish an exception or rebut the presumption. The final determination on the application of the Rule's presumption of asylum ineligibility is made at the time the asylum application is adjudicated. Question 1b. What are DHS's criteria for granting the exception? Answer. Noncitizens who cross the Southwest land border or adjacent coastal borders of the United States without authorization after traveling through a third country will be presumed ineligible for asylum unless they, or a member of their family with whom they are traveling, meet one of the articulated exceptions: They were provided authorization to travel to the United States pursuant to a DHS-approved parole process; They used the CBP One app to schedule a time and place to present at a POE, or they presented at a POE without using the CBP One app and established that it was not possible to access or use the CBP One app due to a language barrier, illiteracy, significant technical failure, or other on-going and serious obstacle; or They applied for and were denied asylum in a third country en route to the United States. Unaccompanied children are exempted from the rebuttable presumption. Noncitizens can rebut the presumption of asylum ineligibility in exceptionally compelling circumstances, including if they demonstrate that, at the time of their unauthorized entry, they or a member of their family with whom they were traveling: Faced an acute medical emergency; Faced an extreme and imminent threat to their life or safety, such as an imminent threat of rape, kidnapping, torture, or murder; or Were a victim of a severe form of trafficking, as defined in 8 CFR  214.1. Question 1c. How would someone demonstrate they were unable to access an appointment through CBP One? Would not speaking 1 of the 3 languages available on the app or not having access to reliable internet service be sufficient evidence? Answer. As required by regulation, a noncitizen could only be eligible for this exception if they presented at a POE and could demonstrate that it was not possible to access or use the DHS scheduling system due to language barrier, illiteracy, significant technical failure, or other on-going and serious obstacle. The decision about whether an exception applies is made by DHS officials locally based on the totality of the circumstances and evidence presented. Question 2a. The wait times to receive a CBP One appointment remain extremely long and only a few ports of entry accept appointments, which has forced people to wait for months in Mexico, often in dangerous conditions and without the ability to support themselves. What is the United States Government's role in and strategy for ensuring the safety and protection of people waiting for a CBP One appointment? Answer. The U.S. Government continues to work with the GOM to promote the safety and protection of noncitizens waiting in Mexico for a CBP One appointment. Currently, 8 U.S. POEs are available for selection in CBP One to schedule an appointment. Question 2b. What insight does your agency have on the conditions that those who are waiting for an appointment encounter and endure while they stay in Mexico, particularly those who are not Mexican nationals? Question 2c. What coordination is occurring with the government of Mexico to meet the needs of those who are waiting for a CPB One appointment? Answer. DHS respectfully defers to DOS. Question 3. How has your agency consulted with those who have used or could use CBP One to enter the United States, as well as with immigration advocates and services providers, to inform the development of CBP One and U.S. border enforcement efforts? How is your agency engaging with those directly impacted to optimize the app and inform migration policies going forward? Answer. DHS engages extensively at the State and local levels, including with law enforcement entities, public health authorities, and nongovernmental organizations in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as other locations as needed. This regular coordination includes focusing on local transport and capacity planning, resolving logistical challenges, addressing community concerns, and hearing feedback on CBP One and issues impacting POEs. Questions From Chairman Mark E. Green, MD for Diane Sabatino Question 1a. One function of CBP One is to facilitate the Advance Travel Authorization (ATA) for aliens who apply for parole through the CHNV (Cubans, Haitians, Ncaraguans, and Venezuelans) parole program. If granted, this travel authorization allows aliens to fly directly into U.S. airports to be processed for parole. From January 2023 to now, how many aliens have been granted advance travel authorization through the CHNV parole program? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 1b. According to data received from the Department, from October 2022 through June 2023, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) granted parole to 97.5 percent of CHNV applicants. Of the roughly 2.5 percent of CHNV applicants that were denied parole, can you testify that each CHNV applicant that was denied parole has been removed from the country and has not re-entered? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 1c. What are Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) procedures to screen and vet CHNV applicants prior to the issuance of an advance travel authorization? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 1d. When CBP is evaluating CHNV applicants, how does CBP determine an applicant's criminal history? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Questions From Chairman Clay Higgins for Diane Sabatino Question 1a. Despite the app's original intent, cartels have turned CBP One into a lucrative tool, demonstrating the need for continued vigilance and adaptive security measures. What are the current security vulnerabilities in the CBP One app? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 1b. According to several Border Patrol Chiefs, the cartels control the Southwest Border. Is it true that cartels are capitalizing on the app by facilitating entry and charging fees for their services? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 1c. What is CBP doing to combat the cartels from exploiting the CBP One app? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 2a. According to CBP's website, foreign nationals ``located in Central or Northern Mexico . . . may use the CBP One app to submit information in advance and schedule an appointment to present themselves at . . . Southwest Border land ports of entry (POEs).'' Is CBP more concerned with facilitating mass parole or the immigration laws passed by Congress? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 2b. Can you confirm to the American people that CBP hasn't encountered criminals, gang members, or terrorists who have used the app to enter the United States? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 3. CBP has outlined certain exceptions for CBP One allowing some aliens to present at ports of entry without appointments. Why is CBP allowing unauthorized aliens without appointments to circumvent the Department's own rule to present at a Port of Entry? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Questions From Vice Chair Michael Guest for Diane Sabatino Question 1a. The original justification for the roll-out and subsequent expansion of CBP One at ports of entry was to facilitate a safe, orderly, and humane process. However, that has not been the case. The Border Patrol recorded a record of nearly 250,000 enforcement encounters in December 2023. Since January 1, 2023, how many individuals are processed daily at ports of entry, and of those, how many made appointments to schedule their arrival using CBP One? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 1b. Each time the number of appointments increased, who was a part of the discussion on expansion and how was it decided what number to expand to? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 1c. What is the difference in processing inadmissible aliens presenting at ports of entry who made appointments through CBP One and those who did not? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 2a. CBP recently told the committee that they are addressing vulnerabilities in the app's features that might allow foreign nationals to manipulate the appointment scheduling process or app's features. What is CBP doing to ensure that the data that aliens are inputting into the app is accurate? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 2b. Media reports have shown that some aliens have grown frustrated with the app's appointment feature and they often try multiple times a day every day to get an appointment. Is it possible for aliens to create duplicate profile accounts or appointments? Is there a limit to how many appointment submissions can be made in the app? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 2c. What happens to aliens that CBP has caught providing fake information in CBP One? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 2d. Last August, it was reported that cartels were selling virtual private networks (VPN) services to aliens trying to make appointments outside of Northern and Central Mexico. Since then, CBP has said that they have patched this problem. Are there still vulnerabilities in the app that cartels or foreign nations can exploit? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 2e. Have any aliens caught providing fake information been released into the country? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Questions From Honorable Marjorie Taylor Greene for Diane Sabatino Question 1a. To obtain advance travel authorization through the CHNV parole program, an individual provides biometric information, including a photograph, using CBP One. Are all aliens in the CHNV parole process required to submit biographical information through CBP One? Please confirm all the biographical information that is required in the CBP One app prior to be processed by CBP. Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 1b. What other information, if any, are aliens required to submit? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 1c. When vetting for advance travel authorization approval, does CBP vet against criminal records in Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, or Venezuela? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 2. Last year, CBP informed the committee that they were working toward an ``orderly and safe management'' plan to deal with the unprecedented number of aliens surging at the Southwest Border. CBP also noted that the goal of CBP One's scheduling function is to replace paperwork and time consumed by Office of Field Operations (OFO) officers on processing. Is the priority of CBP simply managing the flow of aliens or is it to deter and discourage illegal immigration? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 3a. One criterion to qualify for the CHNV parole program is that the applicant must fly into an interior port of entry. How many airports are aliens, who apply for CHNV, are flying into? Please list the names of all airports that CHNV aliens are flying into. Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 3b. Are any of these airports outside the United States? If so, please list the airports outside of the United States that aliens are flying to. Why are aliens flying into international airports outside the United States? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 3c. Who is responsible for paying for the alien's airline tickets? Can nongovernmental organizations pay for an alien, who applies to and is accepted into, the CHNV parole program, their airline tickets? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 4a. CBP states that it continues to work closely with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as well as U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to quickly process aliens encountered at the border and remove those who do not establish a legal basis to remain in the United States.

Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 4b. What happens to aliens who do not have a legal basis to remain in the United States under DHS's new parole guidelines? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Questions From Ranking Member J. Luis Correa for Diane Sabatino Question 1a. For all witnesses, as we face the largest global mass migration of individuals this world has ever seen, the strength of our global partnerships has never been more important. This is not just a U.S. issue, it's a global issue. Shared challenges require shared solutions, and we must continue to work with our partners around the globe to address the migration issues we are seeing. We also know that with these challenges the risk to our national security is elevated. We cannot forget that the 9/11 hijackers were here in the United States on tourist and business visas and there has not been a terrorist attack on the United States from an undocumented migrant. We must look broader than the people asking for protection at our border. As we continue to use all of the tools in our toolkit to create a more humane, safe, and orderly immigration system, we must remain vigilant to maintain our national security. Can you describe what your agency partnerships are like with our closest partners in Mexico and Canada as well as with countries in the Western Hemisphere? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 1b. Can you describe how these partnerships help strengthen our national security to help prevent another 9/11 from occurring on our soil again? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Questions From Vice Ranking Member Delia Ramirez for Diane Sabatino Question 1.

Ms. Costanzo Youth, your written testimony states the Safe Mobility initiative is one of the ways the United States is facilitating access to safe and lawful pathways from countries in the region, so refugees do not have to undertake a dangerous journey. You state Safe Mobility Offices are currently operational in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Guatemala. Can you clarify what the roles of the Safe Mobility Offices are and what their operations include? Answer. The Safe Mobility initiative is one of the many ways the United States is facilitating access to safe and lawful migration pathways, so refugees and vulnerable migrants don't have to undertake dangerous journeys in search of safety and better opportunities. They access the initiative at no cost through the MovilidadSegura.org website and Safe Mobility Offices (SMOs) in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Guatemala. SMOs complement the range of existing services available for refugees and migrants in host countries. SMOs facilitate expedited refugee processing via the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program as well as provide information and referrals to humanitarian parole, family reunification, and labor pathways. SMOs are also increasing access to information about lawful migration pathways to other countries besides the United States, such as Spain and Canada. Question 2a. For all witnesses, as we face the largest global mass migration of individuals this world has ever seen the strength of our global partnerships has never been more important. This is not just a U.S. issue, it's a global issue. Shared challenges require shared solutions, and we must continue to work with our partners around the globe to address the migration issues we are seeing.

As we continue to use all of the tools in our toolkit to create a more humane, safe, and orderly immigration system, we must remain vigilant to maintain our national security. Can you describe what your agency partnerships are like with our closest partners in Mexico and Canada as well as with countries in the Western Hemisphere? Answer. The Department works with partners in the region to address irregular migration and forced displacement, in line with the shared goals of the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection. We collaborate with Mexico on asylum capacity-building and refugee integration in Mexico, and with Canada via the Comprehensive Regional Protection and Solutions Framework Support Platform, asylum capacity- building in the region, and refugee resettlement. We partner with Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Guatemala to host and operate Safe Mobility offices through our implementing partners to facilitate access to lawful pathways. Question 2b. Can you describe how these partnerships help strengthen our national security to help prevent another 9/11 from occurring on our soil again? Answer. With PRM funding, our humanitarian partners strengthen humane migration management mechanisms and offer local communities the resources they need to host refugees and other vulnerable populations. PRM assistance facilitates migrant and refugees' successful long-term integration closer to home, discouraging them from undertaking dangerous irregular journeys to the United States. Separately, the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) bureau focuses on improving partner capacity to secure land, air, and sea borders; acquisition of new technologies; and facilitation of coordination with U.S. law enforcement. Questions From Honorable Delia Ramirez for Marta Youth Question 1a. The wait times to receive a CBP One appointment remain extremely long and only a few ports of entry accept appointments, which has forced people to wait for months in Mexico, often in dangerous conditions and without the ability to support themselves. What is the United States Government's role in and strategy for ensuring the safety and protection of people waiting for a CBP One appointment? Answer. Since 2021, the United States has led the largest expansion of lawful pathways to the United States in decades to provide refugees, vulnerable migrants, and displaced persons in the Western Hemisphere with safe and humane options. PRM supports programming in Mexico to meet humanitarian needs and increase access to protection for refugees, asylum seekers, and vulnerable migrants. Our international organization partners deliver life-saving water, shelter, sanitation, and emergency health care to the most vulnerable migrants. The Department defers to the Department of Homeland Security on details regarding questions related to CBP One. Question 1b. What insight does your agency have on the conditions that those who are waiting for an appointment encounter and endure while they stay in Mexico, particularly those who are not Mexican nationals? Answer. Humanitarian partners on the ground, including UNHCR, IOM, and UNICEF, frequently report protection concerns in Mexico for refugees, asylum seekers, internally-displaced persons, and vulnerable migrants. Specifically, the Department understands some migrants face extortion and violence at the hands of transnational criminal organizations in Mexico. For additional details regarding CBP One applicants, the Department defers to the Department of Homeland Security which administers and monitors the implementation of CPB One application. Question 1c. What coordination is occurring with the government of Mexico to meet the needs of those who are waiting for a CBP One appointment? Answer. In close coordination with the Mexican government, PRM's partners provide technical and material support to reinforce Mexico's shelter capacity and strengthen humane migration management mechanisms. PRM funds partners like UNHCR, IOM, and UNICEF to build the capacity of Mexican government officials, particularly in providing protection for the most vulnerable migrants. For additional details regarding CBP One applicants, the Department defers to the Department of Homeland Security which administers and monitors the implementation of CPB One. Question 2. How has your agency consulted with those who have used or could use CBP One to enter the United States, as well as with immigration advocates and services providers, to inform the development of CBP One and U.S. border enforcement efforts? How is your agency engaging with those directly impacted to optimize the app and inform migration policies going forward? Answer. The Department has engaged with colleagues from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to provide feedback on the CBP One application based on information gathered from users and other stakeholders in Mexico. For further questions, the Department respectfully defers to DHS which administers and monitors the implementation of CPB One application. A P P E N D I X I I ----------
