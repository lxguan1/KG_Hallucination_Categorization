AMERICAN CONFIDENCE IN ELECTIONS: PREVENTING NONCITIZEN VOTING AND OTHER FOREIGN INTERFERENCE ---------- May 16, 2024 Committee on House Administration, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:17 a.m., in room 1310, Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Bryan Steil  presiding. Present: Representatives Steil, Loudermilk, Murphy, Bice, Carey, Lee, Morelle, Sewell, Torres, and Kilmer. Staff present: March Bell, General Counsel and Parliamentarian; Jackie Bossman, Counsel; Annemarie Cake, Deputy Clerk and Professional Staff; Alexander Deise, Counsel; Kristen Monterroso, Director of Operations and Legislative Clerk; Michael Platt, Staff Director; Jordan Wilson, Director of Member Services; Khalil Abboud, Minority Deputy Staff Director; Jamie Fleet, Minority Staff Director; Nicole Hansen, Minority Elections Counsel; Sarah Nasta, Minority Senior Advisor and Director; Owen Reilly, Minority Professional Staff; and Sean Wright, Minority Chief Counsel. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BRYAN STEIL, CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION, A U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM WISCONSIN Chairman Steil. The Committee on House Administration will come to order. I note that a quorum is present. Without objection, the chair may declare a recess at any time. Also, without objection, the hearing record will remain open for 5 legislative days so Members may submit any material they wish to be included therein. Thank you, Ranking Member Morelle, Members of the Committee, and our witnesses for participating in today's hearing. The U.S. Constitution protects the rights of citizens of the United States to vote in our elections. In fact, Federal law makes it a felony for noncitizens to vote in Federal elections. Most but not all States outlawed noncitizen voting in their elections. American elections are for American citizens, and we intend to keep it that way. Recently, we have seen Democratic-run cities allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections. Washington, D.C., New York, Maryland, California, and others have passed legislation to allow noncitizens to vote in elections. This causes a host of problems for a State to maintain clean voter registration lists. Let me explain. The National Voter Registration Act was enacted to help increase the number of eligible American citizens that are registered to vote. By giving applicants voter registration forms when getting a driver's license, more individuals are likely to register. However, noncitizens here legally are entitled to Federal, State benefits, including driver's licenses. That means, in some circumstances, noncitizens also receive these same voter registration forms. My concern is that the interpretation of the NVRA makes it difficult for States to maintain clean voter lists. We should be giving States tools to ensure their voter rolls are clean as we approach November's election. Yet jurisdictions allowing noncitizens to vote, like Washington, D.C., are only required to keep one voter list. Maintaining one clean list, with U.S. citizens and noncitizen voters, presents challenges. Let us take a look at examples of these challenges where NVRA was misinterpreted in Pennsylvania and in Ohio. In 2022, the Public Interest Legal Foundation found Pennsylvania had allowed noncitizens to register to vote for decades. Pennsylvania later publicly admitted that, due to an alleged programming glitch, that the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation had allowed noncitizens to register to vote. Last week, Ohio's secretary of State, Frank LaRose, ordered the State's voter rolls to be cleaned after a review found more than a hundred noncitizens in Ohio were registered to vote. These examples raise serious concerns. In D.C., the Board of Elections says it is on the noncitizen to understand they cannot vote in Federal elections. Right now, in our Nation's Capital, roughly 500 noncitizens are already registered to vote. Let me be clear. Noncitizen voting reduces confidence in our elections. Washington, D.C., is setting a new standard that could soon be applied across the country. We must stop noncitizen voting. That is why our Committee passed my bill, the American Confidence in Elections Act. One section of the bill allows States to access Federal data bases that contain citizenship information so noncitizens can be removed from the voter rolls. As we continue to see foreign actors interested in influencing our elections, our current practices should cause us all concern. Since President Biden took office, over 7 million illegal immigrants have crossed the Southern Border. We must ensure our elections are secure and running properly without foreign influence. Yet, last month, Washington, D.C., mailed this--last month, Washington, D.C., mailed this postcard across the city, encouraging noncitizens to vote. In response, I sent a letter to the D.C. Board of Elections about the postcard. The D.C. Board is actively hosting virtual town halls encouraging noncitizens to vote. To vote in local elections in our Nation's Capital, you only need to reside here for 30 days. That means any noncitizen who moves to D.C. by October 5th can vote in this November's election. If any of the 7 million migrants moved to D.C. by this October, they can vote in the upcoming election. In our Nation's Capital, they do not even need a photo identification to do it. This does not instill confidence in our elections. The Committee on House Administration has broad oversight of our Nation's Federal elections, including here in our Nation's Capital. We have passed a bill to require citizenship to vote in D.C. elections. Republicans on this Committee are committed to ending noncitizen voting. We will also discuss the role foreign nationals play in our elections by contributing to nonprofits. Federal law prohibits foreign nationals from contributing to campaigns. However, we have seen foreign nationals use a loophole to get around this. Yesterday I introduced legislation to close that loophole. When our Committee heard from all six commissioners on the Federal Election Commission last year, Democrats and Republicans alike, every Commissioner agreed that this loophole should be closed, and I am hopeful that we can all agree that only American citizens should be contributing and voting in our elections. I would like to thank our witnesses for joining us today to discuss these important topics. With that, I yield to the Ranking Member for 5 minutes for his opening remarks.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOSEPH MORELLE, RANKING MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION, A U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM NEW YORK Mr. Morelle. Good morning. Thank you, Chairman Steil. Thank you to each of our witnesses for being here this morning. Donald Trump's unprecedented attempt to stop the peaceful transfer of power is an appalling stain on American history, but it appears the lessons Republicans learned from the fiasco that the former President caused in 2020 was not ``Don't steal an election''; it was ``Just start earlier.'' For all else being said here today, here's the one takeaway that you should remember, that we should be all very clear-eyed about: MAGA extremists are laying the ground work to overturn the 2024 election, to betray, once again, the will of the American people. Today's hearing is not actually about noncitizens illegally voting in Federal elections. Even the Conservative Cato Institute acknowledges this is not a problem. What does Speaker Johnson have to say on the subject? Just last week, he declared that he knows intuitively that a lot of noncitizens are voting in Federal elections, but it has not been something that is easily provable. Not provable, because there is no proof. The Washington Post has it right: Republicans have increasingly acknowledged that their claims are all about the vibes. Republicans are not governing based on facts. Frankly, they are not governing at all, and it's an embarrassment. This hearing is about preemptively covering Donald Trump's lies. The hearing is not about law and order. It is about laying the foundation for the next big lie. It is about saying that illegal voting is the cause of an election defeat. We know this is untrue because we know the law is already clear. I will read from 18 U.S.C. 611. Quote: ``It shall be unlawful for any alien to vote in any election held solely or in part for the purpose of electing a candidate for the office of President, Vice President, Presidential elector, Member of the Senate, Member of the House of Representatives,'' end quote, or other Federal offices. I will say it again: It is unlawful for noncitizens to vote in Federal elections. A violation of this law is punishable by up to a year in prison followed by deportation. Additionally, 52 U.S. Code 20511 makes, quote, ``The procurement or submission of voter registration applications that are known by the person to be materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent,'' end quote, a felony, which, by the way, would result from a 5-year prison term and subsequent deportation. These laws are already on the books, and these laws work. That is why Speaker Johnson had to publicly admit he has no proof of fraud. Republicans know they work. My majority colleagues know in their heart of hearts, that American elections are secure, fair, and free. They know this truth. Look at the parade of former Trump administration officials who, when put under oath, when facing penalty of perjury by Congress or other law enforcement officials, confirmed that their claims about fraud in the 2020 election were false, confirmed that President Trump lied to--and by the way, continues to lie every day to the American people. This is the public record. MAGA Republicans are howling about this nonissue, not because they believe American elections are insecure, but because they are desperate to destroy American confidence in elections. They want Americans to be afraid. They want Americans to believe Donald Trump's inevitable excuses, his torrent of lies about fraud when he, once again, leads the Republican Party down a path of insurrection. It is unconscionable that the same cast of characters that tried to steal an election 4 years ago are preparing to do it again and are using this Committee, using this hearing to begin that process. The coup starts here. This is where it begins. When the history of Donald Trump's attempt to steal the 2024 election is written, and I assure you--I assure you--history will look closely at each of us. The Speaker's trip to Mar-a-Lago last month will stand out. The Speaker's press conference on the Capitol steps last week will stand out. This hearing today will stand out. It is profoundly disappointing that my Republican colleagues are comfortable with that. I certainly am not. With that, I yield back.

CORD BYRD, FLORIDA SECRETARY OF STATE; HANS VON SPAKOVSKY, MANAGER, ELECTION LAW REFORM INITIATIVE, AND SENIOR LEGAL FELLOW, EDWIN MEESE III CENTER FOR LEGAL AND JUDICIAL STUDIES, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION; J. CHRISTIAN ADAMS, PRESIDENT AND GENERAL COUNSEL, PUBLIC INTEREST LEGAL FOUNDATION; CAITLIN SUTHERLAND, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, AMERICANS FOR PUBLIC TRUST; AND MICHAEL WALDMAN, PRESIDENT AND CEO, BRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE AT NYU LAW SCHOOL. STATEMENT OF HON. CORD BYRD Mr. Byrd. Good morning, Chairman Steil, Ranking Member Morelle, and Members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to be here today. To begin, the United States Constitution provides that State legislatures prescribe the time, place, and manner of holding Federal elections. Florida law states that, quote, ``A person may become a registered voter only if that person is a citizen of the United States.'' In 2020, Floridians amended the State Constitution to make clear that, quote, ``only a citizen of the United States shall be eligible to vote.'' Florida has approximately 13.5 million active registered voters, and that number changes every minute of every day. A person turns 18. A person passes away. Or a person becomes a U.S. citizen and registers to vote for the first time. According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, 94,100 Floridians became naturalized U.S. citizens in 2023. The Federal Government has plenary authority over who becomes a naturalized citizen. The challenge States face is that there is not a Federal, legal-status data base that is current and reliable. The National Voter Registration Act, NVRA, of 1993, commonly known as the motor voter law, introduced national procedures for voter registration. It mandates that any person who applies for a driver's license may, if eligible, submit a voter registration application for Federal elections. When potential voters fill out a voter registration form, they must swear or affirm that they are a U.S. citizen. In Florida, it is a third-degree felony to falsely claim U.S. citizenship when registering to vote. Remarkably, however, Federal courts have interpreted the NVRA to prohibit States from requiring proof of citizenship at the time a person registers. In effect, Federal law forces the States to use the honor system. This is unacceptable. Because States are prevented from verifying citizenship on the front end, they must do so on the back end. Clean voter rolls become even more for necessary for ensuring clean elections. Florida has robust voter roll maintenance procedures to identify registered voters who are not U.S. citizens. The names of potential noncitizens who attempt to obtain or renew a driver's license are reported to the Florida Department of State, which then conducts a manual, case-by-case investigation to determine whether the person has registered to vote and to confirm whether the person is, in fact, a U.S. citizen. Once the investigation is complete and if the Department determines that the person is registered but is not a citizen, the person cannot be removed from the voter roll without due process as provided by Florida law. Florida cannot verify the citizenship status of persons in the United States without the assistance and cooperation of the Federal Government. Indeed, the Federal Government is the only source of accurate, up-to-date information on the citizenship status of such persons. In 2012, after filing a law against the United States Department of Homeland Security, Florida became one of the first States to receive access to DHS' Systematic Alien Verification from Entitlement program, otherwise known as the SAVE data base, for purpose of voter registration. Florida relies on this data base to verify a person's citizenship status, but to be frank, the SAVE data base is woefully inadequate. It is neither time-nor cost-efficient and it requires an alien registration number, which States occasionally do not possess, to access the information. Perhaps most importantly, the data base often lacks the most current information, which requires further time-consuming investigation. Indeed, because of the lack of timely information, States are sometimes unable to verify a person's citizenship status. That too is unacceptable. The Federal Government has a legal obligation to provide up-to-date citizenship information to the States. I urge Congress to address these deficiencies, which unfortunately can leave a gap in the States' abilities to maintain clean voter rolls. At the very least, the Federal Government should provide immediate notification when a resident of the State is naturalized. DHS should also provide local election officials access to the SAVE data base. Despite conducting a fair, honest, and efficient election in 2020, Florida did not rest on its laurels. In three successive legislative sessions, the Florida legislature passed substantial election-integrity legislation. In 2022, for example, Governor Ron DeSantis signed a law, creating the Office of Election Crimes and Security. This office conducts preliminary investigations into allegations of elections law violations or other election irregularities. OECS has referred noncitizen-voting cases to law enforcement for further investigation. In 2004, the Baker-Carter report, prepared by former President James Carter and former Secretary of State James Baker, stated that, quote, ``Fraud in any degree and in any circumstance is subversive to the electoral process,'' and that, quote, ``the best way to maintain ballot integrity is to investigate all credible allegations of election fraud and otherwise prevent fraud before it can affect an election.'' Voter fraud includes voting by noncitizens in Federal elections. Every illegitimate vote of a noncitizen negates the legitimate vote of a citizen. In 2000, only 537 votes in Florida determined the outcome of the Presidential race. Floridians have changed our State's constitution. We have strengthened our laws. We have engaged in legislation, and we have an office dedicated to investigating election crimes. The only impediment to doing more is the Federal Government. That is why States need action from our congressional leaders so we can fulfill our constitutional duties under the law.  PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. CORD BYRD  Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back. Thank you very much. Our next witness, Hans von Spakovsky is recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF HANS VON SPAKOVSKY Mr. von Spakovsky. Protecting the ability of American citizens to participate in our democratic process is one of the most important duties of Congress. That requires that ensuring that aliens, both those here legally and illegally, are not unlawfully registering and voting, spending money to support or oppose candidates in State referenda, or distorting and diluting representation of citizens by being included in apportionment and redistricting. We know that aliens are registering and actually voting. Although we do not know the extent of the problem since the vast majority of States are not verifying citizenship. The indicators that it is occurring are there, and it is important to understand that every vote by an alien voids the vote of a citizen. To verify the accuracy of voter registration data, State election officials should be given complete and easy access to the SAVE system that Secretary Byrd mentioned but also to the E-Verify system. Federal courts obtain their lists of potential jurors from State election officials. When someone is not a U.S. citizen, they are excused from jury duty, yet the Federal courts are not forwarding that information back to secretaries of State so they can take appropriate action. Congress needs to amend the NVRA to clarify that the NVRA does not prohibit States from requiring applicants to provide proof they are U.S. citizens. Congress, also, because of its constitutional authority over aliens, could make that a requirement for Federal elections. The Federal Government requires individuals to provide such proof in order to be employed, and the right to work and earn a living is just as important as the right to vote. Barring States from requiring proof of citizenship makes no sense, particularly when the Federal Government requires that in order to be employed. The Federal application for naturalization form asks whether an alien has, quote, ``ever registered to vote or voted in any Federal, State, or local election in the United States.'' When an alien answers ``yes,'' DHS just sits on that information. Federal law needs to be changed to require DHS, when they get a ``yes'' answer, to forward that information to the State election official where that alien registered or voted, to the State attorney general, and to the U.S. Department of Justice so that State election officials can take that individual off the rolls and State and Federal prosecutors can investigate and prosecute. Federal campaign finance law prohibits Federal--governments and aliens from participating in elections for candidates for office, but the definition of ``elections'' in the Federal Election Campaign Act does not include ballot referenda, according to the U.S. Supreme Court. According to FEC, it also does include recall elections. That is a change that needs to be made in the law to keep foreign influence out of our elections. Reapportionment after the 2020 Census gave additional seats to some States and reduced the number of seats held by seven. Six States got more seats. Seven States had their representatives reduced. That reapportionment was based on the total population of the U.S., which includes all aliens whether they are here legally or illegally, even though they are not allowed to participate in our democratic political process. In addition to distorting representation in the House, it distorts our Presidential election because, of course, reapportionment determines how many electoral votes someone has. How bad is the distortion? A 2015 report by the congressional Research Service estimated that apportionment based on citizen population would give additional seats to seven States and reduce the numbers of seats in four States. Given the unprecedented influx of aliens into this country in the last number of years, that distortion is obviously much worse today. We should provide both access and security in the election process for all eligible U.S. citizens. Allowing aliens to participate in the election process unfairly dilutes the votes of all citizens regardless of their race or which political party they affiliate with. Congress and the States need to take steps to stop this from happening. Thank you.  PREPARED STATEMENT OF HANS VON SPAKOVSKY  Chairman Steil. Thank you. The gentleman yields back. Mr. Christian Adams is recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF J. CHRISTIAN ADAMS Mr. Adams. Thank you, Chairman Steil, Ranking Member Morelle, Members of the Committee. Thank you for the invitation to testify. In this polarized atmosphere, it would be wonderful if we could agree on a few basic facts. Noncitizens are, in fact, getting onto American voter rolls, and some of them are voting. The data show that most often noncitizens are getting on the rolls through the motor voter process or third-party registration drives. Ignoring this problem ignores the harmful impacts to both our elections but also to the aliens who are caught in the system breakdown. Because they have registered to vote, often at the behest of third parties or bureaucrats, these well-meaning green card holders face deportation. When a foreigner registers to vote in the motor voter system, as undeniably happened by the thousands in Pennsylvania, every American should be concerned. Once upon a time, fixing this problem would have been a bipartisan priority. We have identified four core elements that lead to foreigners registering and voting. No. 1, a faulty, motor voter system facilitates alien registration and then voting. We discovered this most dramatically in Pennsylvania in 2017 where every PennDOT customer was offered voter registration for an estimated two decades regardless of citizenship. Even worse, foreign-language customers were screened in different written languages than the ones they speak. That increase the number of foreign voter registrations. Element two, when States do not or are prevented from investigating prior claims of noncitizenship, foreign nationals fill the rolls. In previous years, States like Florida and Texas, have been disrupted by the courts from trying to study indications of foreign citizenship among existing registrants. Element three, when election officials do not carefully review forms, foreigners get registered. The Federal form that Congress approved 30 years ago requires an attestation of U.S. citizenship via a checkbox. After 30 years of motor voter, we can conclusively say the checkbox honor system has failed. Unfortunately, my organization has found, in California, Florida, Texas, Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and other States, where applicants actually admitted on the registration form they were not U.S. citizens and still got registered to vote. We call these checkbox noes. Litigation that the Public Interest Legal Foundation has brought has revealed disturbing numbers of the checkbox noes, registrations across the country where they tell the election official they are not a citizen, and they still get registered to vote. Election officials are dropping the ball. Finally, element four, a lack of transparency. Secrecy preserves bad practices and fosters conspiratorial concerns. When people do not know the truth, they think things up that are not true, and that is why States have to comply with section 8 of NVRA and disclose public records. In 2024, it is no longer an open question whether foreign nationals are registering and voting. Anyone who would try to argue otherwise has not read the data. We have documented the problems. We have documented the Middle Eastern immigrant whose green card was revoked in Pennsylvania after PennDOT offered him registration in an unfamiliar language. He lost 7 years of his life trying to clear his name until Pennsylvania admitted to a mass glitch in the motor voter system. We have documented the Sudanese refugee in Pittsburgh who was given an English voter registration form at a time when he needed an interpreter. We found records of a San Francisco college student whose coursework was disrupted because he mistook a Federal voter drive for a campus election. This is just a tiny sample of the stacks of documents that we have available of victims, aliens who are in the green card process, who have been sucked into the motor voter system, registered to vote, and jeopardized their legal status in the United States. People are registering through a broken motor voter system. They are victims to this broken system, and Congress can fix it through a few basic simple fixes. Thank you very much.  PREPARED STATEMENT OF J. CHRISTIAN ADAMS  Chairman Steil. Thank you very much. The gentleman yields back. Ms. Caitlin Sutherland is recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF CAITLIN SUTHERLAND Ms. Sutherland. Chairman Steil, Ranking Member Morelle, and Members of the Committee, thank you for the invitation and opportunity to testify before you today. My name is Caitlin Sutherland, and I am the executive director of Americans for Public Trust, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to restoring trust in government by holding politicians and political groups accountable. Since our founding in 2020, APT has devoted extensive resources to uncovering, mapping, and publicizing outside money and influence in politics and policy. Americans should have every confidence that their elections are free from foreign interference and influence, but unfortunately a significant source of foreign cash is flowing into politics from a Swiss billionaire named Hansjorg Wyss. Multiple press outlets have confirmed Mr. Wyss is a foreign national, but do not just take their word for it. Listen to what Mr. Wyss has said about the matter. In 2011, Mr. Wyss told a Swiss newspaper that he, quote, ``never felt the need to become an American,'' end quote. He claimed he found the process too, quote, ``complicated,'' end quote, and instead preferred to call himself, quote, ``a spiritual dual citizen,'' end quote. Despite Mr. Wyss' disinterest in becoming an American citizen, he made it a personal goal to influence American politics. According to a biography written by his own sister, Mr. Wyss' goal is to, quote, ``reinterpret the American Constitution in the light of progressive politics,'' end quote. How is Mr. Wyss, who is not a U.S. citizen and therefore prohibited from directly and indirectly influencing our elections, doing just that? Well, first, in the 1990's and early aughts, he, seemingly illegally, gave more than $100,000 directly to candidates and committees. Mr. Wyss' direct giving pales in comparison to his current and preferred method of influencing our politics: his nonprofits. Mr. Wyss uses his two nonprofits, the Wyss Foundation, a 501(c)(3), and the Berger Action Fund, formerly called the Wyss Action Fund, a 501(c)(4), to fund liberal groups across the Nation. He has used these two nonprofits to pump almost half a billion dollars in the U.S. political system. In his biography, Mr. Wyss' sister explicitly detailed his ability to, quote, ``exert an influence on American domestic politics through his foundations,'' end quote. If this sounds like a staggering amount of money from a reclusive foreign billionaire and organizations that are far from being household names, that is because it is all by design. Again, while speaking to foreign media, Mr. Wyss admitted that he was fighting laws in Arizona that, quote, ``give police too many rights,'' end quote, working to nominate progressive Federal judges, and funding abortion clinics. The catch, he also bragged that his, quote, ``name never appears,'' end quote, linked to his efforts. In fact, the Associated Press described Berger Action Fund as, quote, ``a nondescript name for a group with a rather specific purpose: steering the wealth of Hansjorg Wyss, a Swiss billionaire, into the world of American politics and policy.'' How exactly in his own words does he exert an influence? According to The New York Times, Mr. Wyss', quote, ``political activism is channeled through a daisy chain of opaque organizations that mask the ultimate recipients of his money.'' The most opaque of those organizations is a little known group called the Sixteen Thirty Fund, which, according to Bloomberg, serves as, quote, ``a clearinghouse for the left,'' end quote, and has also received $243 million from Mr. Wyss. Sixteen Thirty Fund bankrolls efforts to elevate President Biden's agenda, fund Supreme Court nomination fights, invest in massive, voter-turnout operations, engages in issue-advocacy campaigns against vulnerable Republican Senators and Representatives, and has funneled nearly $100 million and counting into State ballot issues across 25 States. That is right: The same group that has received around a quarter of a billion dollars from a foreign national turns around and spends it on Geo TV, voter registration, super PACs, and ballot issues. These foreign influence loopholes must be closed. Foreign nationals are already barred from donating to candidates directly. Why should all these vehicles that influence our elections be any different? American elections should be for American citizens. Stopping foreign nationals, whether they be a reclusive Swiss billionaire or a Communist dictator, from funding U.S. policy fights is a simple step to take. In his 1796 farewell address, George Washington cautioned that, quote, ``Foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government,'' end quote. Over 200 years later, that sentiment remains true. Thank you.  PREPARED STATEMENT OF CAITLIN SUTHERLAND  Chairman Steil. Thank you. The gentlewoman yields back. Mr. Michael Walden is recognized for 5 minutes for an opening statement. STATEMENT OF MICHAEL WALDMAN Mr. Waldman. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Morelle, Members of the Committee, Americans are concerned about the health of our democracy and rightly so. Ever since our Nation was founded in the Declaration of Independence on the idea that government is legitimate only when it rests on the consent of the governed, we have struggled, over decades and centuries, to live up to that ideal, to make sure that our ability to have self-government extends to all eligible Americans. All of us, whatever our views, should care and fight for elections that are free and fair and secure. In the sweep of American history, the rise of the election- denier movement is extremely disturbing. Never before has there been an organized political force determined and devoted to undermining public trust in our system and in our elections in this manner. Now, in 2020, we heard wild stories of voting machines flipping votes, of boxes of ballots, of ballot paper that supposedly had bamboo fibers in it to prove it came from China. This year, we are hearing the beginning of wild stories about widespread, huge numbers of noncitizens voting in Federal elections. Let us be clear: This is an urban myth. It is a conspiracy theory. It is not true. Why is it happening now? It is being pushed preemptively, I believe, to set the stage for undermining the legitimacy of the 2024 election. This year, the big lie is being predeployed. It is the basis for the SAVE Act and what we believe is an unnecessary and misguided piece of legislation. As we have heard, it is illegal today for noncitizens to vote in Federal elections--very illegal. States have a multiplicity of procedures in place to detect and prevent it. As a result, noncitizen voting in Federal elections is vanishingly rare. Now, this legislation would essentially require citizens, eligible voters, to produce a birth certificate or a passport, or a naturalization papers in some instances, to vote. These are documents that many millions of Americans do not have-- eligible voters, citizens do not have. Now, Speaker Mike Johnson, as we have heard, said recently on the Capitol steps that we all know that intuitively this all must be happening, as he said, quote, ``but it has not been something that is easily provable.'' In fact, it is easily disprovable. Any individual who illegally registers or votes in a Federal election leaves a paper trail. They are handing the evidence of their crime over to the government. There is--these records are publicly available to all for scrutiny, and as I said, governments have ample opportunity to find, detect, and prevent this kind of action. There are real problems in our electoral system--challenges to our elections, disinformation and deepfakes driven by AI, racially motivated voter suppression, a broken campaign finance system, gerrymandering by both political parties. Congress should act to address these and other real challenges. We urge the Congress to enact the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Together they would modernize our elections, set national standards, address gerrymandering and dark money and funds from outside the country, and restore the full strength of the Nation's most effective civil rights law. At the very least, we urge Congress to act, on a bipartisan basis, as it has before, to provide funds for election officials to do the very work of securing election integrity and securing accurate lists, voter rolls, and running these elections in upcoming appropriations, as has been in the case in previous years. We can do this. We can bolster election integrity while ensuring free and fair elections. We can do this if we rely on facts--not fear--facts, not, quote, intuition. Congress has done this before. It should do it again, and we urge you to reject measures that would undermine faith in our system and disenfranchise many eligible voters, and instead come together for reforms that would improve our system and continue our march toward that system envisioned by the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. Thank you.  PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHAEL WALDMAN  Chairman Steil. Thank you. The gentleman yields back. I will begin our questions today, followed by the Ranking Member. We will then alternate between parties. I recognize myself for 5 minutes for the purpose of asking our witnesses questions. Mr. Christian Adams, I want to start with you. Federal law makes it a felony for noncitizens to vote in Federal elections. Is that correct? Mr. Adams. It is. Chairman Steil. Federal law also makes it a felony to submit a voter form with false info, like citizenship, correct? Mr. Adams. Correct. Chairman Steil. Under the NVRA, National Voter Registration Act, States are required to provide voter-registration materials at various State offices, including those providing public assistance, right? Mr. Adams. Yes, it has one, but it is limited, the burden on the States, but---- Chairman Steil. OK. How does the NVRA deal with the situation when noncitizens receive public benefits like driver's licenses? Do they get voter-registration materials? Mr. Adams. Well, some States have started to cram in voter- registration materials with those public-benefit applications which are going to citizens and noncitizens alike. Chairman Steil. OK. With that background then, the situation in Pennsylvania, what did your organization learn about the voter rolls when you brought the lawsuit in Pennsylvania? Mr. Adams. Yes, this is a disaster what happened in Pennsylvania that has not gotten enough attention. Steve Dinan of The Washington Times has written about it. Pennsylvania was registering noncitizens for 20 years, and they admit it. This is not subject to debate. The question is, was it 10,000 or 100,000? Chairman Steil. That needs to be fixed immediately in Pennsylvania, correct? Mr. Adams. Well, we are suing to see what they did to fix it, and we are in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. We have already won summary judgment to get the records of the fix, but Pennsylvania's playing keep away. Chairman Steil. Thank you for that. Let me shift to you, Mr. Hans von Spakovsky if I can. Ohio recently announced that they did a review and found a hundred noncitizens on their voter rolls. Is that accurate? Mr. von Spakovsky. Yes. Chairman Steil. Then, sticking with the topic of noncitizen voting, is not it true that, this November, noncitizens that reside in D.C. for simply 30 days can vote in D.C. municipal elections? Mr. von Spakovsky. That is correct. Chairman Steil. D.C. also mails every registered voter a ballot, correct? Mr. Adams. Correct. Chairman Steil. You are telling me that, in Washington, D.C., if there is even a small clerical mistake, noncitizens could be mailed a ballot with Federal races on them? Mr. von Spakovsky. That is correct. Chairman Steil. We have heard and we know it is a felony for noncitizens to vote in Federal races, but the D.C. Board of Elections held a call a few weeks ago, encouraging noncitizens to vote in municipal elections and told the public it was on the noncitizen to understand they cannot vote in the Federal election, correct? Mr. von Spakovsky. That is correct. Chairman Steil. Then I want to go back, because we heard from one of our other witnesses that noncitizen voting is a myth, that there is no evidence of this. Was there a case where there was a close election in the House of Representatives, and Congress went back and studied whether or not noncitizens actually pertook in that election or not? Mr. von Spakovsky. There was, and, in fact, I brought the report. This is the House Oversight Committee report from 1998, and it was the investigation of the race between--between Bob Dornan and Loretta Sanchez. Margin of victory, 979 votes. Because the INS refused to give the Committee records, they had to subpoena them, and when they compared the INS records to the Orange County Register, they found clear and convincing evidence that 624 aliens had registered and voted. They found circumstantial evidence of 196 aliens who had registered and voted. That is 820---- Chairman Steil. What did they have to do to be able to cross-check that? Mr. von Spakovsky. They had to check--take the INS records and check it against the voter registration records. Chairman Steil. Is this done in every election? Mr. von Spakovsky. No, it is not done--it is not done at all. Chairman Steil. Well, we were told there was a paper trail. We were told by another witness that there was a paper trail. You are telling me that this paper trail only came because Congress subpoenaed the records in this case? Mr. von Spakovsky. That is exactly right, and that is why, as Secretary Byrd said, secretary of State need to be given access to DHS records. Chairman Steil. Secretary Byrd, if you were concerned--you run solid elections in the State of Florida--but if you were concerned that this was taking place, would you have the access that Congress had in the review of the 1998 election? Mr. Byrd. We do not have that access in a timely and efficient manner. Chairman Steil. Would you like the access to that? Mr. Byrd. Absolutely. Chairman Steil. It would make total sense to be able--we were told that there is a paper trail--to allow you to go and to review whether or not this is taking place, because as Hans von Spakovsky just said, that, in the case where it was reviewed, over 600 individuals were found to be noncitizens who voted in that election. Is that correct? I will come back to you, Hans von Spakovsky, on that. Mr. von Spakovsky. It is, and it is against the law. I am not aware that the U.S. Department of Justice investigated or prosecuted a single one of those aliens who voted. I have personal experience with this also. I was on the Fairfax County Board of Elections, and in 2011, I asked the General Registrar, ``Do you all check the DMV records to see whether individuals who show up to get a driver's license''-- you know, here legally but they are aliens--``do you check to see whether they've registered to vote.'' He said, ``Well, no, we do not do that.'' I said, ``You need to do that.'' They checked; they found 278 individuals--this is just one county in Virginia--who were aliens. They investigated; they confirmed they were aliens. 117 of them had voted in prior elections. We took the 278 off the rolls, forwarded it to both the local Commonwealth attorney because it is against the law in Virginia. He did nothing about it. Chairman Steil. The way that you are describing this sounds a lot like, to me, that somebody's saying that there is nobody speeding on the interState. I would say, ``Well, how do you know then?'' They'd say, ``Well, it is very clear; the speed limit is 70 miles per hour, so we know no one is going over 70 miles an hour, and the evidence of that is there are no speeding tickets that have ever been issued,'' where if you actually went and reviewed this, as was done in this case, what we found was this is an actual and substantive problem, exacerbated by the fact that places like Washington, D.C., are allowing noncitizens to vote in municipal elections, do not have proper controls to prevent them from voting in Federal elections. Then, as we look--a staffer on my Committee walked by this ballot box in Washington, D.C., unlocked, unsecured. Does this increase confidence in elections in your opinion, Mr. von Spakovsky? Mr. von Spakovsky. No. It implements a huge risk that something could happen to those ballots. It could be stuffed with ballots. Ballots could be stolen. I mean---- Chairman Steil. If Washington, D.C., Board of Elections, if this is how they are operating their ballot box collection less than 1 mile from where we sit right here, it gives me great pause that there are not any clerical errors occurring as to when they have noncitizens on the voting rolls in Washington, D.C., being in a position to vote for Federal elections. That should cause grave concern, which is why noncitizens should not be voting in our elections, period, and it shows, from the evidence here, is exactly why we should actually be reviewing and enforcing the law as it relates to noncitizens voting in our Federal elections. Let me shift gears before I am done, quickly, to you, Ms. Sutherland, on a slightly different topic about foreign funds in U.S. elections. Today, under current law, can foreign nationals pay for activities like voter registration, ballot-harvesting, and get- out-the-vote activities. Ms. Sutherland. Yes. Chairman Steil. That is really concerning. We already saw the massive problems associated with Zuckerbucks in the 2020 election. We have held hearings on it here and flushed out those concerns. Congress needs to close that loophole. Now, does not Federal law generally prohibit foreign nationals from directly or indirectly spending money in U.S. elections? Ms. Sutherland. That is correct. Chairman Steil. As your organization has documented, foreign nationals are using nonprofits as a pass-through to give to, often Democratic, super PACs. Is that correct? Ms. Sutherland. That is correct. Chairman Steil. Can you explain that problem briefly? Ms. Sutherland. Absolutely. foreign nationals are prohibited from contributing to super PACs directly, but there is nothing prohibiting a foreign national from contributing to a 501(c)(4) that then turns around and gives to a super PAC. In fact, in 2020, we saw that the Sixteen Thirty Fund, that received tens of millions of dollars from a foreign national, turned around and contributed $60 million to a pro-Biden super PAC. Chairman Steil. Exactly the problem. When we had the FEC Commissioners in here, Democrats and Republicans alike, all agreed that we should close that loophole. I have introduced legislation to do just that, Preventing Foreign Interference in American Elections Act. I would love to see a full vote in favor by all 12 Members of this Committee. I think it is essential, as we are looking at foreign interference in our elections, that we come together to close that loophole that you just identified, that every FEC Commissioner that testified before us said should also be closed. This should be a no-brainer, and I hope to have that done before this November's election. I thank all of you for being here today. I yield back, and I will now recognize the Ranking Member for 5 minutes for questions. Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I think this Committee has already acted on that bill, I thought unanimously. I could be mistaken, but I would be happy to work with you on it. I think that is an important thing that we should work on. I do ask for unanimous consent to enter into the record an article published this morning by Reuters entitled ``Trump Allies Laying the Ground Work to Contest Potential Election Loss,'' which reports that Trump and his allies are laying-- planting seeds of doubt about the election, including the introduction of this bill. I will ask for unanimous consent---- Chairman Steil. Without objection. Without objection.   Mr. Morelle . to include that in the record. I said in my opening statement, and I will make clear again, everyone watching should be clear. This hearing is not a serious effort to stop noncitizens from voting, which does not happen and is already illegal, as I think everyone has testified. We know it again because of what the Speaker said. He admitted they have no evidence. Even what is being talked about here, he did not suggest that as evidence during his press conference. He said we actually intuitively know it. I think--I think others would agree--there is an effort to help the former President capture the Presidency. We should be clear about what a Trump Presidency would bring to this country. To do so, we need to look no further than Project 2025, which is an extremist 920-page manifesto, embraced by the Trump campaign, to reshape the Federal Government into an arch-Conservative Christian nationalist autocracy. Project 2025, organized by The Heritage Foundation, calls on a second Trump administration to massively expand the power of the Presidency and the power of the government over Americans' daily lives, and it outlines how a future Trump Department of Justice will prevent women nationwide from accessing healthcare, including access to abortion. In fact, Donald Ayer, a Republican Deputy Attorney General of the United States under George H.W. Bush, said that Project 2025 is full of, quote, ``ideas that are designed to let Donald Trump function as a dictator. He really wants to destroy any notion of the rule of law in this country and is now preparing to do a bunch of things totally contrary to the basic values we have always lived by. If Trump were to be elected and implement some of the ideas he is apparently considering, no one in this country would be safe.'' That is a Republican former Deputy Attorney General of the United States. How does this all tie in to today's hearing? Well, the majority has called one of the leading architects of Project 2025 to testify on behalf of their bill. I really have to give you credit for saying the quiet part out loud. My majority colleagues are not even trying to hide what they intend to do. They invited the architects of a day one dictator plan to this hearing, and I think it shows how extreme and undemocratic the entire exercise is, and the American public deserve a full transparency about what the Trump campaign is planning, what the majority witness and his organization is planning. I would like to, with unanimous consent, introduce for the record ``Mandate for Leadership, the Conservative Promise, Project 2025,'' into the record. Chairman Steil. Without objection.   Mr. Morelle. Mr. Waldman, let me ask you, are you familiar with Project 2025? Mr. Waldman. I am. Mr. Morelle. If this hearing is meant to help Donald Trump contest the outcome of the 2024 election--and it most certainly is--then plans like this Project 2025 and Conservative activists, like those called by the majority, are preparing to assist Donald Trump's administration implement catastrophic policies that Americans fundamentally oppose. By your estimation, how would Project 2025 damage American democracy and the rule of law? Mr. Waldman. Well, Project 2025 lays out, in audacious detail, a blueprint for an expansion of Presidential power unlike any we have seen in our history. It is not just a policy agenda for Conservative policies on taxes or the environment. It would fundamentally reshape checks and balances in the constitutional system. It would give a blueprint for the President taking control of the Justice Department and the FBI, for the President taking control of independent agencies. It would encouple with other agendas, such as schedule F, which would involve the purging of the Federal workforce of many civil servants to be replaced by political loyalists or the use of the Insurrection Act as a basis either for crackdown on opposition or as a basis for very aggressive seizing of noncitizens, and as articulated by former President Trump, a whole host of things, all taken together, would change the nature of American Government to something very different from what the Founders intended or what any of us would be comfortable with. Mr. Morelle. You know, the unsubstantiated fearmongering about insecure elections, voter fraud, that we heard in the days, weeks, and months leading up to the January 6th deadly attacks on the Capitol, you know, we have heard this before, and I wonder--again, Mr. Waldman, if you want to comment--do you see any parallels between this effort now to suggest that there is rampant fraud in Federal elections as a pretext for 2024? Mr. Waldman. It is not a mistake that it is happening now. It is, as I said, the big lie is being predeployed. In 2020, the election deniers were improvisational and somewhat slapdash. Now it is very well organized, and it is very well funded, and it is thought out well in advance to try to set the stage for challenging the legitimacy of elections. As we know, Donald Trump in 2016 said that he had really won the popular vote if you could deduct the millions of noncitizens who voted, he said. These were, evidently, invisible people because nobody ever saw them, and there was never any proof. That was an election he won. He did the same thing with other charges in 2020, and it is important to note too, that this myth of widespread, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, of noncitizen voters, was deployed in 2020 as well. Rudy Giuliani lost his law license in part because of his lies about noncitizen voting in Arizona-- lies, I should note, that were repeated by President Trump on the Ellipse as he sent the crowd up to the Capitol. This was not the central argument then, but it is now. Mr. Morelle. Very good. Thank you. I thank you for giving me the extra time, Mr. Chair. I yield back. Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back. Mrs. Bice is recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. Bice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I want to address a comment that was made prior, in opening statements, to Mr. Waldman. You mentioned that you felt like there were not massive numbers of illegals voting, and this should not be a focus. I think with more than 7 million illegals crossing into the United States in the last 3 or plus years, it is our duty that we ensure that we are protecting the integrity of the election system. That is why we are here today, is to ensure that that does not happen. Yes, we have identified--Mr. Adams has identified--areas where this is occurring, but to suggest that we should not be focused on this because it is not happening now, I think, is misguided. Mr. von Spakovsky, in jurisdictions that allow noncitizens, like Washington, D.C., to vote, will noncitizens be on the same voter-registration lists as citizens? Mr. von Spakovsky. As far as I know, they will be. If I could just quickly mention, the only requirement is to be a resident for 30 days. That means the Ambassador from Russia, a tyrannical regime trying to obliterate Ukraine, could easily register and vote in that election. Mrs. Bice. Should Federal law require these jurisdictions to have two separate lists and two separate ballots to ensure that this type of situation does not happen? Mr. von Spakovsky. Yes, they should. Otherwise, aliens may be voting, even when they should not be, in Federal elections. Mrs. Bice. Can you talk a little bit about the proposal that you have been championing which requires Federal district courts to transmit the names of dismissed noncitizen jurors to the State's chief election officials? Mr. von Spakovsky. Sure. In 2005, I think it is, GAO actually did a study on this. They were looking at information that might help--be helpful to State election officials. They surveyed a number of Federal district courts, and one Federal district court said, well, I think it was a 2-year period, about 3 percent of the individuals been called for jury duty had been excused because they were not U.S. citizens. Remember, you have to swear under oath, when you are answering questions like that. Obviously, that information should have been sent back to State election officials because those district courts also all confirmed, where were they getting their list of potential voters in places like Atlanta and Arizona? From the State election officials. Clearly, these were all individual aliens who were registered to vote, excused from Federal jury duty, yet the information was not getting back to election officials. Mrs. Bice. I want to pivot back just briefly with Ms. Sutherland's discussion on foreign interference in our elections through these (c)(4) organizations, and I want to enter into the record--I ask unanimous consent to enter a report from the People United for Privacy on the impacts of foreign donor reporting schemes. Chairman Steil. Without objection.   Mrs. Bice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Adams, I want to move over to you. The National Voter Registration Act exempted two States from requirements for registration. Can you tell us a little bit about that process? Mr. Adams. Sure. I have had the pleasure, I guess, of reading the congressional Record from 1993, and one of the issues was an exemption. There were seven States at the time-- Maine has since been unexempted--but the seven States--New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Idaho, Wyoming, and North Dakota--were exempted from the NVRA originally because they have same-day registration. They had same-day registration. North Dakota does not even have voter registration. They were exempted. We actually brought a lawsuit in Minnesota and Wisconsin in the last week to question that as an unequal sovereignty issue, that we are trying to get public records, because you cannot get public records in Wisconsin, especially from WEC and--not easily at least. We are trying to get public records in Wisconsin and challenging that exemption. Mrs. Bice. If Congress were to amend the Voter Registration Act, as some are thinking about doing, how would it work in these States that are exempt? Mr. Adams. Right. I think Congress should strongly consider ending the exemption because these States are already doing the motor voter registration generally, right. They are complying with what the Democrats wanted in 1993, but they are not complying with the Dole compromise of 1993, which was to make them subject to public inspection and to have clean voter rolls. Those six States are exempted from the clean voter roll obligation that I think Congress should seriously take a look at. Mrs. Bice. I think the big issue that I have is, as we are looking at this holistically, is that the voter rolls are not being cleaned up, which is causing some of the issues that we are seeing, and certainly, we need to be addressing that. With that, Mr. Chairman, my time is about up. I yield back. Chairman Steil. The gentlewoman yields back. Ms. Sewell is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. Sewell. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to thank all of our witnesses for being here. As the author of the John Robert Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and as the Ranking Member of the Election Subcommittee, there is nothing more important to me than making sure that every eligible American has a right to vote and equal access to the ballot box. Having said that, it is quite disturbing to me to listen to some of the allegations that are going on but, more importantly, the concerted, intentional effort, as you said, Mr. Waldman, to actually well-fund efforts to subvert the will of the people for the 2024 election. I know that in Alabama, where I am from, there is this belief that there is widespread fraud, and I know that the Brennan Center has done multiple studies about the fact that that is rare. You, in fact, said that the incidence of non-Americans voting--I do not like to say illegal aliens--just non-Americans voting is miniscule and rare, yet other witnesses have suggested that it happens in Virginia, and it happens in Florida. I wanted to know what your rebuttal is to that. Mr. Waldman. Over the decades, there have been billions of votes cast by Americans, and, overwhelmingly, our system is secure. As the Department of Homeland Security, Donald Trump's own Department of Homeland Security, said in 2020, it was the most secure election in American history. There is a multiplicity of systems in place that have been developed over the years to ensure that noncitizens are not voting in Federal elections, to ensure that only eligible citizens are. Unfortunately, we continue to see, over and over again, proposals that would make it harder for eligible citizens to vote. I will note that---- Ms. Sewell. Especially after the Shelby v. Holder decision where we saw a flood of States making it harder for people to vote, Americans to vote. Mr. Waldman. We have now new evidence compiled by political scientists at the Brennan Center from a dataset of a billion voter records, nearly a billion voter records, that the States that used to be covered by the strong Voting Rights Act---- Ms. Sewell. Like Alabama. Mr. Waldman. Alabama and other States before Shelby County in 2013 have seen a much wider growth in the gap between voter participation rates by White voters and non-White voters, which suggests the impact of that decision. Ms. Sewell. Let us talk about the SAVE Act that is currently being discussed. I personally think that it is trying to delegitimize votes by those who are of color, whether that is Black, Latino, Asian, Native American, let alone to allow them to cast a vote. Can you talk a little bit about the SAVE Act and why you think that this is so destructive? Mr. Waldman. Well, you are exactly right. We all should be making sure that our voter rolls are secure and accurate and that only eligible people can vote. Ms. Sewell. To be clear, all of us want to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat. Don't we all? Mr. Waldman. We all do, among many other things. The ERIC system, where States compared voter rolls, was the most effective way to assure accurate rolls, and other conspiracy theories and other scare stories prompted States to pull out of that, actually setting back the cause of election security. When you look at the proposal for documentary proof of citizenship, which sounds like a kind of an anodyne idea, again, what that means in practice is a certified birth certificate or a passport or maybe naturalization papers, and many millions of Americans just do not have that. We did a study in 2006 and, at that point, found it was 13 million Americans. When you think about not only that people do not have these--most Americans--or at least about half Americans do not have a passport. They are not summering to the south of France. Ms. Sewell. You know, my State, along with a lot of other States, imposed photo ID laws, and they prescribed in their State laws which photos are acceptable and which are not. I found it to be appalling that my State refused to take a student's license but would accept a gun permit license, and yet we are choosing winners and losers. At the end of the day, I have had lots of my constituents talk to me about--especially the elderly or the disabled who do not drive anymore, who do not have valid IDs, according to these papers, but yet they have a validly Federal ID, which is called a Social Security card that everybody has that is an American, and I think that it is really appalling that we are spending our time talking about this effort when the reality is we need to fully fund Federal elections. I think you touched upon that. We have the Federal Elections Commission, but we also have the Election Assistance Commission, and they are not funded. Actually, we zero out their budget. Can you talk a little bit about that in the time remaining? Mr. Waldman. Yes. Over the years, Congress, on a bipartisan basis, has provided support, robust support for State election administration, which is so vital to our country. It has not done so recently, and we think that the next appropriations bill---- Ms. Sewell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, sir. I wanted to also just ask for unanimous consent to add four things to the record: an article in The Hill by Ranking Member Morelle published today entitled ``Republicans Are Already Trying to Undermine the 2024 Election''; a letter from the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the Declaration for American Democracy Coalition opposing the SAVE Act; as well as an article from The Washington Post entitled ``Mike Johnson's Telling Comment on GOP's Lack of Voter Fraud Evidence''; and, last, an article from the Votebeat entitled ``Documents Show Republican-Led States Struggling to Clean Voter Rolls After Leaving ERIC.'' Can I please submit them? Chairman Steil. Without objection.   Mr. Loudermilk is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Loudermilk. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Election integrity ranks in the top three issues that are most important to Americans across the board. I mean, this is Republicans, Democrats, and independents. This is not a partisan issue. This is an election integrity issue. When we allow someone who is not legally authorized to vote in this country to make decisions that are incredibly important to the safety, the security, and the economic viability of Americans, we undermine and undercut the value of each and every individual vote, whether Republican, Democrat, Independent, or whatever. This is extremely important to both sides. This is not a political issue, or it should not be. This should be an issue that I would venture to say, 10 years ago, 20 years ago, we would not be having this debate on a partisan basis. We would be looking for solutions to make sure every American, regardless of race, creed, religion, whatever, that their vote counts and is not discredited by someone who should not be voting. We have a couple of bills that are trying to address these, and Mr. von Spakovsky, I want to ask you about your thoughts regarding Representative Roy's recently introduced SAVE Act. I know he is trying to address this. We have the ASAC that we have worked on for a long time in this Committee. Regarding the SAVE Act, do you think it gives States the right tools to prevent noncitizens from registering to vote? Mr. von Spakovsky. Yes, of course, they do. The impediments that have been put in their way to prevent them from doing that need to be eliminated. By the way, can I just say very quickly, all of these claims that, for example, States requiring proof of citizenship is somehow going to suppress and keep people from voting, that is exactly the same kind of mythical claims that have been made against voter ID for more than a decade. Yet the turnout numbers show, particularly in your State of Georgia, first time in Presidential election ID 2008, the turnout numbers show it did not suppress votes. You had record registration, record voting of all voters, including minority voters in your State. Mr. Loudermilk. If I may add on to that, the voter ID requirement, my understanding, and you may confirm this, is that is a bipartisan issue. It ranks very highly among Democrat voters as well. Am I correct? Mr. von Spakovsky. The polling universally, it does not matter whether you go to a Rasmussen poll or Washington Post poll, the polling shows that Americans simply do not believe this idea that somehow it is going to keep people from voting. Overwhelmingly, voters say that is a commonsense requirement, and it does not matter which political party they are a member of or what their race or ethnicity is. Mr. Loudermilk. Voter rolls I think are the key to most of this, and we still, I hear quite often people telling me they have moved out of State. I hear from people that have moved from Georgia, from another State, and they are still getting ballots from their previous State. Does the SAVE Act go far enough with their mandatory list provisions, maintenance provisions? Mr. von Spakovsky. Oh, I think it is a good start on helping to fix that problem. There are more things that States could be doing. As Secretary Byrd can tell you, Florida, for example, is now entering into agreements with other States to compare and share their voter registration data to, in fact, find people who are registered in more than one State, which that is a problem, and more States need to be encouraged to do that. Mr. Loudermilk. You touched on this a few minutes ago, and it is regarding data bases. Are there additional data bases that States should have access to, to get the information they need to remove non-citizens from their rolls? I mean, you have already talked about jury duty, but what data bases should they be able to access? Mr. von Spakovsky. Well, we have mentioned the SAVE system. We have also mentioned E-Verify. Those who think that is enough, it is not, and the reason for that is, look, DHS is going to have in its records aliens who are here legally, aliens who are here illegally who have been detained. Aliens who have gotten into the country, have never been detained, never been processed, are not going to be in it. In fact, again, if you look at this report from 1998, the Committee says, ``Look, we found 820 aliens who were in the INS records who were registered to vote, but this only''-- documented aliens. They said that leaves open the question, well, how many aliens were registered who had never been processed or caught by the INS? Mr. Loudermilk. Well, thank you. I appreciate that. Let me just close with this--my time is up--that what we are trying to do here is to ensure that an election not only cannot be stolen but the accusation of that will never happen again. I yield back. Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back. Kilmer is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Kilmer. Thanks, Chairman. My first question is for Mr. Waldman. I appreciate the concerns you raise in your testimony about the capacity of foreign adversaries to interfere in American elections. You know, one of the things that I have been looking at quite a bit is the fact that, right now, if any of us run ads on TV or ads on the radio, there are certain disclosure requirements. You get to know who paid for that ad. There is, you know, in essence, the public file where people can see the information about that ad. That is not true for internet-based advertisement. You know, why is that a problem? Well, one, we know that more and more political spending is migrating into that arena. Two, we know from declassified reports by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that Russia, China, Iran, and others have sought to influence public perception of candidates through the internet. We have a bipartisan, bicameral bill called the Honest Ads Act to try to close that gap, and it simply would provide the same accountability and transparency standards that exist for TV and radio and apply them to the internet. What do you think? Mr. Waldman. Thank you for your leadership in the introduction of the Honest Ads Act. We think it is very important. This year, we think that up to 30 percent of spending on political ads will be online, and the protections that were in place in an era of broadcast TV and antennas on the top of your set are not enough for the digital era and especially the era that we are moving into with all the risks of disinformation and deepfakes and everything else. We think that the Honest Ads Act, which is bicameral and bipartisan, should be an urgent priority. I should note that important elements of it are also in the Freedom to Vote Act as part of that significant upgrade of the American electoral system. Mr. Kilmer. Thanks. I just commend to any of my colleagues here, I am happy to share information with you about that bill because I think to me it is a commonsense how do we keep foreign actors from trying to mess with our elections. I want to stick with you. You know, I share some of the concerns you have raised about the impacts of the SAVE Act on eligible voters in the U.S. You know, when I think about some of these issues regarding voter engagement and access to the ballot box, I think about my grandma. We called her Oma. She was a remarkable woman. She survived two World Wars. She was liberated by allied soldiers and came to this country from the Netherlands in 1948. She built a life here. She became an American citizen at the age of 87 because she wanted to vote. She lived until just south of 109 years old. She was an incredibly proud voter. As a person who was born 10 years before women's suffrage in this country, she was an incredibly proud voter. I think about some of these bits of legislation sort of through her perspective, right. She became a citizen at 87. At her age, she did not have a passport because, from her perspective, she was too old to travel anywhere. She did not have a driver's license. She had never driven. You can buy a photo ID in the State of Washington, but it now costs 54 bucks. That is a poll tax, right. That is a poll tax, right. You know, when I think about some of these requirements, like, I think about, you know, does it pass my Oma test. You know, I also think about some of the Tribes in my district. I represent a district with 12 Tribes. Folks from Tribal Nations have every right to participate in our democracy and the voting process; however, Tribal enrollment cards, which are used in Washington State as official identification, do not necessarily contain information about citizenship. Folks from Tribal Nations should not also be forced to pay poll tax to participate in democracy. I would love to get your thoughts and just have you share more about impacts of this SAVE Act when it comes to voters' access to what is their right. Mr. Waldman. Well, you are exactly right that there are so many voters who have been voting for decades who are eligible voters who would be adversely affected by a requirement that you show a passport or certified birth certificate or naturalization papers to vote. These are people who have been living up to their responsibility to vote, like your grandmother, over so many years who would suddenly find themselves unable to do so. In the States where this was briefly in effect, we saw tens of thousands of eligible voters being unable to vote. Mr. Kilmer. Eligible voters. Mr. Waldman. Yes. You mentioned Tribal voters from Tribal Nations are much less likely, for example, as I understand it, to have birth certificates of a kind that would be treated as acceptable here. I am not opposed and we are not opposed, for example, to voter ID. What we are opposed to is requiring ID that lots of people do not have. If we want to have a system that is secure and fair, that only eligible voters can vote, it is easy to do. Unfortunately, these proposals, and this one is one of them, are crafted in such a way to make it harder for some people to vote. In addition, more and more we are seeing rumors spread by leaders---- Chairman Steil. The gentleman's time has expired. Mr. Waldman . to make people doubt the veracity of their elections. Mr. Kilmer. Thank you. Thanks. I yield back. Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back. Mr. Carey is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Carey. I want to thank the Chairman. I want to thank my dear friend, the Ranking Member, for doing this hearing today. I want to thank all of you for traveling in to do this hearing. Ms. Sutherland, I am going to focus a lot of my questions-- a lot of them are going to be parochial, as I am from the State of Ohio, the great State of Ohio. Can you talk a little about your organization's recent report that the Sixteen Thirty Fund poured almost, if my numbers are correct or the staff's numbers are correct, roughly $15 million in 8 months in Ohio on different ballot initiatives. Can you kind of just discuss what that was for and where that money came from? Ms. Sutherland. That is right. The group in question, the Sixteen Thirty Fund, is the same group that counts Hansjorg Wyss as one of their top donors. They have been the beneficiary of about a quarter of a billion dollars in foreign cash. Sixteen Thirty Fund turns around and spends it on a lot of things. Mr. Carey. Let me ask you real quick, what is the Sixteen Thirty Fund? What is it? Ms. Sutherland. The Sixteen Thirty Fund is D.C.-based 501(c)(4). Mr. Carey. It is not Ohio-based? Ms. Sutherland. It is not Ohio-based. Mr. Carey. It is spending all of this money in the State of Ohio. Why is that? Ms. Sutherland. Yes. Sixteen Thirty Fund targeted the State of Ohio to make it easier to amend your State's constitution. Mr. Carey. Again, not an Ohio organization but an organization that is based out of D.C. that is targeting Ohio. Am I correct with that? Ms. Sutherland. That is correct. Mr. Carey. Where are the funders? Ms. Sutherland. Well, their top funders I have outlaid is-- -- Mr. Carey. Are they coming from Ohio? Ms. Sutherland. They are actually coming from---- Mr. Carey. Are they not coming from Ohio? That is all I want to know. Ms. Sutherland. They are coming from, one of them, is coming from Switzerland, a foreign national. Mr. Carey. They are from Switzerland? Ms. Sutherland. Yes. Mr. Carey. You are targeting at Ohio? Ms. Sutherland. Yes. Mr. Carey. With $16 million. How is that, and why is that right. Ms. Sutherland. Well, so they are taking advantage of what we have outlaid as this foreign influence loophole where foreign nationals can give to ballot issues, both directly and indirectly. What we have seen is Sixteen Thirty Fund and their foreign-backed cash targeting Ohio. Mr. Carey. Is not that wrong? Ms. Sutherland. Absolutely. Mr. Carey. Let me ask you this. How has the Ohio legislature had any success in moving any legislation forward? I mean, I know these individuals. They are very dear friends of mine, but are they moving any legislation forward that prohibits this conduct by foreign nationals? Ms. Sutherland. I actually had the opportunity just a couple months ago to testify in support of legislation in Ohio that would close this foreign influence loophole to prohibit foreign nationals from contributing to State ballot issues. It actually passed the State senate, and it was actually recently taken up again. Ohio paired this legislation with getting Biden on the ballot. Unfortunately, every single Democrat in the Ohio State had voted to keep Joe Biden off the ballot in favor of keeping the foreign dark money flowing in Ohio. Mr. Carey. We have got two ballot initiatives. You know, one is a redistricting ballot initiative, and one is a minimum wage ballot so they can destroy the restaurants like they did here in D.C. Tell me, do you think that is going to have a big influence in terms of the amount of money that is going to go into the State on these ballot initiatives? Ms. Sutherland. Absolutely. What we also see on these State ballot issues is that they are weaponized, and they turn out the vote to shore up the vote to support these liberal-leaning ballot issues and help the top of the ticket as well. Mr. Carey. Let me just--I mean, I only have a minute and 26 seconds left, but so, if Congress or the Ohio legislature does not act to prohibit this national involvement in our State or local ballot initiatives between now and November--and you pretty much said it, but I am going to let you get another chance at the apple here--this conduct will continue. Am I correct? Ms. Sutherland. Absolutely. Mr. Carey. In finalization, can you talk just a little bit about what you are seeing in other States? I mean, I know Ohio. $16 million is a lot of money. What are we seeing in some of the other States? Ms. Sutherland. We are seeing right now that the Sixteen Thirty Fund is actively spending in many States. They are actively spending in Ohio. They are actively spending in Missouri, Nevada, and Montana. Mr. Carey. Is there any reason--I mean, my goodness. Is there any reason that they would be picking these States to spend some money in? What do you think it is? Ms. Sutherland. Yes. If you take a look at the States that the Sixteen Thirty Fund has targeted for these ballot issues, you can tell that they are key Presidential States and often has a competitive U.S. Senate race concurrent with the ballot issue that they are trying to advance. Mr. Carey. All right. Well, thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back. Mrs. Torres is recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. Torres. Thank you, Chairman. I think it seems like we have forgotten, you know, the fact that the Russians have so much influence in our Presidential election and that the former President and current candidate for President, the Republican nominee, specifically asked the Russians for help in his last election. Here we are again witnessing another attempt to undermine a free and fair and secure American election by continuing to sow doubt ahead of the 2024 election. I think that we should be clear about the credibility of the Republican witnesses that we have in front of us today. I ask, Mr. Chairman, for unanimous consent to enter into the record two documents: one, an article from NBC, headline ``Vote Fraud Crusader J. Christian Adams Sparks Outrage''; and an article from the Law and Crime, headline ``Former Trump Voting Commissioner Official Forced to Apologize for Falsely Accusing People of Voter Fraud.''   Mrs. Torres. Mr. Adams has a history of making unfounded allegations about illegal voting allegations that were so egregious and so damaging to innocent people and families that a Federal court had to step in, a Federal court in 2016 and 2017. Mr. Adams published two reports called ``Alien Invasion in Virginia'' that states that thousands of people, thousands of people had illegally registered to vote in Virginia. The report contained an appendix that contained the voter registration forms of alleged noncitizens, including their names, home addresses, and telephone numbers. This blatant attempt to intimidate voters was so egregious that a Federal court forced Mr. Adams to provide a written apology on behalf of himself and his organization, PILF. The Court also forced PILF to include the following disclaimer: ``PILF recognizes that individuals in,'' you know, exhibit whatever, ``were, in fact, in fact, citizens and that these citizens did not commit felonies but were subject to your abuse. PILF profoundly regrets any characterization of those registrants as felons or instances of registration or voting as felonies.'' It is stunning, stunning that this is the type of behavior and witness that we have in front of us today and that the majority has brought to us and that these are the witnesses you seem to think have any credibility on any of these issues. Mr. Waldman, it is exhausting to be in this Committee dealing with these types of issues. To your knowledge, is there any evidence that noncitizen voting has ever affected the outcome, the outcome of any election? Mr. Waldman. I am not aware of any evidence that noncitizen voting has affected the outcome of any Federal elections. I will note that the hearing record that Mr. von Spakovsky keeps waving around is from a quarter century ago. Since then, Congress passed the Help America Vote Act, and States happily have vastly improved and greatly upgraded their systems, their voter registration rolls, and the use of computers. Back then, it was paper records. States and officials of both parties have upgraded, and they should not be subject to felony. Mrs. Torres. Absolutely. What would you estimate the chances of noncitizens voting affecting the outcome of the 2024 upcoming election? Mr. Waldman. There is no reason to think, based on facts, not intuition, that noncitizen voting will affect the outcome of this or any other Federal election of significance. Mrs. Torres. Like millions of Americans, I was horrified, Mr. Chairman, and disgusted by the violent, deadly attack on the Capitol that happened on January 6, 2021. What made the attack terrifying was that, on top of the threat to our democracy and on top of the threat to the peaceful transfer of power, the violent insurrection targeted us, Members of Congress and staff who were here working that day. It is our job, as Members of this Committee, to ensure that nothing like this ever, ever happens again. Mr. Waldman, is there any connection between the lies that the former President and these witnesses or some of these witnesses have stated in an attempt to steal the 2020 election and the lies about noncitizens voting at this hearing is spreading today? What would be the impact to this upcoming election? Mr. Waldman. False allegations about widespread misconduct spurred the January 6th insurrection even though court after court, 63 courts rejected it. It has spurred unwise voting laws, and I am very worried it is going to be a factor in this election. Mrs. Torres. My time is up. Thank you. I am going to yield back, but I am going to say, should another insurrection occur, it will be at the hands of this Committee membership that continues to spread lies about our honest and free elections. I yield back. Chairman Steil. The gentlewoman's time has expired. Ms. Lee is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to our witnesses for your testimony and for being here with us today. Secretary Byrd, I would like to return to your testimony and hear more about the specific safeguards that Florida has in place to prevent noncitizens from voting and what the Federal Government needs to do to help equip State and local election officials to conduct lawful, accurate elections. In 2020, Florida's constitution was amended to specifically ensure that only U.S. citizens can vote in Florida, correct? Mr. Byrd. That is correct. Ms. Lee. That passed with over almost 80 percent of the vote in Florida. Is not that right? Mr. Byrd. That is actually right. Ms. Lee. Now, you testified earlier about something called the SAVE data base that is in the possession of the Department of Homeland Security, but you mentioned that it was both overly expensive and inefficient, in essence, for State and local election officials to use. Would you tell us a little bit more about that data base and some of the things that make it less than optimal for your use as an election officials? Mr. Byrd. Thank you. Yes, so the SAVE data base is both inefficient due to time and in accuracy. It costs States, for every transaction, and for some voters, it is multiple transactions, so it is a financial burden on the States to gain information that only the Federal Government has that we compel the States to comply with under Federal law. By the time an election can come and before we have had the opportunity to gain all of the information, a noncitizen who made it onto the rolls could gain access to the vote before we have time to remove them. Ms. Lee. Would it be helpful if there was not a fee associated with accessing that data base? Mr. Byrd. Absolutely. Ms. Lee. In your opinion, should that data base and could that data base be more complete and more accurate? Mr. Byrd. Yes. It should be more accessible to every State and to local voting administrators. Ms. Lee. You also touched on information about when a person is naturalized and then should be accessing, should be an eligible voter. Is that information that is promptly and reliably provided to you as an election official from the Federal Government? Mr. Byrd. It is not. That is one of the things that we are requesting that Congress consider is making that information available on a regular basis to States, everyone who is naturalized, so we can run that data base of new citizens against our existing voter registration roll. Ms. Lee. Mr. Adams testified earlier about information that exists in the Federal courts when individuals report for jury duty. Is there information there as well that would be useful to you if it were, in fact, provided to State and local election officials? Mr. Byrd. Yes. Any information that is in the possession of any branch of the Federal Government regarding citizenship status would be helpful to the States. Ms. Lee. Are there other provisions of the NVRA that in your view would be helpful if amended? Mr. Byrd. Most significantly it is the issue of who has become a naturalized citizen. Also, as you know as my predecessor as secretary of the State of Florida, in a Presidential election year, which we are in, there are three periods: the Presidential preference primary, the primary in August, and then the election in November. There is a provision in the NVRA that prohibits States from doing certain list maintenance 90 days before each of those elections. That is 270 days out of this Presidential election year in which States are prohibited from engaging in certain voter list maintenance activity, and we think that should be stopped. Ms. Lee. Thank you, Secretary Byrd. Mr. Adams, I want to return to you. You featured very prominently in some comments just a moment ago. I wanted to give you an opportunity to share your perspective and respond. Mr. Adams. Thank you, Representative Lee. First of all, I see Representative Torres has hit and run. This is endemic of cancel culture where anyone who talks about these issues is attacked. Her recitation of the record was grotesquely inadequate, and, in fact, what we published were public records from the Commonwealth of Virginia about noncitizens who were removed from the rolls, or purported noncitizens. I have here from Virginia's Department of Elections commentary about our work. It said, ``It is worth noting there were some issues that we had with delivery of the DMV noncitizen file.'' They have since corrected these issues. In other words, we found the problem in Virginia list maintenance involving the improper cancellation of Americans. Representative Torres, were she still here, should be glad that public records have been corrected as a result of these cases that we discovered. Ms. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Chairman Steil. The gentlewoman yields back. In consultation with the Ranking Member, we will each make brief closing remarks before we conclude the hearing. I will yield to the Ranking Member. Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate you giving me a couple minutes here just to gather some of my thoughts. I think one of the reasons I think we are so concerned about this is there are already doubts being cast on the 2024 election by leading Republicans. Senator Lindsey Graham said he would accept the results of the election only if there was no massive cheating, which has never been proven, despite claims in 2020. Earlier this month, two of former President Trump's potential running mates, Senator Tim Scott and Governor Doug Burgum of North Dakota, declined to commit to accepting the results. Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, I saw him on television the other day at CNN, said he would only honor the outcome if the election was free and fair, but Republicans should be ready to pursue any problems. The list goes on. Even my colleague from New York, Representative Stefanik, refused to commit to certify voting results in 2024. Byron Donalds said he would not necessarily certify the 2028 election results if he were Vice President. It goes on and on. We are panicked because, in the 250 years of this country's existence, in this Republic, people have routinely, on both sides of the aisle, both sides of any partisan debate, have always accepted election results, until 2020. The former President continues to this day to cast doubt. In fact, one of the things I also wanted to point out is we suggested authorizing up to $5 billion over the next 10 years to put money into State and local elections to help local election officials and State officials do the job to the best of their ability and have not had support for that. Frankly, even the ERIC tool, which is a nonpartisan organization that helps States ensure security and integrity of voter rolls by collecting data from various State sources, including DMVs and election offices, you know, the former President went on a rave about--sort of conspiracy-fueled about ERIC and its partisanship with no evidence at all. Because people feel compelled to follow every single thing he says, they have to run like rats out of an aqueduct to try to keep up with the insanity. I have great respect for my colleague Laura Lee. She said of ERIC in 2019 when she was Florida's secretary of State, ``Joining ERIC keeps Florida at the forefront of election security and will help us ensure a fair and accurate election in 2020 and beyond.'' I note then the former President said, ``We are not for ERIC anymore.'' Your successor who is here, the secretary of State, caused Florida to leave ERIC--the bipartisan, nonpartisan effort to do this. In fact, even you, Mr. Adams, a witness today, said there was no adequate alternative to ERIC, declaring, this is a quote, ``There is no replacement right now. People are trying and hoping. I am hoping for a Lamborghini.'' Hopefully you got one, I hope, Mr. Adams, for your sake. You even called out snake oil salesmen pushing the nonexistent replacement to ERIC. We are desperately concerned about notions that, even here we are, 3 and a half years later, the former President continuing to insist that there is fraud in a 2020 election despite the countless lawsuits, all the evidence to the contrary. We are still doing this, which is why we are panicked about 2024. To say this hearing, again, we believe is a pretext for starting a reverse engineer of Y-2024: ``We are going to call into question. We do not have any data about it.'' Frankly, there is so much we can be doing to ensure all Americans vote. I apologize. I am taking a few extra seconds here, and I appreciate that. We are just very, very concerned. We know, for instance, that the research methodology of the studies referenced by Mr. von Spakovsky's testimony were immediately and convincingly rebutted upon publication by experts of the survey data used in the study. It has been a decade now, and in a decade since, the authors of that data have not published a defense of their research that is compelling enough to make it through review, peer review, or surveys of any serious scrutiny. I think we all know this. I hope my majority colleagues know this. Some people might say that they just do not care. I hope--no, honestly, I pray that this is not true. As far as I can tell, none of the majority Members of this Committee, the main Committee of jurisdiction for the bill that we are talking about today attended the Speaker's now infamous press conference to introduce the so-called SAVE Act, an Orwellian name if I have ever heard one. That was last week. As of 10 a.m. this morning, at least according to Congress.gov, only one of the Members of this Committee has signed on to the bill. I take that as a good sign. I hope this means, at the very least, most of my colleagues on this Committee are unwilling to entwine their names for posterity to these obvious lies to this disgraceful effort to subvert and downgrade our Republic. I think they know deep down, as I do, what is happening here, and I think the rest of us know it too. With that, I yield back. Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back. I thank our witnesses for being here today. I think what we have fleshed out is the real significant issue that noncitizen voting is playing in instilling confidence in our elections. As we have done over the course of the past 18 months in this Committee, we have explored areas where we can improve our confidence in our elections. We did a hearing in Atlanta, Georgia, to show exactly what took place when Georgia passed a voter integrity bill that enhanced integrity in their elections. Contrary to what President Biden claimed and many on the left claimed, what we actually saw was great participation in Georgia, by many analyses, participation actually increasing in the State. The University of Georgia did a comprehensive study of that election, and what we got back was great data, that people were actually very pleased with how the elections were conducted and operated, which tells me that, as we increase confidence in our election, we actually increase participation. What we have done is fleshed out, as Hans von Spakovsky has shown us, this has been an issue that has plagued elections for some time. In an election over 20 years ago, this House Committee showed numerous noncitizens voting. Then, in a more recent era, we have Washington, D.C., aggressively not only allowing noncitizens to vote, in particular, for mayor and other key elections in the city but so much as actively encouraging noncitizens to vote, so much so sending out a postcard at taxpayer expense encouraging noncitizens to vote in our Nation's Capital. To do so, one would only need to reside in Washington, D.C., for 30 days. As we look at ways to increase Americans' confidence in our elections between now and the November election, I think this should be an area where folks on the left should actually be willing to work with us to make sure that we are addressing these concerns, to maintain that U.S. elections are for U.S. citizens, to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls, to secure our election and increase Americans' confidence in their election because I believe, as we increase confidence in our elections, more individuals are willing to participate, and more participation in our elections is a good thing. Before we leave, I also have a real concern with what the Biden administration has done, in particular, as it relates to Executive Order 14.019. What they have done is worked to weaponize all Federal agencies on behalf of President Biden's reelection campaign. I am sending a letter to every Cabinet official in the Biden administration, in particular, as it relates to this executive order. Our Federal agency should be focused on serving the American people, not focused on reelecting President Biden. As we see the actions taken by this administration to leverage taxpayer dollars for political purposes, that should be concerning to all citizens. I look forward to the reply from these letters from every Cabinet Secretary in the Biden administration. I appreciate all of our witnesses for being here. I appreciate the Ranking Member and all Members of the Committee for their participation. Members of the Committee may have some additional questions for our witnesses. We ask you to respond to those questions in writing. Without objection, each Member will have 5 legislative days to insert additional material into the record or to revise and extend their remarks. If there is no further business, I want to thank the Members for their participation. Without objection, the Committee stands adjourned.
