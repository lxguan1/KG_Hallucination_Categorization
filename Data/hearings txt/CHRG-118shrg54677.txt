THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AT THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS,
GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE,
AND SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION
----------
WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 24, 2024
United States Senate
Committee on Rules and Administration
Washington, DC.
The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:15 p.m., in
Room 301, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Amy Klobuchar,
Chairwoman of the Committee, presiding.
Present: Senators Klobuchar, Fischer, Padilla, Ossoff,
Capito, Hagerty, and Britt.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HONORABLE AMY KLOBUCHAR,
CHAIRWOMAN, A UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM
THE STATE OF MINNESOTA
Chairwoman Klobuchar. Calling this hearing to order. Good
afternoon. I would like to thank Ranking Member Fischer, as
always, and our colleagues for helping us put together this
hearing. With us today is Dr. Carla Hayden, who is the
Librarian of Congress. Thank you. We always enjoy having you
here.
Also here is Hugh Halpern, the Director of the Government
Publishing Office. Back again, thank you. As well as Meroe
Park, thank you for being here, the Deputy Secretary and Chief
Operating Officer of the Smithsonian. We understand that the
Secretary is ill. Just--he will recover but was not able to
make it, so we really appreciate it.
Today, we are going to talk about the very important topic
of artificial intelligence and the agencies that play such a
critical role in serving the American people. AI has the
potential, as we know, to lead to incredible innovation by
supercharging scientific research, improving access to
information, and increasing productivity. But like any emerging
technology, AI comes with significant risks and our laws need
to be as sophisticated, as the potential threats are there to
our own democracy.
Understanding these risks and benefits has been a major
bipartisan focus of the Senate, with Senators Schumer, Rounds,
Young, and Heinrich leading a series of nine forums since the
fall, and a number of us on various committees working on
proposals so that we are going to be ready when this hits.
I think, as you all saw from the reports of the robocalls
in New Hampshire with the fake voice of the President or other
things that
]
have also occurred to candidates on the Republican side of the
aisle, this is not going to be one side or another. It is
something that we as a Congress have to deal with to put some
guardrails. That includes, of course, the work that goes on in
these agencies.
At our hearing in September, all the witnesses agreed that
AI poses risks to our elections, and we heard testimony on why
we must work to put guardrails in place. That is why I am
leading a bipartisan bill with Senators Hawley, Coons, Collins,
and also joined with Senators Bennet and Ricketts, to prohibit
fraudulent AI-generated content in our elections within the
framework of the Constitution, for instance, allowing for
satire and the like, and why we need to take other steps like
disclaimers on ads that use AI so that the citizens of this
country can actually believe that it is their own candidate or
their opposing candidate who is speaking.
Another example of legislation going on. Senator Thune and
I have joined together in introducing a bill to put in place
commonsense safeguards for the highest risk, non-defense
applications of AI, and improve transparency. I see that
Senator Capito is here. She has also joined us on this
important bill that is mostly coming out of the Commerce
Committee.
Let us get to your stuff, AI and how it affects the work of
the three agencies before us, the Library of Congress,
Government Publishing Office, and the Smithsonian. While it is
important that our three witnesses today speak to measures they
are taking to safeguard against potential harms, they are also,
I think it is important to note, using AI technology in their
work to protect our country's greatest treasures, advance
scientific research, and improve public access to information.
For example, the Library of Congress is testing emerging AI
technology to expand how researchers can better use the
resources they already house in their collections, which make
up the largest library in the world, we note with much
humbleness, such as a new AI tool that lets users instantly
search through 1.56 million images from digitized historical
newspapers to assist in archival research.
GPO is working to harness the efficiencies offered by AI to
modernize how it makes information from all three branches of
government more usable for the public since much of its work
has expanded to digital publishing, hence their new name,
printing to publishing.
As part of its work producing government documents, GPO is
using AI to ensure quality control of items such as the
material you use to print passports. It printed 22 million of
them, as we learned at the last hearing last year.
Finally, at the Smithsonian, which is the world's largest
museum, education, and research complex, researchers are
exploring how to use AI to do things like tackle some of the
most challenging problems in astrophysics, classify species of
fish in the Amazon, and make collections more accessible,
accurately identifying the contributions of women, I like this
one, in historical texts, in which they were often identified
in writing by only their husbands' names. That will be
interesting what you discover with AI.
We must continue working to stay ahead of the curve, and I
am committed to working in a bipartisan way with Senator
Fischer so that our country can benefit, and your agencies can
benefit from
]
the best of AI, while protecting against any threats. Thank you
again, and I will turn it over to Senator Fischer.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HONORABLE DEB FISCHER, A UNITED STATES
SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEBRASKA
Senator Fischer. Thank you, Chairwoman Klobuchar, for
calling this hearing on The use of Artificial Intelligence at
the Library of Congress, the Government Publishing Office, and
the Smithsonian. I also want to thank our three witnesses who
are here with us today.
I know we are all wishing Secretary Bunch a speedy
recovery. I believe this is the first time the Committee has
heard from the Library of Congress, the Government Publishing
Office, and the Smithsonian at the same time, and Director
Halpern, it is nice to see you back with us so soon.
The Library of Congress and the Smithsonian both safeguard
a vast collection of our Nation's treasures, welcome our
constituents to their beautiful buildings to learn and explore,
and serve as crucial resources to the scientific and the
academic communities.
The Government Publishing Office also performs vital
functions for the American people as it produces, distributes,
preserves, and publishes documents for all three branches of
our government.
This is the Rules Committee's second hearing on the use of
AI. As we discussed at the first hearing, there is no question
that AI is transformative, and it is poised to evolve rapidly.
While AI brings the possibility of creating efficiencies and
competitive advantages across government, it also creates
risks.
Understanding and weighing the benefits and risks of AI are
necessary first steps before widely adopting the use of AI.
Today, I look forward to hearing from our witnesses about how
our legislative branch agencies are exploring potential
applications of AI.
There are many important questions to ask, such as are
these existing issues or specific challenges at our legislative
branch agencies that AI could solve? Are there existing
services that our agencies provide that AI could improve? Can
AI provide new avenues for these agencies so that you can
fulfill your missions?
I also look forward to hearing about the guardrails our
agencies are putting in place to mitigate those risks of AI. We
need to understand the cost of AI and AI's impacts on agencies'
budgets.
Just as importantly, agencies need to understand the
implications of AI use, especially the risks related to
privacy. Understanding legislative branch agencies' use of AI
is an important oversight question for this Committee. That
said, we cannot lose sight of existing challenges facing the
agencies that we oversee.
As the Library looks to hire a new director for the
Congressional Research Service, and GPO seeks to maintain high
quality staffing standards in the face of your retiring work
force, it is important that this Committee supports their
efforts to improve hiring and retention efforts.
Furthermore, as the Smithsonian endeavors to establish two
new museums authorized by statute, we must maintain rigorous
oversight of their efforts to tackle a deferred maintenance
backlog, a chronic issue for that agency.
]
With that said, I look forward to a productive discussion
about our legislative branch agencies' use of AI, as well as
other issues that you face. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Chairwoman Klobuchar. Well, thank you so much, Senator
Fischer. I will introduce our witnesses. Our first witness, as
I noted, is Librarian of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden.
Dr. Hayden was sworn in in September 2016. She has done a
tremendous job leading the Library. She previously served as
the CEO of Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore, and she
received her undergraduate degree from Roosevelt University,
and master's and Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, that I
also attended.
Whenever I see Dr. Hayden, I always think about Barbara
Mikulski, who was so proud that a Baltimore librarian got this
job, and you have made her proud too. Thank you.
Our second witness is Director of the Government Publishing
Office, Hugh Halpern, who has been in his position since his
unanimous confirmation, it does not happen all the time, by the
Senate in December 2019.
He previously worked on Capitol Hill for more than 30
years, including for former Speaker Paul Ryan. He received his
bachelor's and master's degrees from American University, and
his law degree from George Mason. Thank you, and we really
enjoyed your attendance at your last hearing.
Our final witness is Meroe Park, who became Deputy
Secretary and Chief Operating Officer of the Smithsonian in
December 2019. Previously, she worked for 27 years at the CIA.
Okay, I did not know that. When I read these bios, I learn new
things all the time. You probably do not advertise that, but
that is interesting. Including as executive director and chief
operating officer, and she received her undergraduate degree
from Georgetown.
Okay, now we are going to swear in the witnesses. Okay, if
you raise your right hand, do you swear that the testimony you
will give before the Committee shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Dr. Hayden. I do.
Mr. Halpern. I do.
Ms. Park. I do.
Chairwoman Klobuchar. Thank you, and you can be seated. We
will now proceed to five minute testimonies. We will start with
Dr. Hayden.
OPENING STATEMENT OF DOCTOR CARLA HAYDEN,
LIBRARIAN OF CONGRESS, LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, WASHINGTON, DC
Dr. Hayden. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, Ranking Member
Fischer, and Members of the Committee. Thank you for this
invitation to appear before you to discuss a topic that is of
great interest across the government and within the public
archives sector, artificial intelligence.
I am pleased to have the opportunity to further engage with
my legislative branch colleagues on this topic and to update
the Committee on the Library's activities exploring AI. At the
Library, there are four areas of focus with AI, to expand
access to our collections, to enhance services for users, to
improve internal processes
]
for increased efficiency, and to implement a slate of strong
governance for the use of AI.
Becoming a more digitally enabled agency has been a key
focus of my tenure as Librarian. In 2019, the Library published
a comprehensive digital strategy to guide the agency's use of
technology in an increasingly digital world. Building on this
first major step, we have now fully integrated our digital
strategy into our 2024-2028 strategic plan, and the plan
embraces a central idea, that technology must be, as our CIO,
Judith Conklin says, baked into all we do. Since 2018, the
Library's Digital Innovation Division, also affectionately
known as LC Labs, has investigated AI and shared the results of
its research experiments with the public.
Working with digital researchers we call Innovators in
Residence, LC Labs has made its mark as a launch pad for
innovating engaging uses of AI to expand access to our
collections. A very popular example is Citizen DJ, a music
sampling application that allows users to remix and create
music using free-to-use non rights restricted audio from the
Library's collections.
Other exciting AI use cases include experimenting with
machine learning and optical character recognition, or OCR, to
help manage metadata and machine readable text for digitized
documents.
For example, OCR has increased the discoverability of more
than 20 million historic American newspaper pages through the
Chronicling America Project. Building on that technology, users
can also search those historic newspapers for photos using an
application LC Labs rolled out in 2020 called Newspaper
Navigator.
Enhancing services to Congress and the public is also a
major area of focus. In 2022, we released a Congress.gov API,
application programing interface, to make it easier for the
public to access and use accurate, structured Congressional
Legislative data.
Additionally, several Library service units are
successfully demonstrating AI's use in bolstering the Library's
information services. Our digital innovators have been working
with the Copyright Office to test approaches for extracting
data from historical copyright records.
This project combines human skills with AI capacity to make
a written or handwritten analog record more accessible and
easier to search online, and it is just one example of how
humans in the loop can be the model for AI and successful
integration of technology with human skill, because a very
important principle is that well trained human beings will
always be critical to the work of the Library of Congress.
Now, the Library's AI use cases have also been testing
opportunities to increase efficiency and staff productivity.
For example, our Cataloging Division is currently experimenting
with AI to help staff more efficiently process bibliographic
information and catalog records.
There are many opportunities with AI, but there also must
be robust governance. The Library is in a strong position as
our existing technology governance policies provide an
adaptable foundation to use in guiding us with emerging
technologies like AI. Further, the Library's approach to
implementing AI closely aligns with the practices of other
federal institutions and is informed by NIST's AI Risk
]
Management Framework, which also aims to improve the
trustworthiness of AI applications.
Responding to this fast developing area of technology calls
for collaboration across the private sector and government,
which is why the Library participates in the General Services
Administration AI Community of Practice and is a leading member
of the International Artificial Intelligence for Libraries,
Archives and Museums Secretariat.
To conclude, discovering the role AI has to play in
enhancing services to Congress and other users remains an
ongoing effort. As the Library of Congress charts this course
forward, we plan to draw on our history of technological
innovations, our rigorous development of standards, and the
input of our stakeholders and partners to align possible uses
for the public.
We appreciate this opportunity, and we hope that you will
join with us in making sure the values of transparency,
accountability, and efficacy remain as we explore this
opportunity.
[The prepared statement of Dr. Hayden was submitted for the
record.]
Chairwoman Klobuchar. Thank you. Mr. Halpern.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HONORABLE HUGH NATHANIAL
HALPERN, DIRECTOR, UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE,
WASHINGTON, DC
Mr. Halpern. Thank you. Good afternoon, Chairwoman
Klobuchar, Ranking Member Fischer, Senator Capito. It is always
good to see you. I am pleased to appear before you today to
share some of the potential uses of AI and related technologies
at the Government Publishing Office.
GPO differs from the Library and the Smithsonian in that it
is fundamentally a manufacturing operation. We publish,
produce, and maintain materials for all three branches of
government.
Our 1,600 craftspeople and professionals produce virtually
all of Congress's documents, along with numerous other
publications, and manufacture secure credential products like
the United States passport. We also provide digital information
either through our own trusted digital repository, Govinfo.gov,
or by serving data to our partners like the Library where they
use that data on sites like Congress.gov.
No matter what you call it, artificial intelligence,
machine learning, or a large language model, GPO's operations
are just as susceptible to disruption as any commercial firms,
and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
My written testimony describes GPO's policy approach to
this new generation of tools, so my statement today will focus
on three potential applications for AI and related technologies
in our day-to-day operations.
First, we believe these tools can improve our quality
assurance process by automatically recognizing defects that a
human inspector might miss. We already use a rudimentary form
of this technology in the production of the current version of
the United States passport. GPO uses equipment that optically
scans the pages that will become the identity page in a
personalized passport.
]
This equipment looks at each strip of three pages for
variances that exceed the specifications for the material and
rejects those pages that do not conform to the standard. AI
technology has the potential to further refine this review,
allowing the machines to learn what may constitute a natural
variation that is within the specification and what is not.
This has the potential to reduce defect rates, lower waste,
and free up our quality assurance team to focus on solving
bigger quality problems as they arise.
Second, we see tremendous potential for supplementing our
proofreading team. Proofreaders are very difficult to hire, and
we need to free them from making routine, repetitive
corrections and allow them to focus on more subtle issues that
really require a human being to interpret.
One example is capitalization. GPO style says that we
capitalize the letter ``s'' in the word ``state'' when we are
referring to a political subdivision of the United States.
Currently, we use computer scripts to perform global search and
replace functions on documents to correct our most common
errors, including that one. But those scripts are really blunt
instruments.
For instance, they cannot tell the difference between the
``State of Minnesota'' and a ``New York state of mind.'' AI
holds the promise of tools that understand context and know
when text refers to one kind of state or the other. That will
cut down on the need for our proofreaders to review and re-
review, and then correct material that has already been run
through our automated tools, and free them up to focus on more
difficult contextual issues.
My final example comes from GPO's public information
mission. We have had great success in making congressionally
mandated reports publicly available since the end of last year,
with more than 180 of those reports available on GovInfo as of
yesterday.
Most of those reports come to us as PDFs. While that is a
good format to show how the printed document looks, it is not
always the best format for viewing on a phone, a tablet, or
even for folks with disabilities.
While GPO would like to get these reports in more flexible
formats like XML, the agencies authoring reports are not always
equipped to supply them that way. AI technologies hold the
promise of allowing us to extract the information from a PDF,
understand the document structure, and produce an alternative
view that works on different kinds of devices, all without
manual, time consuming work from our team.
These are just three examples where we see applications in
GPO's operations, and we are considering many pilots in the
future. All of these are intended to act as a force multiplier
for our team, allowing our folks to be more productive, and
deliver a higher value for our customers and the taxpayer.
Madam Chairwoman, Ranking Member Fischer, thank you for the
opportunity to testify before the Committee today. I look
forward to any questions the Committee may have.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Halpern was submitted for
the record.]
Chairwoman Klobuchar. Thank you very much. Last but not
least, Ms. Park, thank you.
]
OPENING STATEMENT OF MEROE PARK, DEPUTY SECRETARY
AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
WASHINGTON, DC
Ms. Park. Thank you. Thank you for the opportunity to
present today. I will pass along your well wishes to the
Secretary. Early in our time as an institution, we collected
meteorological data from volunteers nationwide via telegraph.
Fast forward to a few years ago, when we helped create the
first image of a black hole at the center of the Milky Way. In
short, we have always embraced revolutionary technology, from
the locomotive to the pocket watch, from the telegraph to the
internet, and artificial intelligence is no different.
Throughout the institution, scientific uses of machine
learning are actually quite common, applying it to the
identification of exoplanets, tracing the evolutionary history
of pollen, and conducting field research in conservation. In
other words, artificial intelligence has been around the
Smithsonian for almost a decade. What has changed is the
widespread availability of generative AI.
These widely available applications of AI hold great
promise, from making us more efficient and effective as an
organization, to improving the visitor experience and extending
our reach across the Nation. We are learning from our current
use cases and are exploring new ones as this technology
continues to evolve.
For example, the National Museum of African American
History and Culture's Freedmen's Bureau Transcription Project,
which is the Smithsonian's largest crowd sourcing initiative,
is transcribing genealogical records of the formerly enslaved.
In a recent trial run, AI tools reliably transcribed nearly two
thirds of the test content, showing how AI has the ability to
dramatically scale up work with large data sets.
Other examples, including, as the Chairwoman mentioned
during her opening remarks, our data science labs' development
of a model that can discover incorrect women's contributions
mistakenly attributed to men in our collections.
The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatories Astro AI Center
has more than 50 AI projects planned or underway, creating
excitement about our solar system and the universe itself.
Inside the Smithsonian, we recently announced the creation
of an AI Community of Practice, which will help us test new
capabilities across the institution, as well as build a
framework of good governance to determine the best way to use
AI effectively and responsibly.
People rely on our reputation as a trustworthy reservoir of
knowledge, so we understand concerns about bias, ethics,
safety, and accuracy in available AI outcomes, but there are
also fantastic opportunities as well. We and other cultural
institutions can collaborate with technology leaders to help
improve AI tools for everyone.
We can also examine the many dimensions of AI from a
scholarly perspective, convening experts to examine its
ethical, social, and economic implications. The nation's 250th
birthday in 2026 will be a pivotal moment for us to experiment
with innovative AI tools, to enable collaboration with tech
leaders in other government and cul
]
tural organizations to make AI more reliable and trustworthy,
to educate people about the benefits and the risks of AI.
Ultimately, AI is a tool. Used properly, it will allow the
Smithsonian to expand our reach and our impact. Like any new
technology, it comes with risks and the potential for
unintended consequences. But by developing internal expertise
and partnering with external experts, we can thoughtfully
leverage AI, both for the Smithsonian and for the American
public. Thank you.
[The prepared statement of Ms. Park was submitted for the
record.]
Chairwoman Klobuchar. Thank you very much. I am going to
turn it over to Senator Fischer and--for her questions, and
then Senator Padilla.
Senator Fischer. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. Thank you all
once again for being here today. Can each of you share whether
your respective agencies have an official policy that governs
its use of AI? Dr. Hayden, do you have an official policy on
that?
Dr. Hayden. Yes. The Library has a number of policies for
security, IT security in general, and we have an AI working
group that has developed guidelines.
We also follow the NIST's framework. We also are very
cognizant and use the Executive Orders that have also laid that
foundation. We are very, I would say zealous on making sure
that we have those frameworks and guidelines.
Senator Fischer. You mentioned in your oral testimony, it
is in your written as well, about NIST and it aims to improve
the trustworthiness of AI applications. Can you give me an
example of how that would be used? I think a lot of us, when we
think of AI, we do not get down to the nitty gritty.
We do not get down to the basics of what it really can do.
We just think, oh, this is going to be so wonderful. It will be
sorting data. I think this--I think some of your answers from
all of you would be very helpful on that.
Dr. Hayden. One of the through lines for each of us is
trustworthiness and with the Library of Congress, we take very
seriously being stewards of historic information and current
information so that we are a trusted source.
Working with the framework that includes looking at a new
technology, you map it, you explore, and then you measure its
usefulness and effectiveness. Then if it passes quite a few of
these things, you would look at how you could implement it.
Being able to make sure and having these templates, we have
questions that we pose when anything is being proposed. But
with AI in particular, we ask what does it do? How can we make
sure that humans are in the loop for their quality control? It
is a very important part of looking at AI in particular and any
newer technology.
Senator Fischer. Thank you. Mr. Halpern, can you let me
know if you--do you have a policy?
Mr. Halpern. Absolutely. We have a directive in place since
last month, since the end of 2023. One of the things that that
created was our AI Governance Committee, and I believe that
committee is going to have their first kickoff meeting on
Monday, where they are going to start evaluating different
technologies for some pilot
]
deployments in the near term so we can start testing some of
these in our environment.
Senator Fischer. You know, you mentioned in your testimony,
a lot of--the three interesting examples you gave of how you
are using AI right now.
How do you decide on a case-by-case basis when you are
ready to test that on that project, whether you think it is
safe at that point in time, or if you are just trying to gather
information?
Mr. Halpern. We already have a very robust system for
evaluating software and hardware for deployment at GPO.
Much of what we do is mission critical to the Congress, so
we need to make sure that anything we deploy does not interfere
with our ability to deliver for our customers, whether that is
the House or the Senate, or our State Department customer, or
any other customer.
This Governance Committee is another layer on top of that.
Looking at some of these new technologies, both to see if there
are improvements to the way we do things that can deliver
benefits to our customers and minimize the risk from those same
technologies of introducing variables into our product. For
instance----
Senator Fischer. What does that mean, the risks of
introducing variables--?
Mr. Halpern. We have all read about the issues with ChatGPT
hallucinating facts that are not there. The good news is GPO
does not generate a lot of public information. We make other
people's public information available.
Much of where we can leverage these technologies is really
in the quality assurance world. But, for the same reason you
need to double-check ChatGPT's output, we need to make sure
that the optical system that is checking the quality of our
passport identity pages is not introducing or missing quality
problems.
From that perspective, we really need to deploy these
systems in a limited way so that we can make sure they are
doing what they are advertised to do so that we are not
delivering a product to our customer that is of lesser quality
than it should be.
Senator Fischer. Can I have the Smithsonian response as
well.
Ms. Park. Of course.
Senator Fischer. Thank you. Ms. Park.
Ms. Park. Great. Thank you. I will address maybe two
aspects of your question. Internally at the Smithsonian, we
absolutely are focused on governance and also the sharing of
best practices.
This community of practice that we have formed is really
designed to do a number of things. One is to identify policies
that we already have that need to be updated with what is a
very quickly evolving technology. Also, things like protecting
privacy.
You asked about specific examples of how does this actually
play out in an organization. You have to make sure that if
employees are using ChatGPT or some other generative AI tool,
that we are thinking about how that data is being prepared and
made available to AI to analyze.
There is a lot of thought going into how we go about doing
that internally. Then externally, we also have a public
mandate, as several of my colleagues have talked about here, as
trusted sources for the American public.
]
We want to make sure that we are available to them, that we
have our 177 years of experience with history, culture,
science, education as a way to inform these tools, and also as
a way to help evaluate the accuracy of information.
So that is still aspirational for us at this point, but we
are thinking about both aspects of our internal governance, our
internal opportunities for efficiency, as well as our ability
to be a convener and to help in the more public realm.
Senator Fischer. Thank you.
Chairwoman Klobuchar. Okay, Senator Padilla. Thank you.
Senator Padilla. Thank you, Madam Chair. As I have had a
chance to share in this Committee before--before entering the
Senate, I served as California's Secretary of State, where a
part of the portfolio was serving as a custodian of the state's
archives.
At the time, I made it a priority to dramatically increase
public access to our state's archives, and this involved a
significant undertaking to digitize our archive materials to
make them easily viewable, not just to the people of
California, but to the world.
Question, first question is for Ms. Park. You noted that
prioritizing digitization is one of the Smithsonian's key
considerations with respect to AI. How do you envision
leveraging AI to increase public access to the Smithsonian?
Ms. Park. Indeed. I will maybe make a couple of comments in
response to your question. The first is that digitization is
absolutely one of our priorities as an institution. We have
been at it actually for a while. It is a behemoth task with
over 150 million objects, and we are working hard to identify
ways to prioritize that. We have a long ways to go in terms of
having those materials digitized.
When you refer to your own experience in California, the
first step, obviously, with AI is even getting the records
available and readable and analyzable in a digital format. So
that is job number one for us.
The second part, is we believe that, unlike a search engine
that would be able to help the public discover certain items
that we might have in our collection and learn about them, AI
has the ability for the public to make connections among the
documents and objects and items that we have in ways that we
cannot do as humans.
That we can use generative AI, and we hope to make it
available to the public as well, to be able to discover things
that we did not even realize we had in our collections. I think
there is some really exciting opportunities here, but as you
noted, job one is getting more of our items digitized and
readable in a way that AI can make use.
Senator Padilla. I will let you in on a secret, maybe a
good strategy. Whatever is most popular already, that is where
to start.
Ms. Park. The ruby slippers.
Senator Padilla. Because that tends to be the most popular
to everybody else. Just imagine the curating opportunities that
are possible when you get the metadata and the keywords right.
There are some good experts that will be helpful. Dr. Hayden,
same question to you.
]
Dr. Hayden. The Library has been really at the forefront in
the library field with looking at how digitized material could
be made more discoverable, because if it is not discoverable,
it is really not accessible.
One of the projects that I mentioned in my testimony was
taking a 20 year project of digitizing and making available
newspapers from all 50 states, but adding an AI instrument, a
navigator. You can now do even more research into those
newspapers. The photos that are in there, names, all types of
things.
We have seen that that has made what was just basically
making things, putting them into digital form from the vast
amount of analog material we have in print material going back
hundreds of years, just basically digitizing them. That is an
accessible aspect.
But having tools that have people be able to get into them
has proven very popular, especially when we allow the public to
use material in a creative way, like our Citizen DJ program,
where we put the material up there, music, all types of things,
and people can use them.
These tools can be very helpful for having people make
those connections between our various collections--we have
collections in 470 languages, and being able to use AI tools to
help----
Senator Padilla. A follow-up question to both of you. Do
you envision institution-wide or even specific initiatives to
always be contained within your respective institutions, or are
there opportunities for public-private partnerships that you
are envisioning at this point? Dr. Hayden and then Ms. Park.
Dr. Hayden. Well, the Library of Congress and the
Smithsonian are co-chairing a Secretariat in this coming year
that will look at more ways that we can all collaborate and, of
course, opportunities with the private sector when we are
making sure there are guardrails to them.
Senator Padilla. Correct.
Ms. Park. I would just add that absolutely, there are
opportunities to work with all sorts of external groups. Higher
education, companies, all are interested in this space.
We have formed several consortiums with different
organizations to try to figure out if we can convene together
to talk about these kinds of issues, to provide space for
people to discuss the complexities of AI. Absolutely, there are
ways for us to partner with others.
Senator Padilla. Okay. Thank you very much.
Chairwoman Klobuchar. Very good. Thank you. Senator
Hagerty.
Senator Hagerty. Thank you, Chair Klobuchar and Ranking
Member Fischer. I appreciate you holding this hearing. Dr.
Hayden, it is good to see you back here again--to all three of
our witnesses. Dr. Hayden, I would like to start with you,
though, if I might. We all know the Library of Congress houses
the United States Copyright Office.
Dr. Hayden. Yes.
Senator Hagerty. I think, as a result, you are in a unique
position to ensure the proper implementation of AI. I think, we
all know that AI offers many promising benefits, but with its
increasing prevalence, it is not without drawbacks.
]
I would like to take this home, and you and I have talked
about my affinity for the songwriting and music business in my
home State of Tennessee. We are actually home to thousands of
performing artists there in Tennessee, songwriters, artists,
all of whom have the potential to be greatly impacted by
artificial intelligence.
I am concerned that AI-generated deepfake recordings, voice
clones, or other infringements on the works of copyright
holders could cause serious damage to an artist's reputation
and to their livelihood.
Earlier this month, Governor Bill Lee announced plans for
legislation to protect the voices of performing artists by
adding their voices and sound to Tennessee's Protection of
Personal Rights law.
I am pleased that my home State of Tennessee is leading the
Nation in providing legal protection for our artists and for
our songwriters. My first question, Dr. Hayden, is given the
growing pervasiveness of AI, how does the Copyright Office plan
to protect the copyrighted works and uses of voices of
performing artist at the federal level?
Dr. Hayden. The Copyright Office has been in the forefront
of looking at the issues involved with machine generated works.
In fact, they have developed a separate web page for people who
are creators, giving guidance on that.
They have hosted a number of presentations and webinars,
and our Register of Copyrights, Shira Perlmutter, has been in
the last year in many, many international copyright sessions
and meetings. They just issued a rule to get information, and
they had over 10,000 responses.
They are going to be issuing more information about what
they are hearing from stakeholders about how that can really be
used, but also be protecting.
Senator Hagerty. Can I get into--let us drill into this a
little bit more in terms of information you are getting back
from stakeholders. In August, the Copyright Office issued a
notice of inquiry on copyright and artificial intelligence. The
notice sought information and comments on a number of issues,
including the use of copyrighted works to train AI models, the
appropriate levels of transparency and disclosure that are
required with respect to the use of copyrighted works, the
legal status of AI-generated outputs, and the appropriate
treatment of AI-generated outputs that mimic the personal
attributes of human artist.
I am sure that many Tennessee songwriters and artists
submitted information to the Copyright Office urging the
implementation of several things. One, the requirements for
obtaining appropriate licenses or authorization to ingest or
otherwise use materials that are copyrighted, or that implicate
a person's rights of publicity or privacy.
Second, requiring adequate recordkeeping and auditing.
Third, ensuring that appropriate transparency is maintained by
AI companies. Dr. Hayden, are these remedies that I just
listed, are those the types that the Copyright Office is
considering?
Dr. Hayden. Well, the office is currently reviewing those
comments, over 10,000, and they cover the full range. What they
are saying, and I have the information here, that they are
really look
]
ing at what could be infringement, the treatment of these types
of AI-generated outputs, and currently they are preparing that
report. I cannot comment further than that but they will----
Senator Hagerty. I hope they will take into account the
three points that I have raised that are certainly of interest
to our industry in Tennessee. Rights to the voices and
likenesses of performers are generally protected by state law
rather than copyright law.
That includes laws providing a right of publicity, privacy
protections, and remedies for misappropriation. Given this, in
your opinion, Dr. Hayden, are statutory changes needed to
adequately protect the name, the image, the likeness of
performing artists?
Dr. Hayden. Our Register of Copyrights, Shira Perlmutter,
is very involved with that. She will be working with Congress
on developing any potential legislation or any other things
that would impact the copyright law as it stands. Right now, it
is producing works by a human being. That is the standard.
Senator Hagerty. I certainly hope you will view my office
as a resource and the people of Tennessee as a resource here. I
think we can add significantly to the conversation. Thank you,
Dr. Hayden, and I yield back my time. Thank you.
Chairwoman Klobuchar. Very good. Thank you. Some of the
risks of AI are already clear. I talked about what just
happened with those robocalls and what we are seeing on--really
in fake videos on both sides of the aisle. It is not just one
side. I know the Republican Attorney General is investigating
what happened in New Hampshire.
But we know that there is going to be other security
issues, from our infrastructure, cyber-attacks. Could you talk
about what your agencies have done to guard against
cybersecurity threats to ensure that your systems remain strong
in the face of potential AI threats? Each one of you could
answer. Dr. Hayden.
Dr. Hayden. The Library of Congress, with the help of
Congress, has been able to build a very, very strong
cybersecurity foundation over a number of years.
In fact, our CIO, Judith Conklin, is a cybersecurity
expert. So that has been a major part of what we have been able
to bring to looking at the risks with this particular
technology, AI. It fits into our governance--IT governance
framework already, and we are making sure that we are not on
the cutting edge with AI.
We are looking at our policies using the experiences that
we have had. But there is a technology governance board within
the Library, and AI now has a working group within that board
to make sure that everything is aligned with that. We are very
concerned about the trustworthiness of products that have AI.
Chairwoman Klobuchar. Okay. Very good. Mr. Halpern.
Mr. Halpern. Absolutely. Our team works very hard to make
sure that our systems are as impregnable as possible. But we
are also looking at some AI tools as helpful in those efforts.
One of the things that AI excels at is pattern matching.
They may be able to see patterns in our logs that a human being
might not readily identify. So that is actually a benefit. One
of the other areas that is tangentially related is in the
privacy sphere, searching materials produced by others for
personally identifiable information.
]
Just like many, many other organizations, we have had
issues in the past where it has been hard for us to catch every
incidence of PII in our materials that we make public. But
again, these AI based tools that can recognize whether it is a
social security number or address or another piece of PII in
the Federal Register, the Congressional Record, or anything
else we publish, that is an additional layer of security that
these tools can help us with, so that we do not inadvertently
put something out in the public domain that is not supposed to
be there.
Chairwoman Klobuchar. Very good. Ms. Park.
Ms. Park. We take our cybersecurity responsibilities very
seriously, both in terms of our own internal practices, but
also in terms of our public domain. We do comply with NIST
standards when it comes to our cyber profile.
Our CIO is very much checking constantly to make sure that
we are following those standards. Our Inspector General is also
there to regularly check on our progress. The other thing we do
is we regularly report and, participate in federal forums where
you share information about the latest threats that might be
coming through various channels, including, the emergence of AI
and how it is being used.
For one, for example, phishing has become much more
sophisticated now with the emergence of AI and the ability to
create much more easily emails and other things that appear to
be real. There are--so we are stepping up our testing of our
own work force in their terms of their ability to recognize
these things. There is a lot of work going on there.
Finally, I would mention there is an internal group led by
our CIO right now that is really trying to develop or evolve
our policy structure to make sure that we are prepared for
whatever threats that might be coming from emerging
technologies, including AI.
Chairwoman Klobuchar. Are you all taking part in
cybersecurity training? Do you think that will be important as
we see this changing world, both opportunities and risks, with
your staff?
Dr. Hayden. Definitely----
Chairwoman Klobuchar. Is your staff doing--okay. Yes.
Mr. Halpern. Absolutely. We are evaluating vendors now for
some specific AI related training so that folks understand
these tools, and both the good and the bad that they can bring.
Ms. Park. We have an annual training requirement for all
staff who have access to our network.
Chairwoman Klobuchar. Okay. Dr. Hayden, Senator Hagerty
talked to you a bit about copyrights, voices. When you appeared
before the Committee last year, we discussed the Copyright
Office's new initiative to examine copyright law and policy
issues raised by AI. What are the lessons learned by the
Copyright Office over the past year? Have they continued to see
increases in the amount of copyright applications for AI-
generated content?
Dr. Hayden. Yes, they have. They have actually had a number
of cases. There have been, as I said, about 100 works that have
had AI-generated and human authorship, and they have been
registered by the office.
]
They are also taking a leadership role internationally when
looking at what is the proportion of the AI-generated content
and human, as well. They have definitely been on the forefront
of looking at that. But right now, they have rejected several
applications because of the amount of AI authorship.
Chairwoman Klobuchar. One last question of you, and then I
will have just one more. Your written testimony highlights the
work being done to test potential AI tools for the National
Library Service for the Blind and Print Disabled, including
improving the accessibility of book descriptions.
We have talked about this way back, some of the work we
have done with the blind. What guardrails has the Library put
in place to ensure the content being produced by these tools is
accurate for its users?
Dr. Hayden. That is part of the LC Labs, and working
directly with a service unit, NLS, National Library Service for
the Blind and Print Disabled. They have had quite a bit of
success with the e-reader rollout.
They are looking at how AI can be used to help this
population. There are some exciting opportunities, but they are
working hand in hand to make sure that what is being presented
to that community is trustworthy.
You can see that that is the main theme, I think for all of
us, that we want to use this tool for a number of reasons, for
efficiency, effectiveness, but also we have to make sure that
there is that oversight of use.
Chairwoman Klobuchar. Okay. Last, Ms. Park, you talked
about the assembling the group of experts from across the
Smithsonian to identify best practices, opportunities. Could
you talk about what next steps are after that, what the
timetable is?
Ms. Park. Yes. This group is charged with doing a number of
things. The governance piece is an important one, reviewing
policies, and also finding what is working within the units. We
have multiple museums and research institutes.
Figuring out where we can do some things to scale rather
than have individual units try to do their own thing where we
can, for efficiency sake. I have asked for them to do their
initial work and come back with some recommendations for what
we might need to do in the short term.
What are some of the immediate stopgaps that need to be put
in place, whether it is governance related or a best practice
related issue that we want to share. Then I suspect there will
be some longer term things that will be--take a little longer
to address, whether it is systems related, business process, or
applications. I expect it to be a bit of a phased approach.
Chairwoman Klobuchar. My last question is, since Judy
Garland's shoes came up, do you know where she was born, Judy
Garland?
Ms. Park. Oh, no, this is a quiz.
Chairwoman Klobuchar. Yes. Well, Grand Rapids, Minnesota.
Ms. Park. Yes, I was going to say--I was going to say
Minnesota.
Chairwoman Klobuchar. They just sort of solved the crime of
the missing shoes that were there, which I would just like to
note
]
for the record, finally. That they have been returned. It is a
sordid story. Yes, but they are back. They are back.
In any case, thank you very much. Do you want to ask any
other questions, Senator Fischer? We have a vote that has been
called and thank you for the work that you are doing,
continuing to do, leading your agencies.
I speak for myself, I know other Members of the Committee,
we feel good about your stewardship of these very important
agencies, and we look forward to working with you on the
important work you are doing.
As we discuss opportunities, risks, I am sure we will have
more discussions about this. The hearing record will remain
open for one week, and we are adjourned. Thank you.
