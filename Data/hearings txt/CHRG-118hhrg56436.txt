IMPORTING GLOBAL GOVERNANCE: EXAMINING THE DANGERS OF CEDING AUTHORITY OVER AMERICAN FINANCIAL REGULATION ---------- Thursday, March 21, 2024 U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Financial Services, Washington, D.C. The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:08 a.m., in room 2128, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Patrick McHenry  presiding. Members present: Representatives McHenry, Lucas, Sessions, Posey, Luetkemeyer, Huizenga, Wagner, Barr, Williams of Texas, Hill, Loudermilk, Mooney, Davidson, Rose, Steil, Norman, Meuser, Fitzgerald, Garbarino, Kim, Donalds, Flood, Lawler, Nunn, De La Cruz, Ogles; Waters, Sherman, Scott, Lynch, Green, Cleaver, Himes, Foster, Beatty, Vargas, Gottheimer, Gonzalez, Casten, Horsford, Tlaib, Torres, Garcia, Nickel, and Pettersen. Chairman McHenry. The Financial Services Committee will come to order. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a recess of the committee at any time. Today's hearing is entitled, ``Importing Global Governance: Examining the Dangers of Ceding Authority Over American Financial Regulation.'' I will now recognize myself for 4 minutes to give an opening statement. I want to thank our witnesses for being here. Today, we will examine the dangers of ceding authority of American financial regulation to global governance bodies. This hearing is a good governance exercise. Currently, there is little visibility into the dealings between our financial regulators and a complex network of international bureaucrats. This includes the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), and the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), just to name a few. That lack of transparency and accountability raises concerns about the extent to which other countries are influencing financial regulation here in the United States. In fact, as recently as 2017, Russian and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) banking officials have been scrubbing U.S. laws, regulations, and supervisory practices for compliance with Basel rules, sometimes physically on site here at U.S. agencies. That is absurd. To be clear, international cooperation can be positive and help set clear rules of the road for financial markets. However, when the scale repeatedly tips in favor of our competitors, we have a problem. The most glaring example of Federal banking agencies taking their cues from global governance bodies is the Basel III Endgame proposal. We have heard concerns from Members on both sides of the aisle about the impact of increased capital requirements on families, communities, and small businesses, but the proposal would also strengthen the competitiveness of foreign financial institutions at the expense of our own. Why would American banking regulators work to weaken our standing on the global stage? This is just the first of many questions we have for today's witnesses from the Federal Reserve (Fed), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). While you are not the ones setting policy for your respective agencies, you have insight into your organization's deliberations, negotiations, and discussions with these international forums. That is what we are seeking. I would also remind you that you have a responsibility to be transparent with Congress and the American people we represent as we work to fulfill our obligation of checks and balances in our system and as we work to fill in the blanks, the many blanks that are currently obvious to us on the Hill. Unfortunately, the lack of transparency by President Biden's banking regulators feels more like a feature than a bug. When Congress has zero visibility into the agency officials and staff participating in various workstreams in the global governance bodies, traditionally-independent regulators become a breeding ground for politics and partisanship. That is why today, we will consider a bill to create clear reporting requirements for American financial regulators dealing with global governance groups and provide insight into global deal-making. This bill brings financial regulators in line with other American officials, like those of the State Department and the U.S. Trade Representative that adhere to clear reporting structures regarding their involvement overseas. I will finish with this. President Biden's banking regulars are attempting to force progressive pet projects, all pushed by global governance bodies through our financial system. And for those who like those policies in the other party here on the committee, I would tell you, when the coin flips, I don't think you will like the results of an opaque process in international regulation. I don't think you will like this. So overall, I think this should be a good governance operation for us to get insight into how these regulators are making decisions. That is where I want to end. I will now recognize the ranking member of the committee, the gentlewoman from California, Ms. Waters, for 4 minutes. Ms. Waters. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Good morning. Last week, we marked the 1-year anniversary of the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, with First Republic failing soon thereafter. These features represented the second, third, and fourth largest bank failures in United States history and threatened to snowball into a full-blown banking crisis. Thankfully, the actions of President Biden, Secretary Yellen, and the banking regulators testifying today stabilized the situation, averting a banking crisis, and protected our nation's depositors. Because of their swift action, our banking system remains strong. Unfortunately, it seems as if Republicans and big banks are pretending like none of this ever happened. As our banking regulators move to write rules that would address weaknesses in our banking system, including on bank capital and related to the climate crisis, Republicans are convening this hearing to attack any effort to collaborate with other countries that face the same problems. Right now, the global climate crisis is getting even worse, as evidenced by the record-breaking heat, floods, storms, droughts, and wildfires that communities across the United States are experiencing. In the face of this crisis, we are seeing big banks and major financial institutions give into extreme MAGA Republicans and walk back many of the climate commitments they made to strengthen our banking system. Just last year, Bank of America walked back its commitment and began financing new coal mines, coal-burning power plants, and Arctic drilling projects. In addition, JPMorgan, State Street, PIMCO, and BlackRock all pulled out of an international coalition aimed at addressing climate issues. Let's be clear: Climate change is real, and climate-related-financial risk must not be ignored. It is critical that our financial institutions take these threats seriously instead of feeding into the extreme MAGA Republican's anti-ESG campaign. As if that wasn't bad enough, big banks are spending millions of dollars to gut the proposed Basel III Endgame rule to increase capital. Over the last several months, their executives have proven that they care more about protecting their million-dollar bonuses and further padding their pockets than they do about making Americans' banking stronger in the service of working families. Today, you will hear Republicans try to undermine our regulators as the regulators collaborate with their foreign counterparts to ensure that our global and interconnected financial system is strong. This adds to the long history Republicans have of abandoning our international partners and hurting our global standing in the process. Time and time again, Republicans shamelessly defend comments made by twice- impeached, 4-times-indicted, former President Trump, who attacks our partners in NATO and the U.N. Let's be clear: Extreme MAGA Republicans' hostility toward our allies is terrible for America and only weakens us as a nation. The US. banking system has the potential to be the strongest in the world, but we can't get there if our nation's most powerful banks and financial institutions block the government from devising policy that protects our nation's consumers. Rest assured, Committee Democrats are fighting back and working around the clock to strengthen the safety and soundness of the banking system, protect depositors, and prevent future financial crises. I don't know what more I can say. With that, I yield back the balance of my time. Chairman McHenry. The ranking member yields back. I will now recognize the Chair of our Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy, Mr. Barr, for 1 minute. Mr. Barr. Well, that was something. Today, we will discuss the interplay among financial regulators and a growing and tangled web of global governance bodies, such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Bank of International Settlements, and the Network for the Greening of the Financial System. The American people and their elected representatives know next to nothing about how U.S. regulatory agencies negotiate deals within these bodies. Those deals, we are told, are nonbinding, yet they become binding when U.S. regulators abide by them and respond to pressure from the global governance web to comply. Recently, we have seen global governance in action with reference to some framework agreements in the Basel III Endgame that no elected official negotiated or signed. This begs the question, who is in charge? We will seek answers, since it appears that unelected bureaucrats and global governance bodies have the abilities to bypass Congress, U.S. law, and even governing boards of Federal financial regulators to achieve their goals. Chairman McHenry. The gentleman's time has expired. The Chair now recognizes the ranking member of our Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy, Mr. Foster, for 1 minute. Mr. Foster. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to our witnesses. As the global economy changes, financial firms and their regulators must remain well-apprised of new and emerging risks. Geopolitical tensions, climate change, and emerging technologies like AI pose new challenges that will affect not only the economy of the United States, but economies from around the world. The BIS estimates there are nearly $38 trillion of cross-border claims among banks today, and there are regulatory lessons to be learned from the only global systemically important bank (G-SIB) failure since the Dodd- Frank Act, which was not in the U.S., but was Credit Suisse. Forums like the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) allow us to advance our national interests and leverage the influence of the United States in the development of international standards. The argument that our regulators, by participating in these international organizations, are somehow ceding their authority to the international community is misguided. U.S. regulators have no obligation to adopt the standards developed by these organizations, and any regulatory proposal informed by their participation must adhere to the same legal and procedural requirements as any other proposal by U.S. regulators. Chairman McHenry. The gentleman's time has expired. Mr. Foster. Thank you, and I yield back. Chairman McHenry. Today, we welcome the testimony of Dr. Michael Gibson, Director of Supervision and Regulation at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; Mr. Ryan Billingsley, Deputy Director of Capital Markets and Accounting Policy at the Division of Risk Management Supervision at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and Ms. Grovetta Gardineer, Senior Deputy Comptroller for Bank Supervision Policy at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. We thank each of you for being here. We will recognize you each for 5 minutes for an oral presentation of your testimony. And without objection, each of your written statements will be made a part of the record. And we will begin with you, Mr. Gibson. STATEMENT OF MICHAEL S. GIBSON, DIRECTOR, SUPERVISION AND REGULATION, BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (FED) Mr. Gibson. Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Waters, and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss the Federal Reserve Board's engagement with international organizations on supervisory and regulatory matters. The Board participates in various international forums in support of its statutory responsibilities of supervising and regulating financial institutions and fostering financial stability. In a globally-interconnected financial system, financial shocks can quickly propagate across national borders, and the Board seeks to promote the stability of the U.S. financial system by supporting strong and consistent minimum regulatory standards and sound supervisory practices for financial institutions globally. Engagement with international organizations also has been an effective and efficient means for understanding and sharing information on global financial risks, as well as an opportunity for the Board to help shape international standards and recommendations to the nature and needs of the U.S. financial system. It is also important to note that the standards and recommendations are not binding on any jurisdiction or member, including the United States and the Federal Reserve. Any changes to the regulations that apply to U.S. firms would be proposed by the Federal Reserve and go through our usual public notice-and-comment process. In support of its goal to enhance the strength, stability, and resilience of the financial system, the Board actively participates in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Financial Stability Board, and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS). The Board is also a member of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). Although the NGFS is not a standard-setting body, Board staff participate in its working groups to understand how other central banks are approaching climate-related financial risks. Each international group that we participate in has a unique organizational structure and purpose and holds regular meetings. The nature of the Board's participation varies accordingly by group. The Board promotes U.S. interests by participating in the main groups and subgroups and has leadership roles on major issues. As part of this work, we coordinate with other U.S. participants, such as the FDIC, the OCC, the SEC, Treasury, the Federal Insurance Office (FIO), and State Insurance Commissioners. These international groups are consensus-driven organizations. Participants seek to reach a common understanding around material issues and consider what policy choices could help to address those issues. Although it can be challenging to work through complex issues, this approach serves as a check on potentially undesirable policy recommendations. As with any other process, alternative viewpoints emerge and dissenting opinions are voiced. Before standards or recommendations are finalized, they are often subject to public consultation and the comments inform any final decisions. Staff from the Board engaged in these groups consult regularly with Board principles to ensure any final recommendations or standards align with the Board's policy goals. Once standards or recommendations are finalized, it is then up to individual members to implement any changes as appropriate in their respective jurisdictions. While the Board participates in these organizations, it is under no obligation to adopt any standards or recommendations that are developed. When the Board makes decisions about policy, it does so on the basis of its own domestic statutory mandates and responsibilities and in accordance with U.S. administrative law, importantly, including an opportunity for public comment on the proposal. The Board does not implement standards or recommendations that are beyond the scope of our mandate or are otherwise not appropriate for our banks and our financial system. The Board is committed to transparency in its own work and supports transparency by the international organizations in which it participates. These international organizations publish information to keep the public informed of their work. The Board supports efforts by international organizations to regularly publish information, including annual work plans and meeting summaries, and to subject work products, such as proposed international standards and supervisory principles, to public comment. Congressional oversight is an important feature of the U.S. regulatory framework. Congress has an oversight role for the Board's activities, including its participation in international organizations, and we welcome that oversight. Thank you, and I am happy to answer any questions you may have.  Chairman McHenry. Thank you. Mr. Billingsley, you are now recognized. STATEMENT OF RYAN BILLINGSLEY, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, CAPITAL MARKETS & ACCOUNTING POLICY, DIVISION OF RISK MANAGEMENT SUPERVISION, FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC) Mr. Billingsley. Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Waters, and members of the committee, I am pleased to appear at today's hearing to discuss the FDIC's engagement with international organizations. The FDIC's core mission is to maintain stability and public competence in the U.S. financial system. The FDIC carries out this mission through its responsibilities for deposit insurance, banking supervision, and the orderly resolution of failed banks. The FDIC's international engagement is guided by the same mission. My testimony today will discuss the FDIC's engagement with international organizations, including the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), and the International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI). The Financial Stability Board, or FSB, was established to improve international coordination and promote effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies. While the FDIC is not a member of the FSB plenary, the FDIC is a member of the Resolution Steering Group (ReSG). As a member of the ReSG, the FDIC has helped to develop international standards and guidance on the resolution of global systemically important financial institutions (G-SIFIs). Our contributions in this area have enabled the U.S. resolution regime to serve as a model for effective resolution regimes in other jurisdictions. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, or BCBS, is an international standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks and provides a forum for regular cooperation on banking supervisory matters. The FDIC engages the BCBS in support of its mission, and the BCBS aims to improve consistency of standards internationally. Through their work at the BCBS, the FDIC and the other Federal banking agencies have sought to strengthen the stability and resiliency of the banking sector, both domestically and abroad. The Network for Greening the Financial System, or NGFS, is a forum for collaboration and information-sharing among central banks and banking supervisors. Importantly, the NGFS is not a standard-setting body. The FDIC engages with members of NGFS to foster collaboration and share best practices in addressing climate-related financial risks. The International Association of Deposit Insurers, or IADI, is a forum for deposit insurers from around the world to gather and share knowledge and expertise. Its mission is to contribute to the enhancement of deposit insurance effectiveness by promoting guidance and international cooperation. As a member of IADI, the FDIC has supported the development of standards and best practices for depositor insurers around the world. The FDIC's work at IADI contributes to the stability of the global financial system by promoting international cooperation in the field of deposit insurance. To reiterate, the FDIC engages in international organizations in support of maintaining effective deposit insurance, bank supervision, and resolution systems. It is important to note that standards developed by these organizations do not have legal force. The implementation of any standard in the United States remains subject to the U.S. notice-and-comment rulemaking process, and the FDIC may elect to consider different standards that more appropriately reflect the specific characteristics of U.S. markets. I would like to close by saying that it is a privilege to work alongside so many talented people at the FDIC. They dedicate their careers to serving the public and the FDIC's mission, and I want to acknowledge and thank them all for all that they do. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.  Chairman McHenry. Ms. Gardineer, you are now recognized. STATEMENT OF GROVETTA N. GARDINEER, SENIOR DEPUTY COMPTROLLER FOR BANK SUPERVISION POLICY, OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC) Ms. Gardineer. Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Waters, and members of the committee, I am pleased to testify before the committee to discuss the OCC's engagements with the international forums to advance the agency's mission to ensure that national banks and Federal savings associations operate in a safe and sound manner, provide fair access to financial services, treat customers fairly, and comply with applicable laws and regulations. I oversee several of the agency's policy units, including those that participate in issues related to international banking. My written statement discusses the OCC's participation in international forums and the benefits this provides to the U.S. banking system. The OCC supervises several banks and U.S. affiliates of foreign banks that conduct business on a global scale. It is critical in our role as a prudential supervisor to understand the full scope that these global operations present so that we can assess the effectiveness of the bank's risk management policies and programs. Engaging with foreign counterparts is critical to achieving that understanding. International forums present an opportunity for regulators and supervisors to share knowledge and discuss common approaches, practices, and policies while fulfilling their individual supervisory mandates, and ultimately supporting the integrity of global financial markets. The OCC is a member of several international forums or their subgroups, including the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Financial Stability Board, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), and the Network for Greening the Financial System. The OCC's engagement in international forums is beneficial to the agency and the U.S. banking system. For example, our participation provides an opportunity to exercise U.S. leadership and promote U.S. policy interests by helping shape standards that may be adopted by jurisdictions around the world. Our participation helps establish a level playing field for global banking activities. This minimizes the possibility that another country's lax regulatory regime could give its banks a competitive cost advantage over U.S. banks or promote a race to the bottom by jurisdictions. Our membership also advances U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. For example, the OCC's participation in the FATF allows the agency to exert significant influence on the development, revision, and implementation of the FATF's Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework to strengthen regimes worldwide. This reduces the exposure of U.S. banks to money laundering and terrorist financing risks, thus preserving the integrity of the U.S. financial system and supporting the achievement of national security goals. In addition, OCC's engagement in international forums supports the development of more-consistent global frameworks, which makes it easier for internationally-active U.S. banks to understand what to expect in other operating environments. It also provides a venue for sharing supervisory and regulatory principles, practices, and perspectives. This can be especially helpful in educating members about developing issues and innovative topics, such as crypto assets, tokenization, generative artificial intelligence, and other developing technologies, particularly since these products and technologies do not recognize international borders. As a U.S. Federal regulator, the OCC maintains its independence. While international consistency is valuable, the OCC's priority is the safety, soundness, and fairness of the U.S. financial system. Any standards developed by the international forums in which the OCC participates inform OCC rulemakings, but are not otherwise applicable to federally- supervised banks without further action. In conclusion, the OCC participates in international forums to further U.S. interests, gain a better understanding of global developments in the financial industry to move the international regulatory framework toward more consistently high and appropriate standards, and strengthen our relationships with foreign counterparts. Thank you, and I look forward to answering your questions.  Chairman McHenry. Thank you all for your testimony. I will now recognize myself for 5 minutes for questions. I will begin with you, Mr. Gibson, on behalf of the Federal Reserve. The Basel Committee's charter requires a public consultation process for all Basel standards. Yet, in May 2022, the Basel Committee, without public consultation, altered the G-SIB surcharge for the largest banks, but specifically for European Union banks. The net result was for European G-SIBs, European large banks, there was a 50-basis-point reduction in their capital surcharge. Are you aware of this? Mr. Gibson. Yes. Chairman McHenry. Okay. At the time, there were several critics of the secretive change to the G-SIB framework, including the progressive group, Better Markets, who described the Basel Committee as shamefully lowering capital requirements for European banks without public input. Does the Federal Reserve believe that there is public input in that process? Mr. Gibson. You are asking if the Basel Committee put that change out for public comment? I don't know. I don't remember. Chairman McHenry. You don't remember? Okay. Mr. Gibson. On that particular change, I can check and get back to you. Chairman McHenry. So, there is a most significant change in capital surcharges until the next set of negotiations at the Basel Committee, which resulted in much higher capital surcharges for U.S. banks, which is now going through the Federal Reserve process and all of the regulators for this additional Michael Barr approach to new capital standards. How does the Federal Reserve reconcile relaxing European large bank capital surcharges, and yet, in the next negotiation, increasing U.S. capital surcharges on our U.S. domestic banks? Mr. Gibson. With respect to the G-SIB surcharge, it was one of the post-2008 financial crisis---- Chairman McHenry. No, no, this was 2022, a decade after the financial crisis. Let's not misstate this. That is what I am asking you about, 2022, and then, last year. Mr. Gibson. In the U.S., we, the Federal Reserve, have proposed some modifications to the G-SIB surcharge. Chairman McHenry. I am aware of that. I am asking you about the Basel Committee and the name of this committee hearing on the international coordination. The justification from the Vice Chair of the Fed was that we have to implement the Basel standards. That is the justification, so that is why I am asking about this international coordination. Mr. Gibson. We do coordinate at the Basel Committee on common approaches to things like the G-SIB surcharge, but we implement them domestically according to our rulemaking process. Chairman McHenry. Okay. I understand that, but you then negotiate those standards internationally and have agreement internationally. That is what the Basel Committee does. Is that correct? Mr. Gibson. Yes. Chairman McHenry. This is what I am trying to highlight for Members here. Who attends these Basel Committee meetings on behalf of the Federal Reserve? Do you have a designated staff? Mr. Gibson. I attend the Basel Committee meetings, and Chair Powell and Vice Chair Barr attend the oversight body of governors and heads of supervision. Chairman McHenry. Was there a vote on this question of the European Union G-SIB surcharge, the reduction in capital standards? Was there a vote at the Basel Committee on that? Mr. Gibson. The decisions aren't voted on; they are by consensus. Chairman McHenry. By consensus. So, you put out reports, but we don't know relative opinions, the Federal Reserve's view, the FDIC's view, the OCC's view; what we get is just the result in these disclosures? I am asking what U.S. nationals are doing on behalf of implementing financial policy and the opinions going in and the results coming out, which we don't have disclosures on. Mr. Gibson. In the example that you are citing of the discussions in the Basel Committee around the changes to the G- SIB surcharge, the way we would handle that is that I would brief Vice Chair Barr about what the discussions are at the Basel Committee. And nothing that is done in the Basel Committee is binding on us, but we do want to give good input and we would give our input into those discussions. Chairman McHenry. Okay. This is the basic question for all regulators. We send the U.S. Trade Representative out internationally. We know who is negotiating for us. There are disclosures back to Congress on implementing trade laws. We have financial regulators that are implementing stuff that is even more impactful than trade negotiations, that have a direct bearing on domestic lending to small businesses and families and mortgages, and yet, we have no disclosures on it, we have no equivalent disclosures on it. That is the driving question here, and that is the reason why we are having this hearing. This is what I want to highlight. This one example with the Fed lowering European bank capital standards, and in the same breath, in the same committee internationally, raising U.S. capital standards in the next set of meetings. And yet, we have no justification for this, nor the relative opinion of the Federal Reserve. With that, I will now recognize the ranking member, Ms. Waters, for 5 minutes. Ms. Waters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Gibson, the Fed participates as a member of the Basel Committee, and that organization came to an agreement in 2017 with respect to the Basel III Endgame proposal to strengthen bank capital requirements. And while Republicans like to bash international agreements, even former Secretary Steven Mnuchin applauded the 2017 agreement, saying, ``The reforms would standardize the approach to capital regulation, improve the quality and consistency of bank capital requirements, and level the playing field for U.S. banks.'' Recently, Treasury Secretary Yellen highlighted the importance of getting these rules implemented when she testified on FSOC's annual report. Unfortunately, it took our regulators more than 6 years to issue a proposal to implement the 2017 Endgame reforms, which the Fed and other banking regulators finally did last year. That is because Trump's other appointees decided to prioritize deregulating regional banks, including allowing large banks like SVB to opt out of capital requirements related to their securities portfolio that had large unrealized losses. Dr. Gibson, can you confirm that in the Fed's report on the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, you found that the bank appeared better capitalized by nearly 2 percent because of this opt-out for Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI)? Mr. Gibson. We only apply that AOCI passthrough to the largest banks, and it was not applied to Silicon Valley Bank. That is correct. Ms. Waters. Thank you. Would you confirm that the Basel III Endgame rule will fix this loophole and ensure that other large banks are being capitalized? Mr. Gibson. That was what the agencies proposed last year. It is out for comment, and we received comments on that provision, so we are reviewing the comments. Ms. Waters. Thank you. I know your agencies are getting a lot of pushback from the banks and are looking at making changes, but this rule is absolutely critical to preventing a future failure and protecting consumers across the country, so I urge your agencies to finalize the rule this year. Ms. Gardineer, I appreciate you sharing OCC's work on international bodies where you can collaborate and learn from what other countries are doing. However, it seems like the United States is behind the curve in addressing climate-related risks compared to other countries. For example, regulators in the United Kingdom included climate change in their insurance and stress testing 4 years ago, and the Bank of England designed their 2021 stress test to aid their economy's transition to net zero and to analyze climate-related risk on capital requirements. What is your agency learning from foreign regulators that you seek to update requirements to ensure our banks are absolutely and adequately considering and addressing climate-related financial risks? Ms. Gardineer. Thank you for the question, Ranking Member Waters. In our engagement with the NGFS as well as the Basel Committee, we are learning and sharing knowledge about what their experience has been in implementing their rules and their engagement. What we have done here at the OCC is, starting in 2022, the OCC began reviewing information on our largest institutions by doing a range of practice reviews based on some of the things that we have learned from our international engagement. While we are doing that, we also acknowledge that many of the largest banks--and that has been the focus of our engagement and our work--have started to do climate-related financial risk activities of their own initiative. So understanding what the experience has been on an international basis helps us to frame our approach going forward. Ms. Waters. Thank you. What is your agency learning from foreign regulators as you seek to update requirements to ensure our banks are adequately considering and addressing climate- related financial risk? Ms. Gardineer. We are looking at and learning about how they are doing their risk management, what they are doing with regard to transition risks, what they are doing with regard to physical risks. Those issues actually are very important to our risk management approach as we consider how we will implement that here at the OCC. Ms. Waters. Thank you very much, and I yield back the balance of my time. Chairman McHenry. The gentleman from Arkansas, the Vice Chair of the committee, Mr. Hill, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Hill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thanks to our panel for being with us today. Thanks for your contributions to this discussion, because it is so important that when we think about American leadership, we think about that across-the-board, including in harmonizing regulations around the world. But this is a tough time, I think, in the U.S., because we have a group of people in our country who think that Europe has all the solutions to so many issues, whether we are talking about privacy on GDPR, investment research or investment standards, artificial intelligence, and, of course, a topic today, the Basel III standards on setting global capital standards. During my time at the Treasury and as a White House official, it was the real mission of our regulatory agencies and our policy leaders to be sure that our government would defend our ability to have the regulatory system that we want, that we think is proper for our companies in a Federal republic for competitiveness purposes. Sure, we are going to go to these meetings, and we are going to listen to all of this stuff, and we are big picture for harmonization, but we are really big picture for America's competitive position. And we wouldn't agree to anything, even if it was harmonious, that we thought would put us in an anticompetitive position for our capital markets, for our financial conditions here. But I don't see that consistently as a policy position in the Biden Administration at all, and U.S. financial regulation seems to be, as I say, being subsumed by European ideas, which I don't think are in the right direction. Last week, the SEC published their climate disclosure rule for public companies, and that is the most recent example of a bad idea inboarded from across the Atlantic. In today's hearing, you are going to hear us talk about pervasive ways that this is shaping regulations here at home, including this incorporation of climate activism into our Federal prudential supervisory framework. Following up on Chairman McHenry's line of questioning, let's talk about theBasel Endgame. The U.S. clearly has a higher surcharge for G-SIB banks than those in Europe. Our stress capital buffer is based on supervisory stress tests, among other things, which are all more strict than in Europe. Would you agree with that, Dr. Gibson? Mr. Gibson. On both of those matters? Yes, I would agree. Mr. Hill. It seems to me when I look at the 800-plus-page proposal from Basel III, and that is why I think there were so many negative comments that we already have a strict Basel III level or above-capital standard, and it exceeds that in Europe. And I think a lot of people feel like some of this is redundant. The ranking member talked about Steve Mnuchin, our former Treasury Secretary, talking about his hope--his statement was a hope that the reform would standardize the approach, and improve the quality and consistency of bank capital, and that that would help level the playing field for U.S. banks. I find it to be just the opposite. How many people wrote to you in support of Basel III in the rulemaking, Dr. Gibson? What percentage of the comments were positive? Mr. Gibson. Most of the comments were negative, not positive. Mr. Hill. And were some of those comments about level playing field U.S. banks for the big banks? Mr. Gibson. We got comments about that. Mr. Hill. Yes, and I bet a lot of them felt like, God, this is making it worse, not better. Would that be generally true based on what you read from the comments? Mr. Gibson. We got comments in both directions, but most of the comments were negative. Mr. Hill. Yes. I think it doubled down on gold-plating and puts the U.S. absolutely at a disadvantage with international banks at the top, and it is inconsistent, including with what is going on in the U.K., Japan, and Canada. Let me ask you this: Did you participate in writing the memorandum that we received last May about the look back at the Silicon Valley Bank supervisory process? Mr. Gibson. We had staff who---- Mr. Hill. But you reviewed it, did you not? Mr. Gibson. Yes. Mr. Hill. Because that is an important document, and Vice Chair Barr was great at being so responsive to the committee. In your view, what was the top issue, the two mistakes that Silicon Valley Bank made? Mr. Gibson. They didn't manage their interest rate risk or liquidity risk well. Mr. Hill. Right, and neither one of those is dependent on capital. I think the issue here is that supervisors failed, their management failed, and customers were not attentive, and to try to connect Silicon Valley Bank to whether we should or should not adopt Basel III Endgame is a false canard. I yield back. Chairman McHenry. The gentleman from California, Mr. Sherman, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Sherman. It seems odd that those who oppose this improvement in our regulations are listing xenophobia, when in fact, what you folks are doing goes far beyond the European standards, as the gentleman from Arkansas pointed out. I don't know whether the standards you are adopting are too high, but I do know that if they are, we shouldn't be blaming the Europeans, because their standards are not too high. We are told that we should ignore climate, but I don't see anybody on this committee investing in the sovereign debt of the Maldives--it is predicted that the Maldives will be an entirely submerged nation by the end of this century. I won't even ask the question of our bank regulators here, but I would think that if all of a bank's assets were divested in the Maldives, you would notice that subaquatic countries usually can't pay their debt. What concerns me here is that we are going to make some mistakes in how we adopt these regulations, and I don't think we should blame the Europeans for that. The first of these is, it is my understanding that these proposed regulations give no weight to private mortgage insurance (PMI). Is that true, and are you going to fix it? I will ask our first witness. Mr. Gibson. We have gotten comments on the issue of mortgages, generally, and private mortgage insurance, in particular. The proposal doesn't change the treatment of private mortgage insurance. It is recognized in a particular way in the current capital rules, and that is not proposed to change in the proposed rules. We have gotten a lot of comments on that. Mr. Sherman. You are not changing risk weights on loan-to- value ratios that ignore the effect of private mortgage insurance? Mr. Gibson. The proposal would change the risk weights to make them risk-sensitive. Mr. Sherman. And changing those risk weights, you would have the same rate for mortgages or the same loan-to-value ratio whether there was mortgage insurance or there wasn't mortgage insurance. Is that correct? Mr. Gibson. Not necessarily. Mr. Sherman. That is what everybody in the industry is saying. Do any of our witnesses want to assure me that private mortgage insurance is going to be reflected in the risk the bank has taken? Mr. Billingsley. Certainly, we can't make that assurance, but like Mike said, I think that is an area where we get a lot of comment from the industry for sure. Mr. Sherman. Okay. Now, under the proposed rules you are doing, you are appropriately treating tax credits owned by banks for low-income housing, but you are treating much worse tax credits for clean energy. Is that something that I can count on you to clean up? I will ask the witness at the far end. Ms. Gardineer. Congressman Sherman, I think we have gotten a lot of comments about that, and we are thoroughly reviewing those comments and the process is moving forward. And we will address those in any final product that we issue. Mr. Sherman. Okay. Now, in a capitalist society, the allocation of capital is critical, and it is often a fight between Wall Street and my local pizzeria, my local Main Street business. And throughout this process, you have tilted things toward Wall Street and against Main Street. First, you have a rule of only 65 percent waiting for a company that happens to be publicly traded, whereas a company of equivalent risk is 100 percent. Second, you do not mark to market long-term bonds held if the bank just says that they are going to hold them to maturity. Finally, on that 65-percent rule, not only do you hit small and medium-sized businesses, but also mutual funds and pension plans. Can I be assured that when these rules actually come out, that small businesses, mutual funds, and pension plans will not be discriminated against as compared to publicly-traded corporations? Mr. Billingsley? Mr. Billingsley. Again, I can't provide you the assurance you are asking for, but the issue you raised about the corporate risk weight is a really important one. Mr. Sherman. I want to get in one more thing. You guys are obviously getting a lot of input, including in this room. Can I be assured that you are getting more input from Americans than Europeans in writing these rules? I will ask each witness. More from Europeans or more from Americans in terms of total input? Mr. Gibson. More of the comments are from Americans. Mr. Sherman. And more of the committee hearings---- Mr. Gibson. Likewise. Mr. Sherman. ----and meetings. Is that correct? And I will ask our third regulator. Ms. Gardineer. Yes. Mr. Sherman. Okay. So if you guys screw it up, don't blame the Europeans, and if you oppose these rules, don't enlist as xenophobia. I yield back. Chairman McHenry. The gentleman's time has expired. The gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Lucas, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Lucas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is the primary global standard-setter for prudential regulation of banks, and of course, the Fed, the FDIC, and the OCC are all members. And as we have heard today, there is significant concern about the lack of transparency in the Basel Committee's internal proceedings, which your agencies are party to. Director Gibson, are you aware if the Basel Committee deliberations regarding capital standards are public in any way or if any of the proceedings are even public-facing? Mr. Gibson. Yes. The Basel Committee puts out those standards for public comment and takes account of the comments when they finalize the standards. Mr. Lucas. But are the deliberations public, like the minutes from other Federal agencies? Mr. Gibson. They publish summaries of the meetings and they publish their documents. Mr. Lucas. Do we know that decisions by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision are taken by consensus among the members? Director Gibson, why not just have each jurisdiction vote and have majority rule? Could you articulate about why consensus building is important? Mr. Gibson. The Basel Committee operates by consensus because nothing it does is binding on any country. So if countries are going to agree to something in the Basel Committee, they still have to implement it through their domestic process and with their domestic statutory responsibilities. The consensus at the Basel Committee helps make sure that things that countries are discussing in Basel are going to be consistent with our domestic statutory mandates. Mr. Lucas. So, consensus is key. Is using this model the only way to promote a lasting and resilient capital framework? Mr. Gibson. In the Basel Committee, there are no binding agreements possible, so there are no votes, and there is really no other way the Basel Committee can have those discussions other than operating by consensus. It is different from legally-founded organizations. Mr. Lucas. Maybe the Fed should use the same kind of system. That said, thinking about my colleague, Mr. Hill's, observations, you are all aware of the significant concern that the Basel Endgame proposal from your agencies will disadvantage U.S. banks on multiple fronts. There has been much discussion about that here. The proposal goes far beyond the capital requirements that banks and other jurisdictions are subject to, like the EU. Director Gibson, when revisiting capital standards, to what extent does the Fed consider the implication of Basel standards by our international counterparts, the nature of the playing field? Mr. Gibson. We definitely look at the competitive landscape. Yes, we look at that. Mr. Lucas. Okay. The charter for the Basel Committee requires that each member commit to implementing the committee's decisions. From my understanding, the Basel Committee assesses the timeliness and the completeness of domestic regulations. However, of course, in the United States, we have a process that, in theory, should inform the making of rules. Director Gibson, focusing on Basel III Endgame proposal, I am concerned that there could be an unwillingness by the Fed to deviate too far from the Basel capital standards, given the Fed is already committed to implementation. So, how much weight does the Fed give to these past commitments as a member of the Basel Committee during the Fed's rulemaking process? Mr. Gibson. The Fed's rulemaking process is going to be focused on what is the best rule to implement our domestic statutory mandate. Mr. Lucas. As long as it is not contrary to the commitments we have given to the other entities. Okay. I will note that in Europe, implementation of the Basel Committee standards is done through the legislative process, through their parliament. In the United States, the Basel standards are solely left up to banking regulators. That makes the revision period after comment intake even more important, and it is the sole opportunity for the public to be heard. One last thought: The Basel Committee comprises 45 members consisting of central bank regulators from 20 jurisdictions, including your agencies, and the central banks of Japan, Indonesia, Mexico, and around the world. Director Gibson, in the internal Basel meetings, does equal weight apply to each member? Whether you are a big economy or a small economy, does equal weight apply to each member's consensus-building process? Mr. Gibson. It is a consensus-driven organization, but certainly the U.S. has a big role, because we are the world's largest economy. Mr. Lucas. Ironically, Mr. Chairman, only a handful of countries have significant banks. With that, I yield back. Mr. Hill. . The gentleman yields back. The gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Scott, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Scott. Thank you, Chairman Hill. Director Gibson, here is the situation as I understand it. Under Basel, different jurisdictions are given national discretion to increase or decrease certain components of the regulatory framework based upon their own needs. Is that correct? Mr. Gibson. Yes, that is correct. Mr. Scott. The significant increase in U.S. capital requirements related to banks' trading activities has so far differed from the approach taken elsewhere around the world, is that correct? Let me get to the example here. The United Kingdom and Europe reforms are expected to result in roughly 3- percent and 10-percent increases in aggregate capital levels across their banking sectors. Is that correct? Mr. Gibson. That sounds about right. Mr. Scott. Okay. This is compared, however, to a nearly 30- percent increase in capital levels for the largest U.S. banks when including both the Basel Endgame proposal and the surcharge changes. Is that correct? Mr. Gibson. The first numbers you quoted were for all banks. Mr. Scott. Yes. Mr. Gibson. And now, you are quoting a different number. Mr. Scott. Yes, because my question is this: Why is there such a discrepancy between the European regulators and us here in the United States, our regulators, when the entire goal was to harmonize requirements? Mr. Gibson. Those comparisons are definitely one of the areas where we have gottens comments on our rulemaking, so we are going to look at that through the comment process, certainly. Mr. Scott. And what is the path forward for this proposal in relation to capital rules, and also, what changes are you considering in response to the number of comments submitted by businesses and consumers who have raised concerns? Mr. Gibson. We have gotten over 300 comments and we are reviewing all of them, and we will take all of those into account when we move forward with the final rule. Mr. Scott. Are you pretty much satisfied with what is going on here? Do you agree with the status of the situation as it is? Do you see any dangers? Because this is a pretty large differentiation between the results and activities and directions that the European Union is going in and what we are going in. But we are all connected, and there is great interplay between both our situation here in the United States and Europe, but there is this huge differentiation. Mr. Gibson. The Board will be making decisions going forward about capital based on what is good for achieving our domestic statutory mandates for a strong banking system and a strong economy. Mr. Scott. Now, let me ask you this about your path forward. For the proposal in relationship to capital rules, what changes are you considering in response to the number of comments submitted by businesses who have raised these concerns? Mr. Gibson. We are considering all of the comments that were received. We are looking at all of them and analyzing them. Mr. Scott. Okay. That is fine. Thank you very much. Mr. Hill. The gentleman from Georgia yields back. The gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Luetkemeyer, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank the witnesses for being here this morning. It is kind of an interesting discussion. Let me start by saying that the various global governance bodies, like the Basel Committee and the Network for Greening the Financial System, frequently engage in what they call stocktakes. This is where a global governance body looks at what is recommended and scans the world to see who is doing what the global governance body wants and who is not. Part of the stocktaking involves surveying and monitoring, sometimes physically on site at the FDIC or the Fed by global peers. As recently as 2017, Chinese and Russian supervisory and regulatory officials participated in reviewing U.S. laws, rules, and regulatory framework, sometimes here in the United States, to determine whether we were adhering to the so-called recommendations. This cannot happen. We have the strongest and most-liquid capital markets in the world. We have the strongest and most-dynamic banking system, which is the envy of the world. Why in the world do we want to open up our regulatory framework to be manipulated by nonbinding recommendations from hostile foreign governments? Deputy Director Billingsley, has the BCBS or NGFS, or both, sent any questionnaires or monitors over to the FDIC over the past 5 years asking and probing the FDIC for adherence of the U.S. regulatory framework to the recommendations of the global governance body? Mr. Billingsley. Yes. The peer reviews you are asking about, we have definitely engaged in over the years, but I would note that the results of those things have no effect, no force. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Why in the world are you letting them in? That is the question. What good could come out of that? Mr. Billingsley. The answer to that question is that I think we learn a lot from engaging and understanding how jurisdictions' rules differ. Mr. Luetkemeyer. We are learning something from the Communist Chinese Party of China or the Russian banks? Are you kidding me? Mr. Billingsley. No, our involvement in the process more generally, is not specific to, I suppose, the question you are asking. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Those two banks are the ones that came over. I just told you that. Are you learning anything from them? Mr. Billingsley. Not during the process you are talking about, no, but from our involvement more broadly and being able to look at other jurisdictions. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Why are they even allowed to come in? Mr. Billingsley. At that time, they were both members of the Basel Committee. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Mr. Gibson, same question. Why in the world did you let the Russians and the Chinese come in our country and look at our stuff and expect them to be able to be good guys about this? Mr. Gibson. These reviews look at our laws and they look at our regulations, which are all public information. We share public bank data. And if we were to share any confidential data, we would anonymize it, so it wouldn't be identified to any bank. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Why even take the risk of allowing them in here if you say it is public information that they are looking at? Mr. Gibson. We meet with the team that wants to look at our regulations. Mr. Luetkemeyer. What are you learning from them? Anything? Mr. Gibson. All Basel Committee members, we share information about---- Mr. Luetkemeyer. You know exactly what I am talking about. I am talking about the Russians and the Chinese. What are you learning from them, because you are allowing them in? Mr. Gibson. If they are reviewing our rules, then we are not learning. We are explaining how we have implemented things domestically. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Okay. Have you performed a similar oversight like that on any other countries in the world? Mr. Gibson. The Basel Committee does reviews of---- Mr. Luetkemeyer. No, I am just asking, the United States Federal Reserve, the OCC, are you conducting those same kind of reviews anywhere else in the world, like the Chinese and Russians were doing to us? Mr. Gibson. We have sent staff to join some of these review teams in the past, yes. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Do you ever bring our rules and regulations to the Basel Committees? Instead of bringing their stuff here, do you ever take our stuff there? Mr. Gibson. We do share what we do---- Mr. Luetkemeyer. Do they ever implement our stuff? Mr. Gibson. Sometimes. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Give me an example. Mr. Gibson. We recently proposed a change to our G-SIB surcharge formula to average the data over the year instead of having it be only measured at the end of the year. That is a proposal that was out for comment, and the Basel Committee is now proposing the same thing subsequently. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Ms. Gardineer, you made a comment a while ago about things that you have learned from these folks. What has the OCC learned from Russia or China? Ms. Gardineer. Congressman Luetkemeyer, the OCC takes the national security of the United States very serious, and we---- Mr. Luetkemeyer. Oh, that is enough. I am done. I don't need platitudes. Here is another question for you: With regards to implementing these rules and regulations, I have had three foreign banks from Europe in my office in the last 2 weeks, and they laughed at me when I asked the question about Basel, because I said, what are you doing? Are you implementing these things? They said, no, we are not doing it because it makes us noncompetitive. Mr. Hill. The witness can answer that question in writing. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Thank you very much. I yield back. Mr. Hill. The gentleman's time has expired. I thank the gentleman from Missouri. The gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. Lynch, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Lynch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Gardineer, just following up on that last line of questioning, through the FATF recommendations, we have the ability to project our anti-money laundering and terrorist financing standards on other countries. Is that right? Ms. Gardineer. That is correct, sir. Mr. Lynch. Yes. So if they don't comply with anti-money laundering regimes that we have established, and anti-terrorist financing standards that we have projected on other countries, they can't operate through our financial institutions. Is that correct? Ms. Gardineer. Yes. We have opportunities to stop that type of transaction. Mr. Lynch. Yes. I think there are 190 countries that are involved or are a signatory to FATF, so we make sure that those other countries, in order to do banking business with us, cannot have lower standards that would allow money laundering or allow terrorist financing? Is that correct? Ms. Gardineer. Yes. Our engagement with the FATF allows us to have higher and more appropriate standards to guard against the race to the bottom or to introduce that type of risk to the United States. Mr. Lynch. Right. And in most countries, through their banking system, they want to have a stamp of legitimacy, right? In order to attract capital, they want to show people that they are operating under standards that have integrity and that those depositors and businesses can rely upon. Is that correct? Ms. Gardineer. Yes. It does allow the other countries to understand and have a sense of confidence in a strong regime from other jurisdictions. Mr. Lynch. And there are penalties. I know that FATF on occasion will look, will instruct certain countries to get into line to raise their standards if they feel that the money laundering risk or the tendency of terrorist financing to occur in that country is out of compliance with international standards. Is that correct? Ms. Gardineer. Yes. They actually publish and make it quite public if there is a weakened standard in a jurisdiction. Mr. Lynch. Okay. Thank you. I want to jump over to something else. The Financial Stability Board has recently reported that for shadow banking--these are financial companies that operate in quasi-banking businesses, but they are not regulated like banks--the financial assets held by those shadow banking institutions now stands at about $460 trillion, which is almost about half of all financial assets that are in existence around the globe. I know that the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is examining the vulnerabilities in that shadow banking world, and this is a question for all three of you. Could you offer your thoughts on what we have learned from our collaboration with international financial regulatory organizations to ensure that this shadow banking system is not creating a regulatory blind spot and a latent risk to our traditional banking system? Ms. Gardineer. I am happy to start. The nonbank financial institutions, I think, do pose similar risks to the United States and other countries around the globe. It is important for us to share our experiences in order to manage that risk and make sure that the risks do not trickle into the United States' financial system. So I think sharing those experiences, looking at that acceleration of growth allows us to have some harmonization around how we treat these entities. Mr. Lynch. Right. Mr. Gibson, would you like to add to that? Mr. Gibson. Just to say that the Financial Stability Board has been focusing on that topic, and by producing the report that you cited, they have increased the transparency around the nonbank financial intermediation significantly. Mr. Lynch. Thank you. Mr. Billingsley? Mr. Billingsley. I would just add that through the international coordination, we can learn more about how banks are connected to the nonbank finance system you mentioned and understand how we could get feedback from the banking system. Mr. Lynch. Okay. My time has just about expired, Mr. Chairman, so I will yield back. Mr. Barr. . The gentleman yields back. The gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Huizenga, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Huizenga. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity. I am going to jump right into this, since I have a few topics that I would like to cover. Given the recent finalized rule by the SEC over the climate-related disclosures, I thought perhaps we could explore how decision-making internally has influenced decisions being made by American regulators. On November 29, 2023, the Basel Committee issued a paper on what they call a Pillar 3 disclosure framework for climate- related financial risks as part of its, ``holistic approach to address climate-related financial risks to the global banking system.'' The Basel Committee said its work was to, ``further its mandate to strengthen the regulation, supervision, and practices of banks worldwide with the purpose of enhancing financial stability and the potential design of such a climate framework.'' It sounds like awesome work, but in that paper, the Basel Committee said it was exploring disclosure requirements that included bank deposits and risks posed to banks if depositors and others, ``are impacted by climate- related financial risks and may require drawdown of their deposits.'' So, Deputy Director Billingsley, does the FDIC agree with the Basel Committee that it is important to consider imaginary climate-related bank runs as a possible source of financial instability? And if so, what is the reason and evidence for why we will see bank runs being caused by climate change? Mr. Billingsley. At the FDIC, we are really focused on the financial risks associated with climate change, so we are really focused on how climate-related financial risk could feed into the traditional banking risk. Mr. Huizenga. Okay. So That is my question. What is the reason and the evidence of why we would see bank runs being caused by climate change? Mr. Billingsley. The disclosure requirements you just cited, I don't think necessarily get into the details of that, but I think it is important to note that the disclosures you are talking about, we got a lot of comments back on those. I think the comment period for the Basel Committee ended last week or the week before last, so I am expecting to have some good---- Mr. Huizenga. So, you need to review the comments before you are able to answer that? Mr. Billingsley. No. I just think the comments we received, particularly from U.S.-based entities, will be helpful. Mr. Huizenga. You must not leave your microphone on, but why aren't you able to then answer my question? Mr. Billingsley. I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question? Mr. Huizenga. For the third time, what reason and evidence is there that you believe that there will be bank runs related to climate change? You gave me gobbledygook first. Then you told me, well, we are getting a bunch of comments and that will be helpful. I asked whether you could answer my question or not, and you asked me to repeat the question. Mr. Billingsley. I am not aware of a bank run---- Mr. Huizenga. Imagined scenario. Mr. Billingsley. I am not aware of a bank run at this time, to be honest. Mr. Huizenga. Okay. Well, it took three attempts, but thank you. In a Fed research paper authored by an official who serves as Co-Chair of the Basel Committee's Task Force on Climate- related Financial Risks, an idea called, ``double materiality,'' was analyzed. The idea seems to be that bank supervisory authorities should consider both the risks that banks face from climate change themselves and any impacts of bank actions, such as to whom and where they lend on climate change. For example, if a perfectly legal and financially- healthy producer of a product that the Fed might think is a so- called, ``brown sector,'' got a loan from a bank, maybe the Fed would want the bank to view the loan as riskier because the Fed thinks that they are creating products that could potentially cause more wildfires or harsh storms or things like that in the future. Is that something with which the FDIC also agrees? Mr. Billingsley. No. The issue you raise about double materiality is not within our mandate. Mr. Huizenga. Okay. Director Gibson, under the guise of safety and soundness, what would prevent the Fed in the future from using existing authorities to change bank supervision using concepts such as double materiality to channel credit away from what future Fed officials and the global governance crowd believe are brown sectors and toward what they believe to be green sectors? Mr. Gibson. Our supervisory focus is only around safety and soundness. It is not around favoring one sector over another. Mr. Huizenga. That is not what your researchers are talking about. Mr. Gibson. Research papers are not the official position of the Federal Reserve. Our researchers publish their research, but that is not an official position. Mr. Huizenga. Okay. The Federal Reserve's Vice Chair for Supervision led a review of the Federal Reserve's supervision and regulation of SVB and published the results along with his personal cover letter that included, in my view, some biased and unnecessarily-politicized views that are not representative of the full Board, I would hope. Shockingly, some of those views showed up word for word, yet without attribution to Vice Chair Barr's report, in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's October 2023 report entitled, ``Report on the 2023 Banking Turmoil.'' According to recent information provided to this committee from Fed Chair Powell, ``The Federal Reserve staff contributed to and have opportunities to comment on various work products.'' So, I will have to be following up with you on that, but I am very concerned about that interaction. With that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Barr. The gentleman's time has expired. The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, is recognized. Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I thank the ranking member, and the witnesses for appearing. In my City of Houston, Texas, we had over a trillion gallons of water as a result of Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Over a 4-day period, 68 people died. It caused $125 billion in damages. Now, through a process known as security realization, banks bundle their loans and then indirectly issue them as securities. As climate change begins to impact these assets, these securities, such as mortgages, that are in these packages--doesn't that cause some concern for banks when the insurance companies decide that they are moving out, they are not going to insure? We find that if you can't get the insurance, you can't get the home, because the home has to have some level of insurance. Does that cause some concern for banks or should it? Ms. Gardineer. Congressman Green, of course, it does. We have a flood insurance rule, for example, that we have been dealing with for many years, and when we see changes like that, it does have an impact or the potential to have an impact on the financial institution that holds a mortgage. Mr. Green. Anyone else? Mr. Billingsley. No, I would agree. I think the issue you raise is how climate change can affect credit risk, and that is something we have been---- Mr. Green. This is just one, but there are many others, and I think that is what we have to concern ourselves with, how this climate change impacts these mortgages, these underlying securities, and to the extent that they can impact the bank itself, and that is where you come in. Do you have any other examples? Mr. Gibson. We do see banks looking at how climate-related financial risks affect their own loan portfolios or their business models, so banks are looking at those risks, yes. Mr. Billingsley. No, I would agree with Mike. It could also impact things like operational risk as well. Mr. Green. Say again? Mr. Billingsley. It could impact things like operational risk as well. Mr. Green. Operational risk? Okay. Ms. Gardineer. Congressman, I do think that when we issued, jointly, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk, it is precisely because we wanted to focus on risk management because of the increased frequency of weather-related and extreme weather on operational risks, supervisory issues, and the true impact it has on communities and individuals across the country. Mr. Green. Okay. Understanding that we have these risks, what is it that you can do to assure us to some extent--you can't guarantee--that banks will be in a position to deal with these risks that climate change will impose? What do you do? Mr. Gibson. We make it clear to banks that we expect them to measure and manage all of their material risks, including the climate-related financial risks that you are talking about, and we have the interagency guidance that was mentioned that has some principles around that. Mr. Green. Do you also concern yourself with how well they are capitalized? Mr. Gibson. There is no direct link from climate-related financial risks to capital requirements, but certainly, when banks are evaluating their own risks, they need to know whether their capital is sufficient for the risks they are taking, which would include all of their material risks. Mr. Green. But if the climate change impacts the underlying assets and the securities, does that not impact the financial market in some way? Mr. Gibson. Yes, and we are seeing investors who purchase those securities, and they will be trying to understand their risks, which are very targeted to the risks that they are investing in. So, it is possible that climate-related financial risks could be important for a particular security, and we see investors paying attention to that. Mr. Green. Thank you very much. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Mr. Barr. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize myself for 5 minutes. Director Gibson, the Basel Committee sets international capital and liquidity standards that the Fed uses as the basis for domestic regulations. Section 11(k) of the Federal Reserve Act, which you know very, very well, provides that, ``The Board of Governors may not delegate its functions to a Federal Reserve Bank for the establishment of policies for supervision and regulation,'' but the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is a member of the Basel Committee, as is the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. How does the Federal Reserve reconcile delegating to the New York Fed the ability to be a member of the Basel Committee, which establishes supervision and regulation policies that become incorporated into Board regulatory and supervisory policies, with Section 11(k)of the Act, which says that the Board may not delegate to a Federal Reserve Bank its functions for the establishment of supervision and regulation policies? Mr. Gibson. When the Board and the New York Fed participate in the Basel Committee, we are coordinating closely. We are not delegating anything, and we work together, and the Reserve Bank staff provide a lot of value. They have a lot of technical expertise. Mr. Barr. When you and the New York Fed are participating in the Basel Committee, do you represent the United States, or are you just participating in an international standard-setting exercise? Mr. Gibson. We are representing our agencies, and we are representing the United States. Mr. Barr. And U.S. energy companies that are fossil energy, carbon-emitting companies, do you have their interests in mind when you are there in Basel? The shareholders of fossil energy, carbon-emitting American companies, do you have their interests in mind? Mr. Gibson. We have our statutory responsibilities around bank supervision and safety and soundness in mind. Mr. Barr. Yes, and when European standard-setters ask you to pressure banks to disinvest in or de-bank fossil energy companies, what do you say to them? Mr. Gibson. I would say that we don't direct banks to lend to any particular customer. That is the bank's decision. Mr. Barr. And American shareholders who depend on the profitability of fossil energy companies, what do you say in defense of them when you are in the Basel Committee? Mr. Gibson. Again, in the Basel Committee, we are representing our statutory responsibilities for bank supervision and safety and soundness. Mr. Barr. Do you ever raise the issue of energy reliability and energy affordability in the context of these conversations at Basel? Mr. Gibson. That is not a main topic of the Basel Committee. We talk about---- Mr. Barr. You don't talk about that? You don't talk about the reliability of the American energy grid? You don't talk about energy affordability or shareholder returns for American energy companies when you are there? Mr. Gibson. That is not the focus of banks' supervision and---- Mr. Barr. What is the focus? Mr. Gibson. Banks' safety and soundness, and a strong economy and a strong banking system. Mr. Barr. Yes, and are banks more sound when they don't have good credit with energy companies? Mr. Gibson. Banks need to manage their credit risk with respect to all of their borrowers. Mr. Barr. Yes. Director Gibson, in one of our subcommittee hearings last year, you said that you did not know about the funding for the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). Have you had a chance to look more closely at NGFS funding, and if so, whether you think that with activist funding of research, that the NGFS at the Federal Reserve Board is still comfortable with the Board's participation in these NGFS meetings? Mr. Gibson. I have looked more into the NGFS funding. What I can tell you is that the NGFS is supported by voluntary contributions of the NGFS members and observers. However, external funding can also be provided to support projects commissioned for the benefit of the NGFS. The NGFS charter states that such contributions do not confer the contributor any right to define the priorities or influence the NGFS's work, and, of course, we do not contribute funding to the NGFS from the Federal Reserve. Mr. Barr. We are very obviously worried about the influence from who funds it. Director Gibson, can you describe the Climate Data Committee, including the Climate Data Hub, and the joint work with the Financial Stability Oversight Council's (FSOC's) Office of Financial Research's Climate Data and Analytics Hub over at Treasury? It seems like there is a lot of obsession with climate at the Fed. Mr. Gibson. I can't speak for the FSOC or the Treasury, but in terms of the Federal Reserve, we do have a staff group that is looking at climate data and what might be investments---- Mr. Barr. My time has expired, but we need patriotism. From our participation in international bodies, we need promotion of American energy dominance. We don't need yielding to European climate obsession. I yield back. The gentleman from California, Mr. Vargas, is recognized. Mr. Vargas. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Nice speech, but I would say what we really need to take a look at is the soundness of banks. That is what we are talking about here today, and I think banks are much more sound when they don't put their head in the sand, and take a look at what is happening nationally and internationally. There is climate change. Even the Republican witnesses who come up here, when I ask, do you believe in climate change, even they raise their hands. When I first got here, none of them would. Now, they do. Of course, it is happening. How could you possibly predict a run on the bank with climate change? You know what? If you have a local bank in Florida that is heavily invested in the real estate market there with mortgages, and you are invested in that bank or you have your money in that bank, and the first hurricane comes through--it is not even a Category 4, now it is a 5; they are creating new numbers now because these hurricanes are so large because of climate change--Hell yes, you want to get your money out of that bank. Is that bank going to be sound? No, and of course, it is going to impact what you do. It is ridiculous. It is a nice speech when they say, ``patriotism,'' the coal companies and all this. It is B.S, climate change is happening, and I am not against energy companies. I think it is important to support energy companies, but at the same time, we are talking about banking here and insurance. I was in insurance for a while, and I have to tell you, one of the things that they do is they take a look at what are real risks, and they take a look at Florida, and they take a look at California and other places. They know that because of climate change, it is becoming much more expensive to insure there, and they can't get the price that they need, so either they are pulling out or they are shrinking. They are not stupid, and of course that is why you are taking a look at this. As bankers, you have to. There are real risks; climate-related risks are real risks. Somehow, my friends on the other side think that they are made-up risks. They are imaginary risks. Ask that to the people in Texas, we talk about the hurricanes, the people in Florida, or the fires in California. See how imaginary they are. Anyway, I will shut up now. I had my speech just like the other side. I just want to make sure I said that because it is so ridiculous. By the way, it was the same thing with Dodd-Frank. When I got here, Dodd-Frank was the boogeyman. Dodd-Frank was bad. Now, it is the gold standard. Why are we going to Basel III? We have Dodd-Frank. It is so great. I do have some problems with Basel III, but I do want to say this: When we go and participate in these international organizations, are they dictating to us what to do? I think you have already testified no, right? Dr. Gibson, why don't we go to you first? Mr. Gibson. No. Nothing that is discussed in the international groups we participate in is binding on the Federal Reserve. Mr. Vargas. Yes, and the things that you talk about there, are they sneaky, nobody knows about them, and somehow they pop up, and then we have to enforce them here? Does that happen like my friends on the other side seem to be intimating? Mr. Gibson. The groups we participate in, like the Basel Committee, publish their work plan annually, they publish summaries of the meetings, so the topics are in the public domain that they are discussing. Mr. Vargas. Yes. In fact, we get them in our office. We get to see these things. I don't know why they don't get them over there on the other side. It seems pretty ridiculous to me. Now, I should ask you, because I do ask everybody, so I think it would only be fair, do you believe in climate change? If you could raise your hands?  Mr. Vargas. Okay. Thank you. That's pretty consistent now with what we have had, and, again, I think it is very important to do that. And the last thing I would say is this: There seems to be this notion that we shouldn't rely on professionals anymore, that somehow the politicians will get it right, and we should listen to what we say so much and not let you do your job. And maybe that is the anti-elitist fever and fervor that we hear, but let professionals do their job. If I need an operation, I am not going to let some kook operate on me; I want a doctor, someone who knows what they are doing. I want a professional to do that, and you guys are professionals. I hope they let you do your job. Again, I appreciate the work that you have been doing. I had a whole speech here, asking a whole bunch of other questions. Sometimes, they get my goat because of this whole climate-related imaginary thing, which is ridiculous. It is real, it is happening, it is big, and it is very problematic, and I am glad you all are taking a look at it. And with that, I will yield back, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Mr. Davidson. . I thank the gentleman. I now recognize myself for 5 minutes for questions. For a lot of my constituents back home, they will be sitting here watching this hearing, dozens of them, wondering what in the world has Basel, Switzerland, got to do with banks in America? Why do these globalist bankers keep going to Basel, Switzerland, and why do they make rules from these meetings in Basel and come to us? Why should we pay so much attention to Basel? Could you explain it to us, Dr. Gibson, what goes on in Basel and why it is important? Mr. Gibson. In the Basel Committee, we are participating to support our statutory responsibility domestically for supervision and regulation and financial stability---- Mr. Davidson. Our FSOC is supposed to submit to whatever happens in Basel? Mr. Gibson. Nothing that is agreed upon in Basel or developed there is binding, and we make decisions based on our domestic statutory mandates. Mr. Davidson. Under Dodd-Frank, under all bank regulations, so it is not really a treaty. It is just kind of this consensus that we should gather together regularly in Basel, Switzerland, and talk about the global financial markets and try to create some sort of stable international financial system. Mr. Gibson. Having common standards helps the global financial system because U.S. firms that want to operate abroad have rules that they are familiar with, because we have a somewhat harmonized---- Mr. Davidson. There is nobody from Basel making us do this. We are in a sense doing it to ourselves, right? Mr. Gibson. We participate voluntarily, yes. Mr. Davidson. Okay. I just wanted to be clear on that. Yesterday, our Housing and Insurance Subcommittee held a hearing on housing affordability in America, where we discussed the many issues homebuyers are facing in the current market. One issue we discussed briefly and I wanted to save for today's hearing is the clear impact the proposal on Basel III capital requirements is going to have on homeownership in America, especially for low- to moderate-income borrowers, and especially for our rural, minority, and first-time homebuyers across the country. Mortgages issued to these borrowers would require a risk weighting of 70 percent versus 50 percent, so a pretty big increase. What is very clear is that as a result of this 20-percent increase in the risk-weighted capital requirement for low- to moderate-income (LMI) mortgages, lenders will be forced to decrease their lending to these borrowers. Because of Basel III Endgame, fewer mortgages will go to rural communities. Fewer mortgages will go to minority borrowers. Fewer mortgages will go to hardworking Americans who want to buy their first home. The Basel III Endgame will definitely make homeownership in America more expensive and the housing affordability worse unless it is reworked. I will say that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve gave us some hope. Although he seems very committed to it, he seems to be open to reworking it. As we looked through this, I was reviewing several speeches and interviews that the Chairman of the Basel Committee has given in the last month, and he asserted that the Basel members are expected to have the outstanding standards implemented by the end of the year. Director Gibson, does that sound right to you, by the end of the year? Mr. Gibson. I would say the timing is uncertain, because we are reviewing all of the comments that we received, and we will have to analyze all of those comments. Mr. Davidson. This is also encouraging. When I hear folks in your position, or people like the Chairman of the Federal Reserve say, we may have to rework some things, that is essentially like what people back home might do screaming, it is a total disaster. We are going to have to fix it. So, I take it as good news because we know we have to fix it. Director Gibson, do you think that a robust public engagement, following the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), will ensure that whatever new capital requirements are fit for purpose for America's financial institutions? Mr. Gibson. Yes. That is the process we will do, and that is the goal we have. Mr. Davidson. For others on the panel, any other concerns about the impact of Basel III on homeownership or the ability for people to get a mortgage in America due to some consensus in Basel? Mr. Billingsley. Yes. The issue you raise is probably one of the most prominent comments we have received, so I view it as critically important to get it right. Mr. Davidson. Yes. I will just share from my personal experience as we look at the impact on small and mid-market firms as well. Public companies, big companies have access to the bond market. But for small and mid-market firms, their ability to access financial capital in America largely goes through banks. So, who is getting crippled? It is Main Street businesses over Wall Street companies. These are the businesses that dominate Southwest Ohio and a lot of America, a lot of where the jobs are. The ability to grow these businesses is hamstrung when you have globalist bankers come away from Switzerland and say, we are going to clamp down on lending. And it doesn't just hit homeowners, it hits businesses, and it hurts the growth rate in our whole economy. So, I hope it is very strongly reworked. My time has expired, and I now recognize the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Casten, for 5 minutes. Mr. Casten. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thanks to all of our witnesses. I think this has been a genuinely fascinating hearing. I just think it is mistitled, and I don't mean that to be sassy. I say that because I think the appropriate title for this hearing is how is it that the Republican Party, the party of Reagan, has become so uncomfortable with global leadership, and I am not just saying that to cast aspersions. The Chicago Council on Global Affairs, a wonderful organization in Chicago, just did a survey they released last month that said that for the first time in nearly 5 decades, a majority of Republicans said that the United States should stay out, of rather than play an active role, in world affairs. We are going to leave Congress this week, for 2 weeks, without even bringing a bill to the House Floor to provide aid to our friends in Ukraine to stand up to Vladimir Putin. It doesn't seem like that long ago that the leader of the Republican Party was saying, ``Tear down that wall, Mr. Gorbachev.'' Now, nobody wants to stand up to him. I can't find a single member of the Republican Party who is willing to suggest that someone who seems to have a fetish with the leader of North Korea, and is publicly refusing to support the United States obligations under Article 5 of NATO, to even say that might be problematic. And of course, yesterday, we had the Heritage Foundation in here, who has played a role in creating Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for the next Republican President, which suggests that the Treasury Department should withdraw from the World Bank, withdraw from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Commerce Department should pull out of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and terminate any program that even references the Paris Climate Accord. I guess my first question for you all is, do you believe that the United States should withdraw from international financial institutions and cede leadership to everybody else in the world? Does anybody agree with that proposition?  Mr. Casten. Good. Thank you. I am glad your organizations have done that. FDIC Chair Gruenberg recently said that climate change should not be viewed solely as a long-term threat, that weather events are already influencing insurance costs. We know that. Mr. Vargas has said that. It is affecting financial markets. Dr. Gibson, these are simple questions. But isn't it beneficial for the United States to actually sit at the table and collaborate with our international climate counterparts to minimize climate risks, to understand them? Mr. Gibson. Yes. We work with our international counterparts to support our statutory mandates. Mr. Casten. And shouldn't we be collaborating with regional banks, and other central banks, making sure that we are working in lockstep with them? Mr. Gibson. We do collaborate with other central banks, yes. Mr. Casten. Given the choice, would you like the United States to be in a leadership role at those tables or not at the table at all? Mr. Gibson. We do play a leadership role in a lot of these groups, yes. Mr. Casten. Thank you. Ms. Gardineer, do you agree that climate risks are global and will affect all entities, sectors, and economies? Ms. Gardineer. Yes, Congressman, I do. Mr. Casten. Wouldn't banks with a global footprint actually benefit from having the United States at that table instead of leaving U.S. multinational companies to wait and sit there and have to do the bidding of whatever other international sovereign nation sets those rules? Ms. Gardineer. It is really important for us to continue, and the value that we provide by having that collaboration with our global partners, I think, helps the United States and our financial system. Mr. Casten. I come back to what I said at the start. It is fascinating that this sounds like such a partisan exchange, that you all are answering such simple questions with simple obvious truths, and I have sympathy for all of my colleagues across the aisle. I don't know what I would do in their shoes. If my ability to hold this job depended on appealing to that small minority of Americans who do not believe that the United States should lead, but make up the majority of the Republican primary electorate. I get it, leadership is hard, but following people is the opposite of leadership. I thank you all for your leadership, I thank you for doing the right thing, and I hope that people who find leadership hard, find more satisfactory jobs than being a part of the leadership of the United States. Thank you, and I yield back. Mr. Davidson. I thank the gentleman. The gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Loudermilk, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Loudermilk. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank all of our witnesses for being here and representing your respective agencies. Dr. Gibson, last year, I asked you some questions about the processes of developing the Federal Reserve's Pilot Climate Scenario Analysis (CSA), and the sources of its funding. At the time, you didn't know, but I also understand Representative Barr asked this question earlier, and from what I understand, you told him that the NGFS was funded partly by voluntary contributions from member banks. Is that true? Mr. Gibson. Voluntary contributions from its members, which are central banks or supervisors, but they do accept external funding for certain projects that they run. Mr. Loudermilk. Okay. Since I wasn't physically in here, I want to make sure of those. Now, let me do a follow-on question on that. Do any U.S. bank supervisory agencies voluntarily contribute to the NGFS? Mr. Gibson. The Federal Reserve has not. Mr. Loudermilk. But you are not sure of any others? Mr. Gibson. I wouldn't want to speak for the others. Mr. Billingsley. The FDIC does not either. Mr. Loudermilk. Okay. Ms. Gardineer. The OCC does not. Mr. Loudermilk. Okay. Thank you. I just want to make sure that was clear. On to another question. Dr. Gibson, as the Director of Supervision and Enforcement at the Fed, do you think it is important that you know what assumptions are being made to support the proposals that come out of your division? Mr. Gibson. Yes. Mr. Loudermilk. Okay. In the participant instructions for the Pilot CSA, there were 75 references to the NGFS. In the instructions, the Fed asked banks to examine trajectories for climate and economic outcomes under hypothetical trajectories provided by the NGFS. Now, the Fed claims to have used NGFS trajectories because, ``these trajectories are considered plausible and illustrative scenarios and do not have probabilities attached to them.'' How did you evaluate whether these trajectories were plausible and what measure of plausibility was used? Mr. Gibson. When we were constructing the Pilot Climate Scenario Analysis, we considered the question of what scenarios to use and asked the banks to look at it. And we did, in those cases that you mentioned, decide to use scenarios that were produced by the NGFS, mainly because the banks were already familiar with them, so that would be the least-burdensome way to go about the exercise. Mr. Loudermilk. But was there a particular measure of plausibility other than what you have just described? Mr. Gibson. Our technical experts evaluated them and were comfortable, yes. Mr. Loudermilk. When did the Fed believe it was important that these scenarios do not have probabilities attached to them? Mr. Gibson. In our view, the scenarios that we were using for the Pilot Climate Scenario Analysis--I don't think we know enough to attach probabilities to them, and the purpose of the exercise was not to attach probabilities to them. The purpose of the exercise was to give banks a chance to evaluate those scenarios and look at how they are evaluating those risks and their risk management around climate-related financial risk. Mr. Loudermilk. But without any probabilities? Mr. Gibson. Without a probability attached. Mr. Loudermilk. Does the Fed formally endorse these scenarios as a supervisory standard when evaluating banks' adherence to the joint climate risk guidance issued last year by the Fed, the FDIC, and the OCC? Mr. Gibson. No. I would say these are not the scenarios that we would use as a standard. Mr. Loudermilk. Okay. A recent Basel Committee regulatory consistency assessment report says that U.S. agencies have adopted a stricter approach than the minimum standards prescribed by the Basel Committee. The stricter rules have not been considered as mitigants for the overall component level assessment of compliance. Dr. Gibson, is it correct that when U.S. standards are stricter than BCBS recommendations, the U.S. does not receive credit for those standards under the Basel Committee's rating scheme? Mr. Gibson. It is true that when the Basel Committee looks at countries' regulations, they are only looking for differences in the downside direction. They are not evaluating the differences in the other direction. Mr. Loudermilk. Okay. So if the U.S. doesn't receive credit for stricter standards, why exceed those standards? Mr. Gibson. We get a lot of benefit from having standards that are appropriate for the U.S., whether or not they are identical to Basel standards. Mr. Loudermilk. Okay. I see I am short on time, so I yield back. Mr. Davidson. I thank the gentleman. The gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Foster, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Foster. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and, again, to our witnesses. Many of you have mentioned the fact that the U.S. is often a leader in these international discussions. Why do you believe that the U.S. is a leader, or at least first among equals in these discussions? Is it the size of our GDP or the primacy of the dollar or our leadership in advanced technologies or just the expertise we have in certain areas? Is it explicitly written into the bylaws of these groups that the U.S. should have a leading role in these, or is it just de facto, because in a number of ways, we are the big dog in the international economy? Mr. Billingsley. I suppose I can start. For me, I think it starts with the FDIC's mission, so I will give you an example. The International Association of Deposit Insurers is an international organization we are involved in, and it is fair to say that the rest of the world looks to us as the premier way to do that, so I think that is a particular area where we are the social leadership. Mr. Foster. Yes. Are there areas you are aware of where other countries or other areas may have more expertise in international trade? Mr. Gibson. I would say one of the things we bring to the table is we have a high capacity for research and data analysis and that supports our engagement in these international groups, and it is often a way to move the international consensus to provide good data and arguments. I would say that is a strength of the U.S. participation. Ms. Gardineer. I would add to that the expertise that we have across all of our agencies at the OCC. We do have, I think, the perspectives of the largest globally-active institutions down to some of the smallest community banks, and that purview gives us a lot of leadership capability to take to these international forums. Mr. Foster. Now, another area where we might gain from engagement with other countries is when you see failures that occur in other countries. There was this famous incident with the deepfake impersonation on some sort of Zoom that caused a $25-million erroneous transfer. I believe that happened in Hong Kong, if I am right, so there are lessons to be learned there. The biggest G-SIB that has failed, the only one since Dodd- Frank, was Credit Suisse, so there may be lessons there from which we can benefit. We are only 5 percent of the population of the world, and there are lots of ways that financial institutions can mess up that might be discovered earlier in other countries. Are there examples you can think of where we really gained a valuable lesson from experiences offshore? Mr. Gibson. Just to give one example, the Basel Committee was founded 50 years ago because of the failure of a German bank that caused losses to U.S. banks through the foreign exchange market. And that was really the impetus for more international cooperation about what are cross-border banks doing and do we understand and supervise their risks adequately. That spurred more international cooperation because of the failure of a German bank. Mr. Foster. And have there been disasters averted that you can point to because of the understanding and this standardization, at least to some extent, of our approaches to different financial threats? Mr. Gibson. I would say that the fact that we have had strong regulatory standards in the U.S. has been a source of strength for our banking system and our economy. I can't point to particular banks where, because we did this, a bank didn't fail, but overall, I think we have a strong system. Mr. Foster. Yes. I came onto this committee in March of 2008 when the roof was about to cave in, and began educating myself about things. I was pointed to the Canadian banking system, which was stodgy and overcapitalized at the time. But then when the crisis hit, being over capitalized went from being something that would be a source of derision to something that made the Canadian banking system the envy of a lot of countries, including some in the United States. And I believe that there is a lot to be learned from looking at the other 95 percent of humanity. Historians say there are two basic ways for countries to fail, one of which is to seal themselves off from the rest of the world, and pretend like they know all the answers. The other one is to just have an extractive elite that sort of benefits the incumbents and preserves their economic and political power. There are a lot of both of those strands in this hearing, and I think to maintain our strength, we have to keep ourselves open to the world and particularly open to the world's ideas, and I thank you for your work in that regard. My time is up. I yield back. Mr. Davidson. I thank the gentleman. The gentleman from South Carolina, Mr. Norman, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Norman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As a follow-up, I will take Mr. Luetkemeyer's questions about the involvement with Chinese and Russian banks as far as Basel. Mr. Gibson, did I hear you right that the climate risk didn't affect any of its safeguards that Basel tries to implement--market risk, capital risk, operational risk? Mr. Gibson. When we think about climate-related financial risks, we ask banks to think about the ways that they could manifest through all of those traditional channels, so that is the way we would look at it. Mr. Norman. Okay. I think he asked this. Could you give me one climate risk that the banks are facing now of which they need to be aware? Give me an example. Is it forest fires? Is it hurricanes? Give me one example. Mr. Gibson. We did run this Pilot Climate Scenario Analysis last year that asked six large banks to look at, among other things, the scenario of a large hurricane hitting the East Coast and how that would affect their loan book. So, that is one example that banks have looked at. Mr. Norman. Mr. Billingsley? Mr. Billingsley. Yes. One good example is just the cost or availability of insurance, so that could impact the credit risk of an institution. Mr. Norman. Give me one climate risk that man can control, that would affect the banks and the Basel as far as the regulations and recommendations, and, as our friend from Georgia mentioned, there is no probability that is put with it. Mr. Billingsley. Right. I will agree with Mike that it is difficult to assign probabilities, but I think it is our job to assess all material risks, including ones where we can't assign probabilities. Mr. Norman. All three of you raised your hands about climate risk. What if a bank just gave you one sentence: ``We are not going to make allowances unless you define further with a probability of a climate risk.'' What would be the consequences? Ms. Gardineer. What we have done, Congressman, is look at climate-related financial risks, and looking at that and the impact it could have on all of the risk, like credit risk, operational risk, market risk, et cetera. Risk management is at the core and our safety and soundness is the focus of what we are looking at when we look at climate-related financial risk. Mr. Norman. But what would be the consequences of a bank that did that? Ms. Gardineer. I think if they were unable to manage their risk appropriately, our examiners would take normal courses of action to help them manage the risk to prevent any adverse consequences that could befall the bank or the communities. Mr. Norman. But Basel can't come up with a firm example of a climate risk. If it is a hurricane, if it is a forest fire, put a probability on that and how that directly affects the banks. Ms. Gardineer. I don't---- Mr. Norman. But you all raised your hands that this is a real crisis, and I guess I am just trying to further drill down to see exactly what, and for the money and time that you are requiring by the banks because they are going to suffer the consequences. I think the foreign banks are going to laugh at it. Mr. Luetkemeyer mentioned the involvement of China and Russia from a national security standpoint. I don't think they are our friends, having all the information from our financial records that you all have provided them, but I guess I am just trying to ask again about the climate risk, what are the foreign countries saying about your regulations and the consequences? Mr. Gibson. When we engage with our international counterparts in talking about climate risk, many of them have a lot more active policies than we do. Mr. Norman. Which country? Mr. Gibson. All of the other countries, pretty much. Mr. Norman. China? Mr. Gibson. I would say Europe stands out as being very active on climate risk, in my experience. Mr. Norman. What about China and Russia? Mr. Gibson. Not in my experience, no. Mr. Norman. Zero. They laugh at it. Mr. Gibson. Russia doesn't participate in the Basel Committee anymore. Mr. Norman. What about China? Mr. Gibson. They participate. But I would say on the topic of climate risk, we are really in the early stages of learning what are the links from climate change to the risks that banks have on their balance sheet. That is why we are trying to build the capacity to understand that better, and banks are building that capacity as well. Mr. Norman. I yield back. Mr. Davidson. I thank the gentleman. The gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Meuser, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Meuser. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you very much to the witnesses. A little earlier, we had a colleague making a very sanctimonious speech, which really doesn't make it in the real world and shouldn't here. I am not sure if my colleague understands that the United States--or knows his history--has done far better than the economies that we are trying now to collaborate with, as he put it, or to fall in lockstep. Leadership is not defined as falling in line with other weaker economies and bad ideas, and embracing Basel III is somehow described as leadership? No. No. Making Basel III better and forging a better path is leadership, and that is what we are trying to do. Not only that, every bank, every business that you speak to, large and small, has a problem with Basel III, the biggest banks in the country as well as very small community banks that come and see me. So, embracing Basel III Endgame is somehow leadership, and not falling in line is sanctimonious at best, and I find it very, very politically motivated because it doesn't make any sense coming from a fellow Member. Anyway, we have a concern about the preservation of U.S. business sovereignty, and in the development and adoption of international standards. We want to have our say, and it doesn't seem like we do when it comes to Basel III and many other rules that are being made. Mr. Gibson, how do your regulatory organizations prioritize U.S. business sovereignty and standards amidst the growing influence of international regulatory bodies on our financial regulations, such as the Corporate Sustainability Directive (CS3D) and other global paths, that the U.S. seems required to follow by your regulators? Mr. Gibson. When the Federal Reserve participates in international groups, we are supporting our statutory responsibilities around supervision and regulation and financial stability, and we are working to shape those standards and recommendations to the needs of the U.S. financial system. But the standards in those groups aren't binding, so we take decisions on our domestic mandates according to our domestic goals. Mr. Meuser. I don't know how many letters you got, and you couldn't even name one that was positive. I would love to see the positive letter, by the way, if that is at all possible. If that letter was from an actual stakeholder, I would love to see it, if you can produce that for this committee. How is CS3D in the interest of American small business, because EUR 150 million, you have to comply, not just in Europe, but in the United States of America. Have we ever heard such a thing before? I would like to ask you, Mr. Billingsley. Mr. Billingsley. Yes. Sure. Something like a CS3D is really sort of outside of the remit of the FDIC, so it is not something we are interested in. It is not something you will see come out of us. It is really a European thing. Mr. Meuser. Good, but according to Treasury Secretary Yellen, not necessarily. So that is a concern, and it seems to be a pattern to these global--how did he put it-- collaborations. Let me ask Comptroller Gardineer, please, how does the OCC balance international standards, from your perspective, of the U.S. banking system, ensuring U.S. businesses remain competitive? Ms. Gardineer. It gives us, Congressman, an opportunity, as we said earlier, to talk about raising standards, higher standards, and trying to ensure that there is a level playing field so that the U.S. financial system is not at a competitive disadvantage or losing market share to a more-lax jurisdiction that has lower standards or is leading a race to the bottom. Mr. Meuser. And maybe just for all of you, do we integrate in a sincere, important way industry feedback in these international discussions? Ms. Gardineer. Yes. Mr. Meuser. Okay. Ms. Gardineer. Yes, we do. Mr. Billingsley. Absolutely. Mr. Meuser. Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that, and, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Davidson. I thank the gentleman. The gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. Fitzgerald, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Fitzgerald. Obviously, we have discussed quite a bit about how the Basel proposal adopts legally-binding capital requirements originating from an organization that exhibits what in my estimation is no real legal authority. I have been particularly concerned with the proposals disincentivizing banks from offering conventional loans to first-time homebuyers and low- to moderate-income borrowers. This is an issue that I think if you are a Member of Congress, you are going to hear about continually when you are back in the district, and I think the lack of options will make buying a home even more unattainable than it already is today, certainly for Wisconsinites right now. Another major issue is the proposal's operational risk component requiring banks to hold capital against fee and commission income as a proxy for operational risk. Under the proposal, a Wisconsin manufacturer trying to ship products internationally would need to pay more to get a bank letter of credit in order to facilitate those shipments, ultimately leading to higher costs or reduced availability for its products. In kind of a similar fashion, foreign direct investment in Wisconsin could be negatively impacted due to the increased capital, and the burden associated with that capital on foreign banks helping facilitate investment in Wisconsin. These issues, I think, kind of highlight the lack of analysis on how the proposal could affect users. Mr. Gibson, Vice Chair Barr has promised more analysis on the final rule, but why not do this analysis up front to increase the likelihood of kind of a better final product, I guess you could say? Mr. Gibson. The notice of proposed rulemaking last year had an analysis of the impact, and we are doing more work during the comment period, and we got comments about the impact. We also did a special data collection during the comment period to be able to assess the impact, so we are going to take all that into account going forward. Mr. Fitzgerald. So, you are comfortable with the amount of information that is available to make those series of decisions, I guess, at this point? Mr. Gibson. We are doing more work during the comment period with the information from the comments as well as from the special data collection, so we will be providing more information in the future, yes. Mr. Fitzgerald. Okay. Members of the military are routinely subjected to deployments and kind of permanent changes of station and, therefore, more likely to have kind of longer periods of time when they don't use open credit lines, I guess is the best way to describe it. In fact, active duty and reserve military members are 30 percent more likely than the general public, within a 2-year period, to make a purchase using a credit card that hasn't had any activity in the last 12 months. Under the Basel III Endgame proposal, off-balance-sheet items like unused credit card lines will be subject to an increased credit conversion factor applied to undrawn funds, reflecting the expected amount that could become an on-balance- sheet exposure, I guess, at some point. Due to the proposed conversion factor, banks could be incentivized to reduce or close unused or dormant credit lines to reduce their capital requirements. Let me just ask you, along those lines, have the agencies adequately contemplated the unique effect that the proposed conversion factor would have, specifically on servicemembers and the military community and their overall credit score? Mr. Gibson, I don't know if you have a comment on that? Mr. Gibson. Just to say that we have received those comments through the public comment process, so we are going to be carefully evaluating those and looking at them, yes. Mr. Fitzgerald. And before I run out of time, the capital proposal from the Fed and other financial regulators would impose huge costs on regional and mid-sized banks with little to no trading books to adopt the governance and data processes related to the new market risk rule. This proposal, on top of the other recent regulatory proposals, is bound to lead to, I am sure, some type of consolidation to overcome the compliance burden on the rulemaking. Do you believe allowing more banks to grow through acquisitions so that they are able to compete with the existing large banks would benefit the current ecosystem? And are you all worried about kind of damaging the breadth of the banking system, which obviously is kind of a national asset, by promoting more concentration and fewer regional banks who serve communities directly? Mr. Gibson. I would say we benefit from having a banking system with a diversity of institutions, including large, regional, and community banks. Mr. Fitzgerald. Very good. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Davidson. I thank the gentleman. The gentleman from New York, Mr. Torres, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Torres. Thank you. In January 2022, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, ``Capital and liquidity levels at our largest, most systemically important banks are at multi-decade highs.'' In June of 2023, Fed Chair Powell described the banking system as, ``very strongly capitalized.'' In June of 2023, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said, ``Our banking system is well-capitalized. There is adequate capital and liquidity in America's banking system.'' Dr. Gibson, do you agree with those statements from the Fed Chair and the Treasury Secretary? Mr. Gibson. Yes. Mr. Torres. The Fed Chair's repeated reassurances about a well-capitalized banking system seems to flatly contradict Basel III's assumption of an undercapitalized banking system. What do you make of that contradiction? Mr. Gibson. The main objective of the Basel III Endgame proposal was to make capital requirements more risk-sensitive and more consistent and adequately reflect risk. That is the goal. Mr. Torres. Do you think the banking system is undercapitalized or sufficiently capitalized?? Mr. Gibson. That is one of the things we are looking at through the comment period. We have gotten a lot of comments about that and we are going to evaluate it. Mr. Torres. Because Fed Chair Powell described it as very strongly capitalized, and the rhetoric from the Fed historically did seem to suggest that it is sufficiently capitalized, I ask myself, given the well-capitalized state of the banking system, are we fixing what ain't broken? What is the actual need for Basel III? A common refrain that I have heard about Basel III is that the United States must conform to European standards of banking, and I am wondering, where did we get this notion that the United States, as the financial superpower of the world, must conform to European standards of banking? As a U.S. policymaker, the most important question for me is not whether the U.S. banking system is acting in conformity with Europe's banking system. The most important question is whether the U.S. banking system is achieving the best possible balance between economic growth and financial stability. That should be the question that matters to all of you. And do you believe, as I do, that the end goal should not be the Europeanization of the U.S. financial system; the end goal should be the optimization of economic growth and financial stability? Mr. Gibson. Our goal is a strong U.S. banking system to support a strong U.S. economy. Mr. Torres. Do you agree that the goal should be the optimization of economic growth and financial stability? Mr. Gibson. Yes. Mr. Torres. Okay. And have you conducted a study aimed at determining the level of capital requirements that would produce the optimal amount of economic growth and financial stability? Mr. Gibson. The notice of proposed rulemaking last year included that information, and we have received a lot of comments about that and we are evaluating those. Mr. Torres. Have you conducted a study? Mr. Gibson. There were studies cited in the notice of proposed rulemaking---- Mr. Torres. But has the Federal Reserve itself conducted a study to determine what level of capital requirements would produce the optimal amount of economic growth and financial stability? It is a simple yes-or-no question. Mr. Gibson. Yes, and it was cited in the proposal last year. Mr. Torres. Okay. You did conduct a study? Mr. Gibson. It is in the proposal. Mr. Torres. Okay. There are those who insist that Basel III capital requirements would have no impact on access to credit. The laws of economics tell us that there is no such thing as a free lunch, right? Nothing is free. Everything has a cost. Do you believe that Basel III is an exception to the laws of economics, that Basel III is somehow a free lunch that would have no impact on the availability of credit? Mr. Gibson. There are definitely costs and benefits. Mr. Torres. It would have an impact on the availability of credit. There are housing finance agencies that have expressed concerns about the impact of Basel III on the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit equity investments, 85 percent of which come from the banking system. There are housing organizations that have expressed concerns about the impact of Basel III on minority borrowers and LMI borrowers who disproportionately access mortgages with lower down payments and higher loan-to- value ratios. Do you acknowledge that those are genuine tradeoffs? Mr. Gibson. Yes, and we have gotten a lot of comments on exactly those issues, and we are definitely going to carefully consider those as we work on the final rule. Mr. Torres. And you agree that an Act of Congress supersedes a Basel III recommendation. Is that fair to say? Mr. Gibson. Yes. Mr. Torres. So if there were a conflict between a congressional statute and a Basel III recommendation, the congressional statute should prevail, because there have been concerns that there is a conflict between Basel III's requirement for standardization and Congress' requirement for regulatory tailoring? Mr. Gibson. Any proposal we make would be evaluated by our lawyers to make sure it is consistent with the statutory---- Mr. Torres. I see my time has expired. Mrs. Kim. . I now recognize the gentleman from Nevada, Mr. Horsford, for 5 minutes. Mr. Horsford. Thank you to the Chair and to the ranking member, and thank you to our financial regulators for appearing before the committee. The U.S. banking system is not only the powerhouse of our economy, creating jobs and opportunities across the country, but it is also the envy of the world, drawing capital from across the globe. It is our interconnected and global economy, our prosperity, which is inherently tied to the stability of the world markets. American authority on the world stage and close coordination with our allies makes us all safer from foreign adversaries but also from catastrophic economic shocks. And yet, there are those in the hearing today who have continued to demand that we abandon our international partners regardless of the risk. Our nation is certainly not stronger because of their continued criticism of the United Nations, their constant threats to pull out of NATO entirely, or their attempts to undermine efforts that protect the global financial markets. While we have outpaced our peer nations in our recovery, there are still looming risks that we must be able to work cooperatively with other countries to mitigate. One of these looming risks to our global economy is the ever-present dangers presented by climate change. It is a common refrain that America cannot stop the catastrophic effects of man-made climate change on its own, and yet, here we are, as some of my colleagues advocate to further weaken our ability to garner international buy-in and to create a coalition large enough to tackle this very real problem. Our regulators and the Financial Stability Oversight Council established a committee specifically to advise on climate-related financial risk, but as this is a global issue, there is still more that we need to do to improve global monitoring and mitigation efforts. Banks and other companies are already hard at work dealing with the well-documented reality of climate-related financial risks because they already know that these risks are all too real. Dr. Gibson, what are the potential impacts on banks to carry out vital services like lending to small businesses, supporting minority communities, or to sector-wide stability, if climate change-induced risks are ignored? Mr. Gibson. We are looking to make sure that banks are evaluating all of their material risks, including climate- related financial risks, and firms are looking at how climate change could impact their business models and their balance sheets. And as bank supervisors, we need to understand their operations and their risks. Mr. Horsford. Thank you very much for that answer, and I hope that we will all remember that the consequences of climate change will not be borne equally across the socioeconomic ladder. The safety and soundness of the global financial sector is crucial, but an equally important aspect of our continued coordination with international financial regulators is to reduce global regulatory arbitrage. Regulatory arbitrage arises when banks are able to escape jurisdictions with more-stringent regulations in favor of less- stringent ones, and our efforts to minimize the possibilities for these actions are critical to ensuring that more work capital remains within our borders. Our participation in international agreements and leadership in global organizations, both of which are attacked by the legislation posted for today's hearing, allow us to encourage other countries to have strong safeguards similar to those found here in the United States. Mr. Billingsley, would you please discuss the effects on American competitiveness if we were to lose our global leadership in the financial sector and create an opportunity for increased instances of regulatory arbitrage? Mr. Billingsley. Certainly. I think the issue you raise is very important. The extent to which we can influence global minimum standards in a way that is in the best interest of the FDIC, that is in the best interest of the U.S. banking system, that makes the global financial system safer, I think that makes our banking system safer. Mr. Horsford. Just to close, I would like to reiterate to all of you that when we are participating in any of these international agreements, specifically around capital requirements, we must be conscious of the unintended impacts to segments of our population who have been traditionally excluded from the financial sector. Dr. Gibson, what processes does the Fed have in place to better understand and mitigate the effects of these regulations on communities of color or other marginalized communities? Mr. Gibson. We evaluate those impacts when we look at proposed regulations, and we have certainly received comments about that and we we evaluate them as part of our rulemaking process. Mr. Horsford. And I hope you will do the same as it pertains to Basel III, in line with the questions from my colleague, Mr. Torres. With that, I yield back. Mrs. Kim. Thank you. I now recognize myself for 5 minutes of questioning, and I want to thank all of the witnesses for being here today. I am all for U.S. participation in international bodies, and I see the importance and value in doing so. However, I also believe that involvement in global governance bodies does not mean financial regulators have a blank check to agree to international standards without properly consulting Congress. We need more transparency when U.S. financial regulators engage other countries on regulations that could reduce access to credit and capital for millions of American families and small businesses. Furthermore, our financial regulators should not constrain our global competitiveness by gold-plating regulations through proposals like the Basel III Endgame. I want to ask you, Director Gibson, would you agree that the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's core goal is to harmonize regulatory standards across international jurisdictions? Mr. Gibson. Yes, as well as supervisory cooperation. Mrs. Kim. Yes. Sure. Since you agree, do you believe that the current Basel III Endgame proposal goes against the Basel Committee's goal, since our international peers are watering down their own standards while we are gold-plating? Mr. Gibson. The Basel Committee recognizes that each country has to take back the standards to their domestic context and make sure that what we do domestically is appropriate to our banking system and our economy. So, we do that process, and we don't just automatically copy it over. Mrs. Kim. Yes. To me, it seems that we are fragmenting international standards rather than harmonizing, which could lead to greater risk for our financial stability. I want to point to the recent BCBS Regulatory Consistency Assessment Programme report, which states, ``In the following areas, the U.S. agencies have adopted a stricter approach than the minimum standards proscribed by the Basel Committee. The stricter rules have not been considered as mitigants for the overall or component-level assessment of compliance.'' So, I want to ask all three of you, our witnesses, is it your understanding that when the BCBS looks at the U.S. capital standards and their compliance with BCBS recommendations, stricter U.S. standards in some areas do not receive credit under the Basel Committee's rating scheme? Mr. Billingsley. I think that is generally true. The way the assessments typically work is they are identifying areas where a jurisdiction standard might be below the global minimum rather than above. Mrs. Kim. I want to hear it from you two, as well. Ms. Gardineer. I think that is an accurate statement. Mrs. Kim. Mr. Gibson? Mr. Gibson. Yes. The consistency assessments focus on deviations in the downward direction, not deviations in the upward direction. Mrs. Kim. Okay. I want to ask you, Senior Deputy Comptroller Gardiner, does Acting Comptroller Hsu monitor what OCC staff and officials are doing in their work with various global governance bodies such as the Basel Committee and NGFS, and are there regular reports on what staff and officials are doing and why they are doing it? Ms. Gardineer. Yes. The staff that participate in any of the global forums that we are members of, regularly report back to the Acting Comptroller to get his position for the agency as we continue. That is an ongoing communication. Mrs. Kim. Thank you. I have the same question about Chair Gruenberg's knowledge in monitoring what goes on with FDIC staff and officials at the global governance bodies. Deputy Director Billingsley, can you answer that? Mr. Billingsley. Absolutely. It is very similar to what Grovetta just stated. Anything we do at the staff level at any international engagement is done so with the direction of the Chairman. Mrs. Kim. And, Director Gibson, I have the same question about Chair Powell's or Vice Chair for Supervision Barr's knowledge in monitoring. Mr. Gibson. Both Chair Powell and Vice Chair for Supervision Barr sit on the Basel Committee's governance body, and the staff will be briefing Vice Chair for Supervision Barr on what is going on in the meetings and also to Chair Powell when it rises to that level. Mrs. Kim. Thank you. I know my time is up. The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Nickel, has joined us, so I will recognize him for 5 minutes. Mr. Nickel. Thanks so much to our witnesses for being here. I would like to talk about the dominance of the U.S. dollar across the globe. The dollar is the world's dominant reserve currency, which has significant advantages for the United States. Because other countries hold and use dollars for international trade, reserves and investments, the dollar is always in high demand, and the U.S. is able to pay less to borrow money because of it. American businesses and consumers can enjoy lower interest rates and easier access to foreign markets. Unfortunately, given China's growth, there are already challenges to the dollar's influence. The dollar's share of official reserves fell to a 20-year low of 58 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022. We cannot afford to risk losing the economic and political benefits of the dollar's dominance. Loans will be more expensive for the government, businesses, and for the working families I represent in North Carolina's 13th district. The dollar's unique status also enables us to influence global economic policies and maintain a significant role in international financial institutions. U.S. regulators are engaged in critical international conversations about cross- border payments. The G20 released a roadmap for enhancing cross-border payments to make them faster, cheaper, and more transparent while maintaining safety and security. I believe that the U.S. must be at the table for these talks to advocate for our interests, such as maintaining the dollar's role as the global reserve currency. The Financial Stability Board, or FSB, is the international body that coordinates the implementation of the roadmap, but partisan legislation put forward today would likely undermine U.S. regulators' ability to actually work with the FSB. If Republican legislation prevents our regulators from engaging in these conversations, we risk being left out of the global economy. Dr. Gibson, my first question is for you. Chair Powell said here in the Financial Services Committee that, ``The status of the dollar as the world's reserve currency is a very important thing to us.'' Do you agree with him? Mr. Gibson. Yes. Mr. Nickel. And do you agree that U.S. regulators, like the Fed, should be involved in international conversations with the FSB and G20? Mr. Gibson. Yes. We benefit from those international discussions. Mr. Nickel. And how do we benefit? Mr. Gibson. We are able to influence the discussion in the international groups in a way that supports our objectives of a strong U.S. economy. Mr. Nickel. And if the Congressional Banking Regulation Priorities and Accountability Act that was noticed for this hearing were enacted, what implications would that have for the Fed? Mr. Gibson. I haven't looked at the details of the legislation. We would be happy to look at it and get back to you. Mr. Nickel. Next to you, again, Dr. Gibson, how does the Federal Reserve plan to collaborate with other U.S. regulatory bodies and international counterparts to maintain the dollar's influence in these discussions? Mr. Gibson. When we participate in the international groups you mentioned, like the G20 or the FSB, that are talking about issues like cross-border payments, we work with the other U.S. participants. In the FSB, it is the Federal Reserve, Treasury, and the SEC, and we would all work together to support the goal of a strong dollar. Mr. Nickel. And what benefits would the U.S. lose if the dollar were no longer a global reserve currency? Mr. Gibson. You mentioned some of the benefits already, which is that it strengthens our economy. It allows our debt markets to be very liquid, which has benefits across our entire economy. Mr. Nickel. Chair Powell was recently here. He talked a lot about interest rates and where we are as an economy. If you would like, you are welcome to say, ``soft landing,'' a few times. If you want to take that opportunity, please, by all means go ahead. Mr. Gibson. I can't comment on any monetary policy. Mr. Nickel. I think the gist of my conversation with him afterwards is he was never going to say those words either just because it is a jinx, but I am pleased at where we are heading and yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Nunn. . I now recognize myself for 5 minutes. I want to thank the witnesses for being here in front of this committee today. You are all entrusted to be independent in protecting the strength of the American economy in your respective agencies. However, in my short 14 months here as a freshman Member of Congress, I have witnessed continuous politically-charged decisions and, I would offer, backroom discussions that have left many folks out, including members on this committee on both sides of the aisle, as well as folks back in my hometown. I believe that we should all agree at the forefront that folks in Altoona, Iowa, should have a much larger say in our future economic success than modeling a regulatory structure that is being decided in Brussels, Belgium. With that, in January, I led a bipartisan letter to your agencies, along with a Senator from Kansas, Jerry Moran, who emphasized the impact of increasing bank capital requirements on the economy and the impact on our constituents, particularly those in the agricultural community. It was signed not only by bipartisan Members of this committee in the House, but also in the Senate. I was happy that the Fed at least acknowledged that we sent the letter over. And while you didn't provide any detail in here other than an acknowledgement that you received the letter, I am still waiting to hear from the other two agencies, who have just turned a blind eye to responding to this committee. That is disappointing, so let me be clear: The actions of your agencies are hurting families back in small towns in Iowa as well as in large communities across the country. Director Gibson, your boss at the Fed stated that the Fed will make substantial changes to the final Basel III proposal. Is it correct that the next draft includes concerns that my farmers voiced months ago? Mr. Gibson. We have heard those comments, and they will be reviewed as we work on the final rule, yes. Mr. Nunn. The follow-up then is, could these end-user concerns or other concerns have been mitigated if you had listened to them on the front end of this? Mr. Gibson. We go through a public comment process precisely to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to comment, so we are getting those comments now, and we are carefully reviewing them. Mr. Nunn. For all of the panelists, I just want to be clear here. Would you agree that U.S. stakeholder input on the front end of these decisions is important for you to be able to execute on the backend when you make these decisions? Can I get a verbal yes or no? Mr. Billingsley. Yes, I think it is important. That is the purpose of the rulemaking. Ms. Gardineer. Yes, it does support the rulemaking process. Mr. Nunn. I agree. Mr. Gibson. Yes, that is part of our rulemaking process. Mr. Nunn. Good. I hope that we continue to have that before rather than after, and now I want to talk about competitiveness. Right now, we are holding American companies to international regulatory standards when, despite this action by the current Administration, our economy remains the envy of the world. In fact, the U.S. has 4.4 percent of the world's overall population. As we all know, we have over 50 percent of the equities and debt raised in the world. So for each of you, if the world comes to us for capital market solutions, then why do we continue to look to Europe as the leader when it comes to its financial markets? This is not a rhetorical question. It is one that we are currently engaged in. And why are your bodies imposing more-stringent standards on an American company when our international peers implement the minimum recommendations for global standards, as we have seen time and time again? Mr. Gibson. We are proposing rules like the capital proposal based on our domestic statutory mandates, and that is what we consider. And we have received the comments and we are evaluating those. Mr. Nunn. Mr. Billingsley? Mr. Billingsley. I think, to Mike's point, we are trying to implement rules in the United States that are fit for purpose here, but the comment process is critically important. Ms. Gardineer. As we engage in the rulemaking process, Congressman, I think we take into account the particularities of the U.S. financial system in proposing and then receiving comments that we take into account before we move forward to finalize any rule. Mr. Nunn. Just as a quick reminder for all of us here, the U.S. economy continues to lead because of the great success of the American enterprise, and including that of the rest of the world continues to follow our lead. Perhaps, we should emphasize the fact that we are leading in this area and not continue to restrict in this area, in my feelings, very arbitrarily. I remain concerned that if we continue on this path, every agency will be a climate regulator in 5 years, across-the-board here. Director Gibson, is it consistent with the Federal Reserve to say it is not a climate policymaker while simultaneously being committed, throughout the Fed's work, that furthering the NGFS goals amounts to a climate policymaking regime? Mr. Gibson. The Federal Reserve is not a climate policymaker. We have responsibility for bank supervision and bank safety and soundness, and we only take climate-related financial risks into account to the extent they interact with our existing mandate. Mr. Nunn. My time has expired. At this point, I would like to thank Dr. Gibson, Mr. Billingsley, and Ms. Gardineer for your testimony today. I know this has been a long process, and I appreciate you all being here. The Chair notes that some Members may have additional questions for this panel, which they may wish to submit in writing. Without objection, the hearing record will remain open for 5 legislative days for Members to submit written questions to these witnesses and to place their responses in the record. Also, without objection, Members will have 5 legislative days to submit extraneous materials to the Chair for inclusion in the record. The hearing is now adjourned. Thank you.
