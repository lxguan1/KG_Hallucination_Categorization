Chairman WILLIAMS. Before we get started, I want to
recognize Congresswoman Maloy from the great State of Utah to
say the Pledge of Allegiance and a short prayer.
Ms. MALOY. Prayer first. Our Father in heaven, we thank
thee for the opportunity we have to .
Please rise for the Pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America. And to the Republic for which
it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and
justice for all.
Chairman WILLIAMS. Good morning. This Committee will come
together in order. Without objection, the Chair is authorized
to declare a recess of the Committee at any time.
Today's first order of business is to consider the views
and estimates on the priorities of the Committee on Small
Business for fiscal year 2025. Then we will briefly adjourn to
reset the room for a full Committee hearing, which will take
place immediately following this meeting.
I now recognize myself for an opening statement.
It is no secret to anyone that small businesses are the
engines of our economy, and we rely on them heavily. In my
opinion, a key component of the American dream is the ability
to start your own business, to take a risk, work hard, and be
rewarded for that hard work. It is this Committee's job to
ensure the SBA's programs are working efficiently and
effectively to the benefit of all of our small businesses, and
to ensure there is a positive ROI, return on investment, for
the American taxpayer.
The budget views and estimates presented today for this
upcoming fiscal year note the SBA faces a significant number of
challenges. We as a Committee commit to conducting oversight
over systematic failures in the SBA and to promote legislative
change that will ensure small businesses have access to the
capital assistance they need to succeed.
With that, I yield to distinguished Ranking Member, Ms.
Velazquez, for 5 minutes for any remarks she may wish to make
on the budget views and estimates.
Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this
markup today on the Committee's views and estimates of the
Small Business Administration.
Our nation's 33 million small businesses are the heart and
soul of our nation. They employ 46 percent of our nation's
workers, creating good paying jobs in our communities. They get
more money circulating the local economy, lifting up
neighborhoods, restaurants, and retail shops. And they increase
the tax base, leading to community improvements, like better
schools, roads, and greenspaces. But more work needs to be
done, and I am committed to working with Chairman Williams to
make important budgetary decisions for the SBA programs.
The submission of this document to the Budget Committee is
an important aspect of the Committee's work, and I am sure my
colleagues will agree that it would have been better to wait
until we pass a full and complete budget for our current fiscal
year of 2024. It would also be incredibly helpful to wait for
the President to submit his proposed budget for fiscal year
2025, so we can appropriately react to those requests. Having
the agency's up to date information and projections would
enhance our recommendations to the Budget Committee.
While not ideal timing, I appreciate the bipartisanship to
find agreement on improving programs and oversight at the Small
Business Administration. We agree with much of the majority's
views. For example, recommending that SBA take steps to improve
its capital access, procurement, and entrepreneurial
development programs is prudent governance. federal funding for
SBA's entrepreneurial development programs to provide free or
low-cost counseling and training to more than a million
entrepreneurs each year is an area we both remain committed to.
I look forward to working with the Chairman to reauthorize this
program.
We also agree that SBA procurement programs maximize small
business participation in the federal marketplace, which in
turn boosts competition, lower prices, and expands our nation's
supplier base. Robust funding is imperative if we want to
provide this program with the personnel and resources needed to
adequately meet their intent.
Despite much consensus, there are still areas we differ,
which is perfectly normal. For instance, it is a Democratic
priority to do more to provide working families and
entrepreneurs with resources like childcare, give second
chances to returning citizens who were previously incarcerated,
and provide robust oversight funding to our OIG to ensure we
are holding fraudsters accountable.
And finally, we do not dispute that agencies need to follow
the process to reduce regulatory burdens for small firms, but
we oppose a blanket rejection of regulations that safeguard
health, safety, and environment. Instead, we must proceed with
thoughtful deliberation to tailor regulation for small
businesses and provide compliance assistance.
I thank the Chairman again for holding this markup and look
forward to working together in a bipartisan way to further
foster entrepreneurship. Thank you, and I yield back.
Chairman WILLIAMS. The lady yields back. And are there any
other Members who wish to be recognized for a statement on the
views and estimates on the priorities of the Committee for
fiscal year 2025?
Seeing none, the Committee now moves to consideration of
the views and estimates. A copy of the proposed views and
estimates has been distributed to Members in advance. Without
objection, the views and estimates are considered read and open
for amendment.
Does any Member seek recognition for the purpose of
offering an amendment?
Seeing no amendments, the question is on adopting the views
and estimates on the priorities on the Committee for fiscal
year 2025.
All those in favor, say aye.
All those opposed, say no.
In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it, and the
views and estimates are agreed to.
If there is no further business, this concludes today's
markup. Without objection, the staff is authorized to make
technical and confirming changes, and Members have until
February 29 to submit the additional supplemental dissenting
and minority views.
I would like to thank everyone for participating today.
Without objection, the Committee stands adjourned.
Members, please stay seated. We will bring in the witnesses
for today's hearing, which will start momentarily.
