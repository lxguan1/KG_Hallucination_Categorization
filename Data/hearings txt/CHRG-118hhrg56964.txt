Chairwoman Foxx. The Committee on Education and the Workforce will come to order. I note that a quorum is present. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to call a recess at any time. Since October 7th, this Committee and the Nation have watched in horror as so many of our college campuses, particularly the most expensive so called elite campuses, have erupted in the hotbeds of antisemitism and hate. Dr. Shafik, Mr. Schizer, Ms. Shipman and Mr. Greenwald, you are here testifying today because Columbia University is one of the worst of those hotbeds, and we have seen far too little, far too late done to counter that and protect students and staff. Columbia stands guilty of gross negligence at best, and at worst has become a platform for those supporting terrorism and violence against the Jewish people. For example, just 4 days after the harrowing October 7 attack, a former Columbia undergraduate beat an Israeli student with a stick, while shouting racial epithets. The following day a crowd of anti-Israel protestors marched on the University's Kraft Center for Jewish Life, causing the building to be locked down, and forcing Jewish students to shelter inside. More recently on March 24, anti-Israel groups hosted a ``Resistance 101'' event in a Columbia dorm featuring speakers linked to U.S. and Israel-designated foreign terrorist organizations, including the PFLP. Speakers explicitly endorsed terrorism and called on students to support it. This unauthorized event was nevertheless promoted by Columbia faculty and staff. That a taxpayer funded institution would become a forum for the promotion of terrorism raises serious questions. Moreover, Columbia administrators have repeatedly failed in their duty to protect Jewish students from this hateful, retrograde form of discrimination. Do not take my word for it. In February, Columbia undergraduate Eden Yadegar told the Committee, ``It is impossible to exist as a Jewish student at Columbia without running face first into antisemitism every single day. Jew hatred is so deeply embedded in the campus culture that it has become casual and palatable among students and faculty and neglected by administrators.'' Let me repeat, ``Neglected by administrators.'' Eden and some of her fellow Jewish classmates are in attendance today. I believe they deserve direct and clear answers about how you will address their concerns. I need not remind you that this not just a moral duty, but a legal duty set forth in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Finally, as the Committee convenes today to conduct its solemn oversight duty of postsecondary education, I can confidently say that never has this duty been more important. The raw, visceral reaction of the Nation to the unveiling of antisemitism at so-called elite institutions is indicative of the growing disconnect between the people and those universities. This is evidenced by a general loss of public trust and faith in postsecondary education. We are headed down a dark path if we cannot agree on basic shared moral values, such as the implication of calls for genocide. Bright lines must be drawn before the reputational damage to American universities is endemic and intractable. With today's hearing I hope to draw those bright lines. This is an opportunity for each of you to address the public directly and explain your stance on one of the great moral issues of our time. Antisemitism must have no safe harbor in American universities. With that, I yield to the Ranking Member for an opening statement.   Mr. Scott. Thank you, Dr. Foxx, and I thank our witnesses today for appearing with us. I would like to start my opening statement with a video from the 2017 rally to remind everyone of what happened at the University of Virginia campus during a Unite the Right Rally. As a warning, this video may contain some graphic content.  Thank you. As shown in the video white supremacists marched through the grounds of the University of Virginia in 2017 chanting slogans such as ``Jews will not replace us.'' At the time, I wrote a letter to my republican colleagues asking for a hearing to discuss rising tensions and discrimination on college campuses. I have that letter with me today, and I would like to ask for unanimous consent to enter that letter into the record. Chairwoman Foxx. Without objection.   Mr. Scott. Regrettably the country was denied the opportunity to address this issue 7 years ago. What we saw in the video is not an isolated event. It is the byproduct of this country's century long history of white supremacy and antisemitism. We should not faint surprise that there is hate speech on America's college campuses. The fact is, college campuses are polarized, as is our society, and we witness the disturbing rise in incidents, not only in antisemitism, but also in racism, Islamophobia, homophobia and other forms of hate. Nonetheless, schools have a responsibility to foster campus environments that promote understanding, respectful dialog, and above else student safety for all students. Jewish students, in fact all students, have a right to attend college free from hostility, and in compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. There is no excuse for antisemitism on campus, and everyone is entitled to a safe harbor that my colleague, the Chair referred to. As Dr. Shafik notes in her testimony, ``While there may be some easy cases, drawing a line between permissible and impermissible campus speech is enormously difficult. The U.S. Supreme Court has struggled for more than two centuries to define the limits of free speech under the First Amendment, and that struggle continues. Do not expect universities to figure it out overnight.'' Now, this moment requires thoughtful and nuanced discussion, something this Committee has not always done. Moreover, we should expand the scope of our conversation to include the students who are actually being denied access to an education as a result of discrimination. We should not put on political theater or see the strategy as the aftermath as an opportunity just to grandstand. Rather, we need to recenter this conversation around our obligation to provide all students with a safe learning environment. In particular, as Members of Congress, we must examine the issues of antisemitism and all other forms of animus on campus. This includes respecting the need for a safe environment to learn, and the importance of the First Amendment. Finally, while I appreciate my colleague's newfound concerns, for some students Civil Rights on campus, I would note that it is at odds with House republican's budget proposals. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot call for action, and then reduce funding for the very agency charged with protecting students' Civil Rights. In conclusion, I hope this discussion today is more thoughtful and deliberate, and respectful of the complex Constitutional question before us, even though the same opportunity was not afforded to democrats when we requested it after the racist UVA rally 7 years ago. Thank you, Madam Chair, and I yield back.   Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you, Mr. Scott. I appreciate the Ranking Member's deeply held concern about racial and other forms of discrimination. I share his abhorrence of such discrimination and white supremacist beliefs in particular. As I said in 2017, ``The violence and bigotry displayed in Charlottesville remain an afront to our shared American values. I strongly condemn these acts of hate.'' It is unfortunate that referencing the tragedy in Charlottesville has become a repeated talking point at Committee events, intended to address the wave of antisemitism occurring nationwide today. The episode to which Congressman Scott refers was not organized, or attended by university students, but was instead held by a group of white supremacists who trespassed at the university. There was no cause or jurisdiction for the Committee to open a broad investigation, or one into the University of Virginia for an event its students did not attend that the University did not approve, and that was appropriately responded to by the University. There was also no pattern of such events on campuses across the Nation to address. In contrast, at Columbia and numerous other schools, there has been a pattern of unapproved antisemitic events organized and attended by university students and staff that have denied Jewish students their right to a safe learning environment, and a failure by university administrators to respond appropriately to that denial. We will appropriately return our focus to that current crisis.  Chairwoman Foxx. Pursuant to Committee Rule 8C, all members who wish to insert written statements into the record may do so by submitting them to the Committee Clerk electronically in Microsoft Word format by 5 p.m., 14 days after the date of this hearing, which is May 1, 2024. Without objection, the hearing record will remain open for 14 days to allow such statements and other extraneous material referenced during the hearing to be submitted for the official hearing record. I now turn to the introduction of our witnesses. Our first witness is Dr. Minouche Shafik, who is President of Columbia University in New York, New York. Our second witness is Professor David Schizer, who is Co-Chair of the Task Force on Antisemitism at Columbia University in New York, New York, and served as Dean of the Law School from 2004 to 2014. Our next witness is Ms. Claire Shipman, who is Co-Chair of the Board of Trustees at Columbia University. Our final witness is Mr. David Greenwald, who is also Co-Chair of the Board of Trustees at Columbia University in New York. We thank you all for being here today, and look forward to your testimony. I want to remind the witnesses we have read your written statements, which will appear in full in the hearing record. Pursuant to Committee Rule 8-D and Committee practice, I ask that you each limit your oral presentation to a 5-minute summary of your written statement. I also remind the witnesses to be aware of their responsibility to provide accurate information to the Committee. I will first recognize Dr. Shafik for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF DR. NEMAT ``MINOUCHE'' SHAFIK, PRESIDENT, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, NEW YORK, NEW YORK Dr. Shafik. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman Foxx, Ranking Member Scott and members of the Committee. My name is Minouche Shafik, and I am the 20th President of Columbia University. Let me start by saying that Columbia strives to be a community free of discrimination and hate in all its forms. We condemn the antisemitism that is so pervasive today. Antisemitism has no place on our campus, and I am personally committed to doing everything I can to confront it directly. My approach to these issues is informed in part by my own experiences. I was born in Alexandria, Egypt, but after losing everything during the Revolution, my family came to the United States when I was just 4 years old. We lived in Georgia, Florida and North Carolina. I was the product of the desegregation era, and was bussed to many public schools and witnessed firsthand many aspects of discrimination. After attending the University of Massachusetts and the London School of Economics where I later became President, I received a scholarship to attend Oxford University where I did a Doctorate in economics. For most of my career I have worked in international organizations, where people from all nationalities, religions and backgrounds worked side by side to solve the world's problems. I wanted to bring that 25-year track record of leading and improving large, complex and diverse organizations to a great university like Columbia. On October 7th the world changed, and so did my focus. Israel was brutally attacked by Hamas terrorists, and very soon it became clear that these horrific events would ignite fear and anguish across our campus. For thousands of our Jewish and Israeli students, the catastrophe was deeply personal. Many knew people that had been killed or taken hostage in the attack. For many other Columbia students, the war in Gaza also had profound personal implications. Also, was part of a larger story of Palestinian displacement, as well as a humanitarian catastrophe. Trying to reconcile the free speech rights of those who wanted to protest, and the rights of Jewish students to be in an environment free of discrimination and harassment has been the central challenge on our campus, and numerous others across the country. Regrettably, the events of October 7th brought to the floor an uncurrent of antisemitism that is a major challenge, and like many other universities, Columbia has seen a rise in antisemitic incidents. We took immediate action after October 7th. We contacted those directly affected to provide them support, both in the region and in New York. I attended a vigil for the victims on October 9th. We held daily meetings of our Campus Security Committee, we brought in extra security expertise, and had regular contact with NYPD and the FBI. I have spent most of my time since becoming President on these issues, holding over 200 meetings with groups of students, faculty, alumni, donors, parents, some of whom are here, and 20 meetings with other university Presidents to learn with each other. That work has been done alongside my excellent colleagues at Columbia, and with the active engagement of our Trustees, including my CoChairs who are with me today. Our actions included support for students, enhanced reporting channels for incidents, hiring additional staff to investigate complaints, developing new policies on demonstrations, holding listening forums to model respectful behaviors, launching educational programs, and forming a task force of our senior academic leaders to propose solutions to antisemitism. From the start, I have held on to four principles. First, safety is paramount, and we would do whatever is necessary to ensure the safety of our campus. Because of those efforts, the vast majority of our demonstrations have been peaceful. Second, we would demonstrate care and compassion equally to everyone. Third, we must uphold freedom of speech because it is essential to our academic mission, but we cannot and should not tolerate abuse of this privilege to harass and discriminate. Fourth, the ultimate answer to antisemitism in all its forms is education, and we should not lose sight of the powerful impact of our core mission. Will it work? There have been periods in history when antisemitism is in abeyance, and they were characterized by enlightened leadership, inclusive cultures and clarity about rights and obligations. Those are the values I cherish, and that I am determined to bring to Columbia. I know together we will emerge as a stronger community as a result. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your questions.   Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you. I now recognize Professor Schizer for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF PROFESSOR DAVID SCHIZER, DEAN EMER- ITUS AND HARVEY R. MILLER PROFESSOR OF LAW & ECO- NOMICS, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, NEW YORK, NEW YORK Mr. Schizer. Thank you, Chairwoman Foxx, and thank you Ranking Member Scott for inviting me to testify today. In the wake of Hamas's barbaric atrocities on October 7th, there has been a chilling surge in antisemitism across the globe, and unfortunately at Columbia as well. President Shafik asked me to serve as a Co-Chair of a new task force on antisemitism. I am here today to share the task force's initial findings and recommendations. There is a lot to do, and we are not yet where we need to be, but we are making real progress. Before I get into the details, I will explain why the task force's work is so important to me personally. One reason is obvious, Columbia is my home. I have been on the faculty for 26 years, including 10 years as Dean of the Law School. I have also devoted years of my life to combatting antisemitism, including as CEO of a Jewish humanitarian organization called the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. I also have another personal reason to ensure that Columbia provides a welcoming environment for Jews and everyone else, which is grounded in my family history. My grandfather grew up in Ukraine. His grandfather was lynched in a pogrom. A few years later he almost met the same fate. A group of antisemitic thugs put my grandfather up against a wall, and were about to shoot him, but he managed to get away. Thankfully, he was able to come to America. He taught himself English in the public library, and eventually he enrolled at Columbia Teacher's College and that changed his life. He became a Judaic studies teacher in a Hebrew school. His son became a lawyer, and his son became a layer, and that's who's here before you today. Columbia is not just my professional home; Columbia is my cause. I am inspired by what the University has done for my family, and for so many families from diverse backgrounds across the globe. It is critical to preserve that proud tradition. The work of our antisemitism task force has not been easy. In the past 6 months we have heard too many heartbreaking stories. For example, one of my students who wears a kippah, was approached in the law school's lobby by a student who said, ``F the Jews.'' Another was spat upon at a protest. A student wearing a shirt with an Israeli flag was pinned against a wall by a protestor and told to, ``Keep on F'ing running'' when he broke free. When I heard this my first thought was of my grandfather being pushed up against a wall in Ukraine. This is simply unacceptable. It is also heartbreaking that many Jewish and Israeli students feel uncomfortable in student groups having nothing to do with the Middle East. Being a Zionist should not disqualify anyone from a dance group, or a theater production. This sort of pressure, signaling that Jews are accepted only if they reject a core part of their religion and identity, well it sounds like old-fashioned bigotry to me, and again, this is simply unacceptable. Although there are problems at Columbia, many capable and dedicated people are working hard to address them. Our task force has been in close touch with President Shafik, her leadership team, the Board, as well as faculty, staff, students, graduates and parents from across the university. Our task force began with a report last month on the rules governing protest. We offered four main recommendations, and the university is implementing all of them. First, protests should be allowed only in designated locations, not in academic buildings. Protected speech is essential, but it can't get in the way of other people's rights to speak. Second, the University needs to be more effective at enforcing its rules, so we suggested improvements. Third, a few years ago the University launched a major initiative to combat gender-based misconduct. We need a comparable effort for antisemitism. Fourth, the University needs to avoid double standards. When Jewish students complain that speech makes them uncomfortable, they should get the same treatment as other groups. We plan to issue another report in May, drawing on over 20 listening sessions with students, to describe student encounters with antisemitism, discuss definitions of antisemitism, and recommend changes in orientation, student services and student groups. We will issue more reports next year as well. In all of this work we are mindful of the University's solemn responsibility to teach the next generation, so they think critically, seek knowledge, cherish and defend liberty, and build a better world. We may disagree, even passionately, but we are at our best when we State our positions with civility. This shows not only skill as an advocate, but also human decency, respect for shared values, and respect for each other. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.   Chairwoman Foxx. Ms. Shipman, you are recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF MS. CLAIRE SHIPMAN, BOARD OF TRUSTEE CO-CHAIR, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, NEW YORK, NEW YORK Ms. Shipman. Chairwoman Foxx, Ranking Member Scott, members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to be here today, and to discuss Columbia's efforts to combat antisemitism. Antisemitism is dangerous and reprehensible. It has no place at Columbia or in our society, and I am grateful as a citizen, and as Co-Chair of our Board for the spotlight you are putting on this ancient hatred, and the critical role you all play in holding our most important institutions accountable. As a reporter, I always have a bias toward transparency and accountability. It is difficult and heartbreaking to hear, as we do regularly, that members of our community like these brave students who are here today, feel unsafe. I am the parent of college aged children. I know dozens of students at Columbia, and I feel this current climate on our campus viscerally. It is unacceptable. I can tell you plainly that I am not satisfied with where Columbia is at the moment. As Co-Chair of the Board I bear responsibility for that. This role is one of the great privileges of my life, and I take the weight of its responsibility seriously. I am dedicated to addressing these concerns. The days immediately following October 7th are the most painful I have experienced on our campus. I knew as word of the horrific Hamas terror attack started to spread, that this terrorist tragedy would have a devastating impact, especially on our Jewish students. Two days later, President Shafik and I joined hundreds of members of our community for a somber, candlelight vigil on the steps of Low Library. The grief was intense. It was a moment of comfort, but that moment would be fleeting. The last 6 months on our campus have served as an extreme pressure test. Our systems clearly have not been equipped to manage the unfolding situation, but with each challenge we have moved to adapt physical safety as President Shafik said was and is paramount. We were seeing protests of an unprecedented type and scale, levels of threats and harassment especially directed at our Jewish students that was unacceptable. We shut our gates. We backed the critical decision to bring the New York City Police Department on to our campus during demonstrations for the first time in 50 years. We have also brought on other law enforcement experts, rewritten our rules, beefed up our enforcement process. We have suspended two student groups for noncompliance, more than a dozen individual students, and we disciplined faculty members. We have also created a heavily respected, independent, antisemitism task force, as you've heard, and launched training across the university on antisemitism. I hope to be able to talk about more of our efforts later but let me say something equally important. We are far from done. I am outraged by the vile sentiments I continue to hear by those who ignore our rules, and we are holding them accountable. This problem though goes deeper than discipline. It is about returning to our core values, as an institution. Late last fall I moderated a powerful event with two brilliant women. Our Israeli Dean of our Foreign Policy School, and her friend, the Palestinian Dean of Princeton's Foreign Policy School. They did not agree on everything, but the women spoke with empathy, wisdom, common sense, and respect. That should be our steady State. Forty years ago, I arrived in New York from Columbus, Ohio, a financial aid student with little sense about the school, about the city, or even the world. I was challenged by the breadth of ideas and outlooks. I drank up the chance to rub shoulders with cutting edge DNA researchers, frontline cold war strategists who changed my political point of view. Columbia changed my life. That is what universities are meant to do, to teach students how to think, not what to think. To challenge and broaden and definitely not to intimidate and terrorize. We can be a campus that battles both antisemitism and all bigotry, and also be a place that allows for vigorous debate. A place that can weigh the most difficult questions in the world in a civilized, respectful fashion. We are determined to create again a flourishing eco-system. A healthy Columbia as we rebuild, must start with common sense and common decency with respect for each other, and our rules. We all here are committed to being honest about where we are, and doing the hard work, and I can tell you we will not stop until we get it right. I look forward today to getting your input. Thank you.   Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you. I now recognize Mr. Greenwald for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF MR. DAVID GREENWALD, BOARD OF TRUST- EES CO-CHAIR, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, NEW YORK, NEW YORK Mr. Greenwald. Chairwoman Foxx, Ranking Member Scott and members of the Committee. Thank you for this opportunity to discuss how Columbia University is fighting this surge on antisemitism on our campuses since the revolting and horrific Hamas terrorist attack on October 7th. We recognize this hearing is part of a broader effort by the Committee to combat antisemitism and bigotry on college campuses. We stand ready to assist the Committee. In recent years antisemitism has been on the rise across the world, throughout the United States and on university campuses. This disturbing trend was starkly brought to the forefront on October 7th. We agree with the Committee, it is essential that we take on this fight. Let me make clear from the outset, any targeting of Jews for hate, harassment, violence, intimidation, discrimination or exclusion is antisemitic and unacceptable at Columbia. The University's leadership, including the Board of Trustees and President Shafik, are committed to stopping these incidents, and standing with the Jewish community. We know this work is not complete. I have been Co-Chair of the Board of Trustees, together with Claire. Chairwoman Foxx. Mr. Greenwald, we have been asked to have you pull your mic closer to you please. Thank you. Mr. Greenwald. Okay. Is that better? Okay thank you. For 40 years since graduating from Columbia Law School, I practice in New York and London, until retiring as Chairman of the Fried Frank firm in February of this year. My wife, Beth, is in the audience today, demonstrating the love and support she has shown me for 40 years. I am a Jewish American. I have been subjected to antisemitism. Beth and I are active in the Jewish community. In 2017, I proudly accepted the American Jewish Community's Learned Hand Award. The AJC works to combat antisemitism and bigotry in all forms. I mention my background only to make clear that I come to these issues with personal experience. There was corrosive and unacceptable fear at Columbia following the barbaric terrorist attacks by Hamas on Israeli citizens, women, children, and babies. A professor glorified the attacks. A group of faculty penned a letter saying that the terrorist attacks were legitimate military actions. There were protests on campus in which protestors shouted, ``From the river to the sea,'' and held banners saying things like ``whatever it takes''. Many Jews herein see that as a call to eliminate Israel and Jews everywhere. As a result, many Jewish students and other members of our Columbia community did not feel safe. By their very nature, universities are places for lively debate and disagreement, but those debates must be respectful, peaceful, and collegial. When those debates devolve into antisemitic harassment, discrimination, or violence, as has unacceptably happened at Columbia after October 7th, there must be consequences. Since October 7th the Board of Trustees and the University, including the four members of this panel, have taken many steps to combat antisemitism on our campuses, and to ensure the safety of the Columbian community. I set out in detail some of these steps in my written testimony. I will mention only a few here. At the Trustee level, we quickly formed our own task force with a view toward overseeing the actions of our leadership, and developing ideas for addressing antisemitism. Two student groups have been suspended. We engaged the FBI in response to a vile and shocking, unauthorized event that took place in a university residence last month. Ten students were suspended from the University in connection with that despicable event. Consistent with principles of free speech, protests on campus have been restricted to locations consistent with our commitment to a safe and inclusive community. Action has been taken against multiple faculty members, and numerous addition faculty members are under investigation. Columbia has implemented at least 90 disciplinary measures against students, if necessary, additional actions of this nature will be taken to combat antisemitism and to promote the safety of the members of our community. Thank you again for the opportunity to discuss a topic of critical importance to me, to Columbia, and more broadly to our Nation. Eliminating antisemitism takes unrelenting and aggressive effort. Columbia is committed to making those efforts to address this ancient scourge. I welcome your questions and advice.   Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you very much. Under Committee Rule 9, we will now question witnesses under the Five-Minute Rule. I remind members that I will enforce the Five-Minute Rule strictly. You are advised to keep your questions succinct, so the witnesses have time to answer. I will begin the questioning. Dr. Shafik, you described the April 4, ``All Out for Al- Shifa'' event that took place at Columbia's campus as an, ``Unapproved event near academic buildings in violation of our rules and policies.'' You promised that participants would ``face discipline''. Your university policy requires disciplinary action to be initiated shortly after an incident occurs. According to records provided by Columbia to the Committee, the school identified at least 32 participants at the event, and sent out ``interim warning letters,'' to them to ``remind you of Columbia's policies.'' Is that what you meant by facing discipline? Dr. Shafik. Chairwoman, I want to confirm that yes, we did. We did send warning letters. We developed in consultation with our antisemitism task force a new demonstration policy, which clarified what would happen to students who attended unsanctioned events, and that policy that we also worked with our faculty and students on, has a hierarchy of punishments. Anyone who attends an unsanctioned event is immediately sent a warning letter, and if it's as an immediate action. If other sorts of misconduct occur at such an event, there could be further sanctions. Chairwoman Foxx. Let me followup on that then. If sending warning letters is discipline, has Columbia sent up warning letters following the dozens of other unapproved events that have occurred since October 7th., Dr. Shafik. Since we have had this policy in place since we have had this new policy in place, yes, I would confirm that we have sent, and those letters were sent out immediately. Those letters, if there had been repeat offenses, stay permanently on the record of those students for the rest of their time at Columbia. Of course, if other misconduct occurs, it can lead to suspension and in extreme cases, expulsion. Chairwoman Foxx. Well, how can we be confident that you will restore order and a safe learning environment if it took you months to send warning letters? Dr. Shafik. Chairwoman, I want to reassure you I have absolutely no hesitation in enforcing our policies. When I first started at Columbia our policies, our systems, and our enforcement mechanisms were not up to the scale of this challenge. Chairwoman Foxx. Okay. Dr. Shafik. They were designed for a very different world. They were designed for a student cheating on an exam. Chairwoman Foxx. Well, let us go to April 4th, when you did have policies in effect. The day before the April 4th rally, a Columbia University apartheid divest substack post warned participants to wear masks, cover any identifying features, and not swipe their Columbia IDs to evade accountability for disciplinary violations. What discipline has Columbia imposed to address the group's leaders, instructing students how to break the rules because you can tell by their being on the substack who they are? Dr. Shafik. I think one of the most effective things that we have done since the start, since October 7th is that when we know that events will happen, we have moved toward requiring Columbia University IDs to access our campus. That has prevented outside forces to come and cause trouble, and I think that is a very important reason why most of our demonstrations, in fact, the vast majority have been safe. Chairwoman Foxx. One of those organizers and speaker at this unapproved Pro Hamas rally was a student already suspended for hosting an affiliate of a terrorist organization. Do you agree that this continued defiance further aggravates the severity of the violations by the suspended student, as well as the group organizing the event? The students do not seem to be afraid of your letters. Dr. Shafik. Chairwoman, I assure you the students are not getting letters, as has previously been said we have already suspended 15 students from Columbia. We have six on disciplinary probation. These are more disciplinary actions that have been taken, than probably in the last decade in Columbia. I promise you that from the messages that I am hearing from students they are getting the message that violations will impose these kinds of consequences. Chairwoman Foxx. Well, thank you. Mr. Greenwald, the Trustees at Columbia are ultimately responsible for Columbia's governance. All of us have seen the true nature of Columbia exposed. Can you honestly say that you and the Board fulfilled the trust placed in you to maintain the good character of Columbia when you see the repeated screams of hate on your campus? Mr. Greenwald. The antisemitism on our campus makes me sick to my stomach. We are taking steps to address it. Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you. I now recognize Ms. Bonamici for 5 minutes. Ms. Bonamici. Thank you so much to the witnesses for being here today. I condemn in the strongest possible terms antisemitism on college campuses, or anywhere. It is my sincere hope that this Committee will work together on real and tangible solutions to address it. We should be hearing from experts who can help the Committee determine what the response should be to an increase in antisemitism, as well as Islamophobia, racial hostility, and other forms of discrimination and hate speech. Whether there are sufficient resources and tools under Title 6 of the Civil Rights Act to keep up with this increase. It is also my hope that members of this Committee not continue to exploit this real and very concerning challenge to further political goals or narratives. To begin, I would like to clarify something with a simple yes or no question for all of the witnesses. Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Columbia's Code of Conduct? Mr. Greenwald. Mr. Greenwald. Yes it does. Ms. Bonamici. Ms. Shipman. Ms. Shipman. Yes it does. Ms. Bonamici. Dr. Shafik. Dr. Shafik. Yes it does. Ms. Bonamici. Professor Schizer. Mr. Schizer. Yes it does. Ms. Bonamici. Thank you. Then my next question is for Dr. Shafik, and then I will have a question for Professor Schizer. Dr. Shafik, as President of Columbia, what is it like when you hear chants like, ``By Any Means Necessary,'' or ``Intifada Revolution?'' Do these chants violate Columbia's rules? Dr. Shafik. I find those chants, incredibly distressing, and I wish profoundly that people would not use them on our campus. I wish that even more after the many, many conversations that I have had with our Jewish students when they tell me how they feel when they hear those words. They find it threatening, they find it frightening, and it is abhorrent and has no place in our community. I think one of the issues that we are actively debating now, and which David Schizer, I hope is part of the antisemitism task force will help us find solutions as you have asked for, Congresswoman, is to actually clarify where language crosses the line from protected speech to discriminatory or harassing speech. We have already sent a message to our community when all 17 Deans of Columbia University in a historic message, which has never been done before said that we need to be sensitive about language, and some of those expressions that you have said ``River to the Sea Intifada,'' are incredibly hurtful, and we need to be as a community be aware that that language is hurtful. We have already sent a strong signal. I think one of the excellent recommendations of our antisemitism task force is that they have said that if you are going to chant, it should only be in a certain place, so people who do not want to hear it are protected from having to hear it. Ms. Bonamici. I do want time to followup with Professor Schizer. Thank you. Professor Schizer, my husband's grandfather also survived pogrom, and so that means a lot to my family as well. You heard Dr. Shafik's answer. We know that you are one of the Coleaders of Dr. Shafik's antisemitism task force, as well as the former Law School Dean. Will you please explain the First Amendment considerations behind Columbia's policies? Mr. Schizer. The chants we are hearing, some of them are absolutely repugnant and offensive, and let us be honest about that. As we approach what to do we have to remember three principles, and the first is free speech matters, protected speech. We do not want to suppress points of view. The second point is we do not just have free speech, we have free speech responsibilities. The fact that I can speak does not mean, Congresswoman, that I can shout you down, and prevent the students from hearing you. Third, free speech does not extend to harassment and discrimination. What we need to do is we need to make sure that our students are protected from harassment and discrimination, even as we protect speech. Ms. Bonamici. On your work on the task force, are you convinced that that will address that need? Mr. Schizer. These are very difficult issues, but I am convinced that we are working closely with the University, and we will get the job done. Ms. Bonamici. Thank you, and I will yield back the balance of my time. Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you very much. Mr. Wilson, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Wilson. Thank you, Madam Chair, and I would like to thank each of you for being here. The name Columbia is very important to me. I represent Columbia, South Carolina, with the Mayor Daniel Rickenmann, and my wife Roxanne is a graduate of Columbia College in Columbia, South Carolina. Please keep the name positive. Aside from that I am also very grateful that I grew up in the holy city of Charleston, South Carolina, and so I grew up with an appreciation of people of Jewish heritage. At the time, the American Revolution the largest Jewish population in the New World was in Charleston, South Carolina. The first Provincial Constitution to recognize Judaism as a religion was South Carolina. The first Jewish American elected official in the New World was in the Provincial Assembly. Sadly, the first Jewish American killed in the Revolution was in Charleston, South Carolina. That is the environment I grew up in, and that is why I just cannot believe the environment we are in today. It has just got to be addressed. The barbaric mass murder of October 7th by Iranian puppets of Hamas invading Israel has shockingly revealed that many college campuses are sickeningly antisemitic, and time and time again by defending the maniacal Hamas agenda. The agenda needs to be known. They have published it, and it is the Hamas covenant of August 18, 1988, and Article 7 makes clear to chase every Jew behind a rock and a tree until you find the last Jew and kill him behind the rock. This is not an accident. Additionally, we need to identify too Hamas is a puppet of Iran, as is Hezbollah, who on January 28th killed three young American Army Reservists. This should not be forgotten, the type of people we are dealing with. College campuses have descended from the coveted citadels of intellectual freedom to illiberal arenas of intolerance and bigotry, full of close-minded intolerants protected by left wing academia. All Americans in good faith want college education to be meaningful for students to achieve the American dream, free from harassment, intimidation and destructive and mindless indoctrination. I particularly support diversity of intellectual, ideology. It should be when we talk about diversity, good gosh, it should be ideological too, not mandated on soviet style education. I wrote a column for the Washington Times op-ed December 7th of last year, explaining my concern about antisemitism. President Shafik, there are dozens of antisemitic incidents documented in the Committee's February 12th document request letter, legal complaints by students and student videos. Sadly, the documents Columbia produced to the committee shows the University only suspended three students for antisemitic incidents between October 7th and March 24th, with the resistance 101 event. All three of those were lifted or reduced to adjudication. What standard does Columbia use to decide the antisemitic conduct rises to the level of what you have identified as suppression? Dr. Shafik. Thank you very much, and I wanted to say I share your deep concern about antisemitism, and your concern about diversity of thought, which is something that is very important to me in my role as President of Columbia. I think the fundamental issue, and I think this is something the Anti- Defamation League has said in its own work, the ultimate solution to fighting this horrible form of bigotry is education, and that is a huge focus for us at Columbia. We are changing the way we do education for our incoming students to make sure that they are educated about antisemitism, and we are also looking at expanding our academic offer. We already have about 50 courses at Columbia on Israel, on Jewish studies on the Middle East, and we need to expand that in order to ultimately deal with this horrible problem. Mr. Wilson. Well, we would support every effort. Then hey, I want to express concern too, and that is the Columbia School of Social Work has a glossary, which identifies capitalism as a system of economic oppression. I hope that your academics visit Pyongyang. I am one with former Congressman Eliot Engel. I have been to Pyongyang. I have seen the benefits of socialism and communism. They have reduced what was the wealthiest part of Korea into the poorest with a per capital income of $867.00. South Korea, capitalist South Korea $44,000.00. The thought of saying that capitalism is suppressive is so insulting, and stupid, and historically incorrect, and communism, socialism, fascism do not work, capitalism does, that is why America is the most successful country on earth. I yield back. Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you, Mr. Wilson. Mr. Takano, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Takano. Thank you, Madam Chair. I strongly condemn antisemitic behavior, antisemitic speech, antisemitic actions on any college campus, and likewise I condemn anti-Palestinian, or anti-Islamic or Islamophobic behavior as well. Professor Schizer, I am struck by some work survey reach done by Richard Pape with the University of Chicago's project on security threats, security and threats of higher education on the extent of campus fears and changes in antisemitism after October 7th. While his findings reveal that 56 percent of Jewish students felt in personal danger, 52 percent of Muslim college students feel also in personal danger. Most surprisingly, 16 percent of other college students felt a personal danger as a result of the campus current climate on campuses. He further concludes that, ``Different perceptions of intent are likely contributing to those fears.'' 66 percent of Jewish students understand a pro-Palestinian protests chant, ``From the River to the Sea, Palestine will be Free,'' to mean the expulsion and genocide of Israeli Jews, while only 14 percent of Muslims understand the chant that way. Dr. Pape believes the underlying fears that are not being addressed are fueling both antisemitic and anti-Islamic sentiment on campus. ``About 10 percent of college students would permit student groups to call for genocide against Jews, and about 13 percent of college students say that when Jews are attacked it is because they deserve it.'' When these same questions are asked about Muslims, we find the same percentages, 10 percent and 13 percent respectively, in particular, the findings are an opportunity to recenter the national discussion around students, and away from politics. The finding shows strong support for calming actions, such as major public statements by university and national leaders that would condemn violence of any kind against any group of people. What is your reaction to Professor Pape's research and what you have been doing with your group? Mr. Schizer. I think your question and his research highlight the importance of this hearing, and I am grateful to all of you for holding it. It is unacceptable for any students at any university to feel fear, or to feel uncomfortable because of who they are. We cannot have that in the United States of America. If you ask me are we doing enough? I say we have not yet done enough, and we are on our way, but we have a way to go. I will just emphasize two other things. First of all, we need consistency, right? What we do for Jewish students, what we do for Muslim students, we need to do for all students. Consistency is, at its core, what our country is about, and I think sometimes we are falling short there. We need to focus on that, and we need to protect everyone, while also allowing robust debate because that is the essence of the university. Mr. Takano. Professor Schizer, in your task force work to combat antisemitism, I believe you are also focused on with your statement about consistency, making sure that all students are safe, your Muslim students, your Palestinian students are safe. Is that true? Is that accurate? Mr. Schizer. Absolutely. I should say our specific mandate is antisemitism, but we hope that our recommendations and the ideas we develop with colleagues will be applicable to everyone and will be helpful to everyone. Mr. Takano. Well, I am struck by your comments, your written comments. When you say members of a group that say particular phrases, or comments that interfere with their ability to learn and work should the university defer to them? In recent years this sort of deference has been commonplace for instance when women, black and transgender students have registered concerns and discussions of sexual assault, beliefs, and transgender rights. The response has been different when Jewish students and Israeli students lodge similar complaints after October 7th. With the time remaining, can you kind of help unpack that a bit more for the Committee? Mr. Schizer. Sure. I am a conservative. I am close to many conservative students. There have been times when they have gotten a signal that they should really go slow on a particular event, or not articulate a particular position because it makes others feel uncomfortable, and it is striking how that kind of language has not been applied to Jewish students, when Jewish students have said we feel uncomfortable, the emphasis has been no, no, no, free speech. No. I want to be clear. I think free speech is essential, but I also think consistency is essential. We need to have the same approach for everyone. Mr. Takano. Thank you. My time is up. I wish I could talk to you more, but I yield back, Madam Chair. Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you, Mr. Takano. Mr. Walberg, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Walberg. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thanks to the panel for being here. The day after the October 7th attack, Professor Joseph Masad, and I only single him out amongst numerous others that I could single out, because he particularly is a tenured professor, and Chairs the School of Arts and Sciences Academic Review Committee. He wrote in an article praising, and I quote him, ``The innovative Palestinian resistance,'' for attacking Israel and glorifying Hamas's slaughter of nearly 1,200 Jews as and I quote again, ``Awesome, astonishing, astounding and incredible.'' What perverse statements, yes. A tenured professor, who has been saying these type of things for 20 years at Columbia. President Shafik, you recently said, and I quote, ``It is absolutely unacceptable for any member of the Columbia community to promote the use of terror and violence.'' Do you condemn Professor Masad's statement, and has he faced any consequences for it? Dr. Shafik. Congressman, I do condemn his statement. I am appalled by what he said. Mr. Walberg. Any consequences? Dr. Shafik. He has been spoken to. Mr. Walberg. Spoken to? Dr. Shafik. I think you could---- Mr. Walberg. The support of terrorism is acceptable if you are a Columbia professor? Dr. Shafik. Not at all. I should say---- Mr. Walberg. He has been spoken to? Dr. Shafik. I did not get to---- Mr. Walberg. I have your answer. Dr. Shafik. No. Mr. Walberg. Let me move on here. Professor Masad has also been known to have called Israelis, ``cruel and blood thirsty colonizers.'' Foreigners who join the Israel military as, ``baby killing Zionists, Jewish volunteers for Israeli Jewish supremacy.'' In 2005, an investigation by Columbia corroborated allegations that Masad yelled at a Jewish student who questioned his views to, ``get out of my classroom.'' Can you imagine free speech? Diversity on campus? Well, let us move it over. Let us intentionally disregard the feelings of the Jewish student as being less than human in this classroom, to someone like myself, who might be given this to wear to remember and bring home the hostages now to quietly take it off, so my professor would not see it. A professor who holds my academic career in the palm of his hands. Is that free speech? That is diversity? President Shafik, I am concerned that that is not happening here, so let me ask this question. As the Chair of the School of Arts and Sciences Academic Review Committee, Professor Masad is responsible for, ``overseeing the periodic review of all departments, centers and institutes in the school.'' Do you stand behind Professor Massad remaining Chair of this Academic Review Committee, given his support for terrorism and harassing Jewish students. Dr. Shafik. Congressman Walberg, I just want to confirm that when faculty behave in any discriminatory fashion at Columbia. Mr. Walberg. You talk to them? Dr. Shafik. There are consequences. No. We take them out of the classroom if necessary. Mr. Walberg. Is he out of the classroom? Dr. Shafik. We use the term leadership post if necessary. We allow students to leave those classes if they feel at all uncomfortable. Mr. Walberg. Is he out of the classroom? Dr. Shafik. He is I believe to answer your question, he is no longer a Chair of that Committee, and does not have a leadership role. Mr. Walberg. Not out of the classroom. Let me move over to the Trustees. As Trustees, would you approve Professor Masad for tenure if the decision were before you today? Ms. Shipman. I would not. Mr. Greenwald. Nor would I. Mr. Walberg. Then why is he still in the classroom? You are Trustees of this preeminent institution of diversity, of free thought, and you talk to professors who make horrific statements like this. As I said, I could have addressed other professors. You in fact, even pointed out that there were numerous professors that you are looking at right now. If they are only going to get a talking to, I am concerned. I yield back. Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you, Mr. Walberg. Dr. Adams, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. Adams. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thanks to the witnesses for being here today. Many of us here never would have imagined that we would be concerned about the safety of Jewish Americans in New York, of all places. Jewish Americans have faced some of the highest levels of antisemitic incidents since the FBI began monitoring. Antisemitic incidents at U.S. college campuses have increased in both number and intensity since October 7th, and as a former professor myself for 40 years, I will tell you on a campus that is unacceptable. 73 percent of Jewish college students have experienced or witnessed some form of antisemitism since the beginning of the school year, and only one-third of Jewish students felt safe on campuses. I think every student should feel safe on any campus that they are studying on. Mr. Schizer, let me ask you, you are Co- Chair of the Task Force on Antisemitism on your campus. How has the task force recognized the unique challenges that Columbia faces in dealing with protests and demonstrations, harassment allegations and overall threats to segments of the student population while being an urban and open campus, in one of the largest cities in the world? Mr. Schizer. It is a critical responsibility, Congresswoman, for exactly the reasons that you described. This is not an acceptable situation. I do want to say there are wonderful things happening at Columbia too, and part of what moves me is how many people have pitched in to make sure that we deal with this problem, but the problem is there, and it is not yet fixed. I will say that our first step was to look at rules for protests, and I am very grateful that our responses have been taken so seriously. As I said, the University is implementing all of our recommendations, but we are only just getting started. We have another report coming out next month. We have got to look at student orientations. We have got to look at the way we train people who deal with students. We have got to look at the policies for student groups to make sure that people don't get excluded, and then we have more reports that we have in mind for next year, including careful research to get detailed insights into the people that have been victims of this discrimination because we need to understand it, and we need to stop it. Ms. Adams. Thank you. You are expecting recommendations from this? Okay. Columbia is over 270 years old. That is almost three decades, or three centuries actually. It was not until 1873 that Columbia became an integrated institution, by allowing its first black student by the name of James R. Priest to enroll, who was also the son of a former slave. Over history, your admissions enrolled have evolved as an institution of higher education. My question to you is how do the Trustees work to ensure that Columbia remains true to its practice of progress, while making sure that it is welcoming and responsive to demographic groups that it was not originally designed to serve? Mr. Schizer. Is that for me? Ms. Adams. Yes it is. Mr. Schizer. One of the great privileges of being at a university is a diverse student body, people who come from very different backgrounds who then meet each other, learn from each other, learn with each other, and we need to be sure that that continues to happen in all the ways that universities do well. One of the challenges of the recent months is that I think we have fallen short in various ways, but the aspiration is there. Our commitment to be welcoming and also open has to apply to everyone. Ms. Adams. Thank you. Ms. Shipman, or Mr. Greenwald, would you like to respond? You have got 57 seconds. Mr. Greenwald. I agree with Professor Schizer bringing diverse people to campus with coming from different backgrounds, difference places in the country, different places from around the world. It is enriching to their educational experience. Ms. Adams. Okay. Ms. Shipman Ms. Shipman. I agree with that, Congresswoman. I would also say that fundamentally our institution has got to be about respect, and that is sorely lacking on our campus right now, and we can have diversity and different points of view, but if people are not listening, and they are weaponizing their sentiments, nobody is learning. Ms. Adams. Yes, ma'am. Well, certainly the goal should be to ensure that every member of the campus community can reach their full potential without additional burdens of stereotypes and biases, and barriers. I hope that Columbia can take, and our universities can take some steps to support students on the ground. With that, Madam Chairman, I yield back. I only have about 6 seconds. Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you, Dr. Adams. Ms. Stefanik, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. Stefanik. Thank you, Chairwoman. I want to followup on my colleague, Rep. Walberg's questions regarding Professor Joseph Masad. Let me be clear, President, that he was spoken to. Who spoke with him? Dr. Shafik. He was spoken to by his head of department and his dean. Ms. Stefanik. What was he told? Dr. Shafik. I was not in those conversations. I think he was told that language was unacceptable. Ms. Stefanik. You are not aware of what he was told. What was he told? What was he told? Dr. Shafik. That that language was unacceptable. Ms. Stefanik. Were there any other enforcement actions taken? Any other disciplinary actions taken? Dr. Shafik. In his case, he has not repeated anything like that ever since. Ms. Stefanik. Does he need to keep stating that the massacre of Israeli civilians was awesome? Does he need to repeat his participation in an unauthorized pro-Hamas demonstration on April 4th? Professor David Schizer talked about the lack of enforcement. Do you agree that this is an issue with a lack of enforcement? When the policy of Columbia, specifically stated on April 7th, April 5th said, ``I want to make clear that it is absolutely unacceptable for any member of this community to promote the use of terror or violence?'' You have no action. No disciplinary action. Do you agree with how the University has handled this? Dr. Shafik. Congresswoman, we have 4,700 faculty at Columbia. Most of whom spent all of their time dedicated to teaching their students. Ms. Stefanik. I am talking about the faculty members who are supporting terror, and it is not just that case. Let me bring your attention to Mohammad Abdou who was hired after the October 7th terrorist attack against Israel. He on October 11th, posted, ``Yes. I am with Hamas and Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad.'' He also decried false reports accusing Arabs and Muslims of decapitating the heads of children and being rapists. We know that there were decapitations of babies, of innocent Israel citizens, of seniors, of women, there were rapes, and yet Columbia hired this individual as a professor. How did that hiring process work? Were you aware of those statements before the hiring? Dr. Shafik. I share with you, your repugnance at those remarks. I completely understand that. On my watch faculty who make remarks that cross the line, in terms of antisemitism, there will be consequences for that. Ms. Stefanik. What are the consequences in this case? Dr. Shafik. I have five cases at the moment who have either been taken out of the classroom or dismissed. Ms. Stefanik. Is he one of those? Dr. Shafik. He will never work at Columbia again. Ms. Stefanik. He has been terminated? Dr. Shafik. He has been terminated. He has--not just terminated, but his files will show that he will never work at Columbia again. Ms. Stefanik. He is currently not employed by Columbia? Dr. Shafik. He is grading his students papers and will never teach at Columbia again, and that will be on his permanent record. Ms. Stefanik. How are you changing the hiring processes, because on your watch he was hired after he made these statements publicly. How are you ensuring this has not happened with your hiring process moving forward? Dr. Shafik. When we hire people obviously, they have to meet the academic qualifications, but we do an employment check and a criminal record check. We also ask everyone to do an attestation that they have never been accused of discrimination or part of an investigation around harassment or discrimination. That attestation has to be signed by all new employees. Ms. Stefanik. It did not work in this case? Dr. Shafik. I think in this case, well he may not have been subject to an investigation on discrimination or found guilty. It has to be a found guilty. Ms. Stefanik. Do you think you have a problem when the hiring process of Columbia is hiring someone who makes those statements? Dr. Shafik. I agree with you. Ms. Stefanik. Was hired after making those statements? Dr. Shafik. I agree with you that I think we need to look at how to toughen up those requirements. We do have a requirement, but I agree with you, I think we need to look at how we can make it more effective. Ms. Stefanik. Let me ask about Professor Catherine Frank from the Columbia Law School, who said that all Israelis students who have served in the IDF are dangerous and should not be on campus. What disciplinary action has been taken against that professor? Dr. Shafik. I agree with you that those comments are completely unacceptable, and discriminatory. Ms. Stefanik. I am asking you what disciplinary action has been taken? Dr. Shafik. She has been spoken to by a very senior person in the administration, and she has said that that was not what she intended to say. Ms. Stefanik. Has she publicly apologized? Dr. Shafik. I have suggested that. Ms. Stefanik. You have suggested that. Has she done that? Dr. Shafik. I think she will be finding a way to clarify her position. Ms. Stefanik. You see the concern here though with the lack of enforcement? Do you see the concern that is speaking to these professors is not enough, and it is sending a message across the university that this is tolerated, these antisemitic statements from a position of authority in professors in the classroom, is tolerated. My time has expired, but I will have multiple rounds of questions. I yield back. Chairwoman Foxx. Ms. Manning, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. Manning. Thank you, Madam Chair. Professor Shafik, I understand that all Columbia students go through an orientation that includes anti-discrimination training. Does that training include comprehensive education about antisemitism, including the central role Israel plays in Judaism? Dr. Shafik. Thank you for that question. In the past that was not the case. That is something we are actively working on. Ms. Manning. Is that taking place right now? Dr. Shafik. We have trained our student affairs staff across Columbia, but---- Ms. Manning. I think time is of the essence, and I hope you will commit to getting that training in place immediately. Dr. Shafik. Yes. It is being put in place now for our incoming class. Ms. Manning. Okay. The report issued by your task force on antisemitism says that discrimination and harassment are not protected speech. We have seen chants at Columbia calling to globalize the intifada and much worse. During the intifada, Palestinian suicide bombers blew up Israelis on city busses, at restaurants, even at weddings. In fact, Columbia alum Sarah Duker was killed in a bus bombing in Jerusalem in 1996. Given this history, are calls to globalize the intifada acceptable at Columbia? A yes or no answer please. Dr. Shafik. I personally find it unacceptable. Our current rules have not specified that as not acceptable, but we sent a very clear message to our community that that kind of language is unacceptable. Ms. Manning. I certainly hope you will rectify that in your statements. The task force report also states that antisemitism includes efforts to rationalize or endorse the murder of Jews, or the destruction of the State of Israel. I would like to submit for the record an article written by Professor Joseph Masad that rationalizes the murder of Jews, and the destruction of the State of Israel. Chairwoman Foxx. Without objection.   Ms. Manning. Why is that professor still teaching at Columbia. Dr. Shafik. As I said, we have mechanisms in place where faculty cross the line. We have done we have many cases, and when we have any complaints from students saying they feel uncomfortable there are disciplinary processes. Ms. Manning. Is he still teaching? Dr. Shafik. He is still on the faculty. Ms. Manning. Is he still teaching Dr. Shafik. I am not--I do not want to misspeak. I am not sure he is teaching at the moment. Ms. Manning. Okay. The task force report also states that the mission of a great university requires uncompromising rigor in uncovering facts and analyzing ideas. Now the article that I just asked to be submitted to the record, demonstrates that this professor has an extreme one-sided view of the longstanding conflict in the Middle East, which view Israel as illegitimate, and any attempt to destroy Israelis as legitimate. Is teaching this one-sided view of the conflict in the Middle East in line with your mission to educate your students with uncompromising rigor, and uncovering facts, and analyzing ideas? Dr. Shafik. Our objection is to give students a broad exposure to many ideas. We have about 50 courses at the moment, which cover Israeli and Jewish studies, the Middle East, and it is important that they be exposed to all of those views. Ms. Manning. No one student can take all 50 courses. Is there an effort to make sure that both sides, of course I do not agree that the murder of Jews and the destruction of Israel is a side that should be taught, but are there for example, any professors in your Middle East studies department who believe that Israel has the right to exist as a Jewish state? Dr. Shafik. In fact, the head of that department is an Israeli, and---- Ms. Manning. That does not answer my question. Dr. Shafik. We have many faculty at Columbia who clearly would take that view. I should also say that most of these courses are electives, and students can choose which professors they want to study with, but I would, you know, obviously we want them to have a broad range of views. Ms. Manning. I am worried about how we get at the underlying issue that there is such antisemitism on your college campus. Now step one is to make sure that there is rigorous antisemitism training in your antidiscrimination course that all your students are supposed to take. Step two is having that same training for your faculty members. Dr. Shafik. Yes. Ms. Manning. Step three is making sure that your Middle East studies department does not ferment antisemitism by teaching that Israel is illegitimate as a student as a State, and that Jews should be murdered to get rid of Israel. Is that a problem? Dr. Shafik. Congresswoman, I agree with you. We are in active discussions with Ted Deutch of the American Jewish Congress on the kinds of educational programs that they have developed, and we are looking at how we can integrate them. We have done some of that already with our student affairs staff, and we are working with the antisemitism task force to see how to do it for next year. Ms. Manning. I believe you have a poor curriculum at Columbia. I suggest you insert that, and I would like to close by asking that a statement by my colleague, Representative Ritchie Torres, also be entered into the record. With that, my time is expired, and I yield back. Chairwoman Foxx. Without objection, the material the gentlewoman asked to be put in the record will be placed in the record.   Chairwoman Foxx. Mr. Grothman, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Grothman. I will yield to Representative Stefanik for her questions. Ms. Stefanik. Just to followup, you should know this President Shafik, but Masad is still in fact listed on the Columbia website as Chair of the Academic Review Committee. Are you aware of that? Dr. Shafik. I would need to check that. Ms. Stefanik. It is the website; it is right here. Dr. Shafik. I do not want to misState because I---- Ms. Stefanik. He has not been removed as Chair. Dr. Shafik. I would like to confirm that. Ms. Stefanik. Do I have your commitment that he will be removed as Chair today? Dr. Shafik. I have my commitment that I will come back to you and give you the facts first. Ms. Stefanik. He has not been removed, so you said in front of Congress under oath that---- Dr. Shafik. No, no. I said I am not sure. Ms. Stefanik. You said that he was removed. Well, I will tell you what. He is still listed as Chair. Let me ask the Board of Trustees is that acceptable that he is Chair of this Committee? Should he be removed today. Ms. Shipman Ms. Shipman. Congresswoman, you have put your finger on one of the hardest issues we as Board Chairs face right now. I think you can see our systems, from the videos you have played, everything you are talking about our systems of rules and enforcement. Ms. Stefanik. Are broken. They are broken. Ms. Shipman. We have worked tirelessly to---- Ms. Stefanik. My question to you Ms. Shipman, and I am the one asking the questions here as a United States Member of Congress is do you believe that he should be removed as Chair, because currently he is listed as Chair on Columbia University's website? Ms. Shipman. I do not believe any professor at Columbia should say anything like what--our professors have to be held to a higher standard than our students, and I can tell you that our Board---- Ms. Stefanik. You cannot say at this hearing that he should be removed as Chair even though he violates University rules? Ms. Shipman. Personally, I would not want him as Chair. And we are looking at the issue of faculty and what we expect from our specialty. Ms. Stefanik. Mr. Greenwald, do you think he should be removed as Chair? Mr. Greenwald. His comments are abhorrent, and I believe that one of the steps that we could take in terms of discipline is to remove him from that leadership position. Ms. Stefanik. Thank you for that direct answer. Just to let you know, Mr. Abdou is not grading papers right now, he is on campus at the unsanctioned anti-Israel, antisemitic event that is being supported by pro-Hamas activists on campus, so that is what Professor Abdou is doing at this very moment. I will give you back your time. Mr. Grothman. Okay. A Jewish member of the school's social works faculty told the New York Times, ``When Jews speak up in our school, they are met with you have white privilege, so shut up, you are a colonizer, you are an oppressor. You are reprehensible for the deaths of innocent Palestinians.'' Do you want to comment on that? Comment on that, and how can you get this sort of rhetoric out of your faculty? Dr. Shafik. I find those remarks reprehensible. Mr. Grothman. How does this happen? That is not the question, they are obviously indefensible. What is going on here? You guys talk about diversity. How in the world does this happen? Dr. Shafik. Congressman, there are 4,700 faculty at Columbia, and most of them---- Mr. Grothman. Please speak up. Dr. Shafik. I said there are 4,700 faculty at Columbia, and most the vast majority are dedicated. Mr. Grothman. I will give you what I think the gist of the problem is. You guys talk about diversity. Could you give me a ballpark school of social work, your faculty across the board of your Law School, how many do you think are more on the republican leaning side, and how many on the democratic leaning side? Dr. Shafik. I am personally incredibly committed to diversity. I am personally, incredibly committed to viewpoint diversity, and it is one of the things that I want to bring to Columbia. I do not know the answer to that because---- Mr. Grothman. Ball Park? Dr. Shafik. We do not ask people. I honestly cannot answer that because. Mr. Grothman. How many do you--just in your own mind could you rattle off like ten republican'ish faculty out of your 4,000 off the top of your head? Dr. Shafik. Yes. I could actually, but you know, I did an event just last week with just--it was an economist, it was a democrat, and Glen Hubbard who is the republican. We have two of our Fellows from our Institute for Global Politics who are former Trump administration officials. Mr. Grothman. Let me ask another question. On December 6th the student group Columbia Social Workers for Palestine held a disruptive Pro terrorism teach in, inside the school's lobby in which they said on October 7th the Palestinian Liberation fighters demonstrated they are refusal to be dominated and called their effort a heroic struggle for liberation. Dean Melissa Begg initially canceled the event because of its advertising, but later she changed her mind and decided to have the event. Were any of these students disciplined, or what kind of message do you think that sent? Dr. Shafik. I believe some of those I believe those students were identified and they went through a disciplinary process. Mr. Grothman. According to a current student on October 10th, a request by Jewish students to the DEI office to designate a room to grieve the mass murder of Jews, something that should be per functionally agreed, can the concern about the optics, given a lack of a similar room for Palestinian students, was it inappropriate to deny Jewish students their request they should be given that room or not? Dr. Shafik. Sorry, I could not hear exactly. Denied access to the room they requested to book. Is that the question? Mr. Grothman. You have got to speak up. Dr. Shafik. Yes. I think they should have been allowed, and I believe that was corrected later. Mr. Grothman. Why do not you aim for a little more ideological diversity on campus? Chairwoman Foxx. Mr. Grothman, your time is up. Mr. Sablan, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Sablan. Thank you, Madam Chair. Welcome to the witnesses, and to everybody in this room. I have a question, well antisemitism exists. We know it is a problem. It is a major problem. Islamophobia exists. It is a major problem. All kinds of different, but you at Columbia, you know it exists, right? Any one of you. Antisemitism is a problem at your school. Yes? Mr. Schizer. Yes. Mr. Sablan. It is a problem in many other schools and in many other places in the Nation and in the world. Mr. Schizer. Yes. Mr. Sablan. At Columbia, you are all working to try as much as possible to fix this problem, right? That is what I gather from all of you today. Am I correct?  Mr. Sablan. Thank you. Now I have been here 16 years, I am not that long, but there are hearings where I ask a question, and before you give me an answer I throw in another question. Dr. Shafik, is there something you would like to say when you are so unceremoniously cutoff from giving an answer to questions you were asked by United States Members of Congress, please? Dr. Shafik. I guess what I would say is I am personally very committed to viewpoint diversity at Columbia, and I'm very personally committed to making sure that our faculty do not cross the line in terms of discrimination and harassment. We have mechanisms that are now being enforced, and on my watch, they will be enforced. I think many of these appointments were made in the past in a different era, and that era is done. Mr. Sablan. All right. Professor Schizer, do you have anything to add, sir, to what you have been asked already? Mr. Schizer. At the moment. No. Mr. Sablan. Nobody cut you off, great. Ms. Shipman, I know somebody cut you off, yes? Something to add? Ms. Shipman. These are all legitimate questions. I understand the urgency, and I appreciate that we are here. Mr. Sablan. Okay. You do not, Mr. Greenwald, sir? Mr. Greenwald. Nothing else. I am all right. Mr. Sablan. Thank you. Thank you for being here. Expecting all of these things, but I can see that you all are aware of the issue, you are working toward the issue. I do not know if what you guys figure out to do as your policy in Columbia University will be a policy we can copy and fix all the problems we have in the world. This is an ancient problem, like Ms. Shipman said. It will take time and effort to fix it, just as you know, we still have to fix women rights, human rights, you know, employee, everything. Many things, but at Columbia I am confident, I am convinced that you guys know the problem exists, and that you are trying to do something to fix it. For that, I yield the remainder of my time. Thank you. Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you, Mr. Sablan. Mr. Allen, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Allen. Thank you, Chairwoman. Well, as you can see, I think the concern is unanimous that we have all been troubled by antisemitic activities occurring at your campus and around the country, and around the world. As the oldest and most established democracy in the region of Israel exemplifies the core values of freedom and democracy. In fact, I tell my colleagues that Washington, DC. is not the center of the universe. Jerusalem is the center of the universe. In fact, I read and researched that you have an undergraduate and graduate degree school of religion at Columbia University. Is that correct? Dr. Shafik. We have affiliated institutions, union theological seminary and the Jewish theological seminary, as well as a Department of Religion at Columbia. Mr. Allen. All right. In that degree program, I did not research exactly what you teach, but are you familiar with Genesis 12:3? Dr. Shafik. Probably not as well as you are, Congressman. Mr. Allen. Well, it is pretty clear. It was a covenant that God made with Abraham and that covenant was real clear. If you bless Israel, I will bless you. If you curse Israel, I will curse you. Then in the New Testament it was confirmed that all nations would be blessed through you. You did not know about that? Dr. Shafik. I have heard that now that you have explained it, yes. I have heard that before. Mr. Allen. Okay. It sounds familiar. Do you consider that a serious issue? I mean do you want Columbia University to be cursed by God of the Bible? Dr. Shafik. Definitely not. Mr. Allen. Okay. Well, that is good. Here is the deal. We got freedom of speech in this country, and freedom of religion, yet we also have Moses looking down on an entire body of Congress who gave us the law, which most of our laws were made and are supposed to be enforced, came from the original law. What we have today is a lawless land. We have lawless universities that are overrun by people who are threatening to kill other students, who are attacking other students, and creating fear in this country? We have a constitution that requires us to treat other folks as we would like to be treated, which is also in the New Testament? I mean maybe you should have a course, and you know, you do not have to believe it, but you know, the Bible is an incredible book. There is a lot of history there, and you do not have to believe it, but you need to know what is in there. Maybe you should have a course suggested for those who are having problems with all of this on the Bible, and what is in the Bible, and kind of what will happen if, you know, under the wrath of God. I mean we have above the American Flag in our Chamber, in God We Trust. I mean what God is that? Do you understand why we are here? This is a serious issue. Would any of the other Board care to--what do you know about this issue, and how do you feel about it? I mean what are your feelings on what young people are being indoctrinated by these professors to believe this stuff, and they have no idea that they are going to be cursed by God. The God of the Bible, and the God over our flag. What are your thoughts? Ms. Shipman. Congressman, my thoughts are that you are right that we have a moral crisis on our campus, and I find as I have said, you are probably tired of hearing it. I find the behavior of some of our students, some of our faculty, unacceptable, and I think we have a variety of tools to deal with that we have to be able to have rules that make sense. We have to be able to enforce them because people learn from consequences. We have to have order. Then we need deep antisemitism training as we heard the Congresswoman talk, this is essential. We must train people on what this is, and finally I think we need education. Mr. Allen. Well, I am just about out of time, but you need to know that also, you know, education is important. Knowledge is important, but the beginning of wisdom is the fear of God. I yield back. Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you, Mr. Allen. Ms. Stevens, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. Stevens. Dr. Shafik, is it safe to say that 99 percent of your students are over the age of 18? Do you happen to know how many are under the age of 18? Dr. Shafik. Yes. That is safe to say. Ms. Stevens. We have got the undergrads, we have got the graduates, we have adult students, and I am in the minority party, so we did not have a ton of say in who was participating in today's hearing. We have had several hearings about rising antisemitism and abhorrent antisemitism, and I see that there are students in this audience, and there are students outside this Committee room. Your voices are entirely important here. Your lived experience is very important. I certainly have the where were you on 10/7 moment. I was with Jewish constituents at home when I was seeing this war unfold, and the horrors unfolded. My immediate thought was oh dear, our college campuses are going to erupt. I have been a Member of Congress who has been very dedicated to the Jewish student experience, and the protection of it, and we are throughout this country tragically and alarmingly at a boiling point as it pertains to antisemitism on college campuses. To every single person in this room wearing the kippah, who is a Jewish student, who stands alongside Israel, and fellow Jewish Americans, you belong. You have a safe space here in the Congress, and you deserve to have a safe space on your campus. I personally had no thought of every applying to Columbia, or any of these other fancy universities that were coming to our committee to talk about what is going on, but I think we would be having a much better hearing if we had students here. I had the privilege of talking to a Columbia Jewish student just yesterday, and what he shared with me was unbelievable. I do not know what is going on with you all in the administration, frankly you have a D report card from the ADL. I hear you, that you say these things are terrible, and yet they are happening. The message to the students, and I was an antiwar protestor in college myself. I was there when we went into Iraq. I did not want to see us do that, but you cannot call out war while calling out the death and destruction of another group of people. You cannot do that. Protests and events, they get unwieldly. I am an elected official. I have town halls and all this and that, and we understand what happens. Let us be really clear here about human dignity and where we are going. We have a vote that we are taking in the next day or two, a resolution on condemning Iran's attacks on Israel. Again, it is from the majority party. I would like to, as a Congress, be having more nuanced conversations and protections. I come from a very diverse beautiful place in this country, and I listen, and I hear from all of my constituents all over. Where and how are we going to stand up if we're against war, and we are against death and destruction here as a Congress, we have got to take responsible votes. To the students, I think that is how I want to use my time. I want to see Columbia and all these other places that are failing on their ADL report card to improve. We have got to improve. We have got a responsibility to improve. We are doing it in the Congress. We employ young people here. We have interns here. I yield back. Thank you. Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you, Ms. Stevens. Mr. Banks, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Banks. President Shafik, I understand you are very proud of the Columbia University School of Socal Work, right? Dr. Shafik. Yes. It is the oldest social work school in the country. Mr. Banks. Yes. Can you define for us the word Ashkenormativity? Dr. Shafik. I am not familiar with that term. I believe it appeared in a student glossary that was prepared by a group of students. Mr. Banks. It appears in the orientation guidebook that is given to all of the students at the School of Social Work, but you cannot define it for us? Dr. Shafik. No. I am saying I am not---- Mr. Banks. You seem to be familiar? Dr. Shafik. I do not use that term. I do not know that term. I believe that glossary was prepared by students for other students. I do not think it is a part of---- Mr. Banks. You agree, it is handed out to all of the students who are at the orientation. I mean that is what it is. It is the orientation glossary of terms for incoming students at the School of Social Work, so---- Dr. Shafik. I do not think it is a product of the School of Social Work. I think a group of students put this together. Mr. Banks. It is handed out to students at the School of Social Work. Let me read to you how Ashkenormativity is defined by your--you do not know if it comes from students, or professors? Dr. Shafik. It comes from students. Mr. Banks. At your school, but Ashkenormativity is defined as a system of oppression that favors white Jewish folks based on the assumption that all Jewish folks are Ashkenazi, or from Western Europe. Do you have a response to that definition of Ashkenormativity? Is that appropriate? This is handed out to your students. Dr. Shafik. By other students. It is not a product of the faculty of Columbia University. Mr. Banks. It is handed out to your students. Obviously, you allow this to be handed out to your students. Is that appropriate? Dr. Shafik. As I said, this is not a product of the faculty, of the administration. It is something that a group of students produced. I do not agree with it. I think it is not very useful. I do not condone it. Mr. Banks. Okay. Can you help me understand something else? I did not go to an Ivy League school admittedly. Can you explain why the word ``folks'' is spelled F-O-L-X throughout this guidebook, and in other places at the School of Social Work? What does that mean? A serious question. Dr. Shafik. They do not know how to spell. I mean I am not familiar with that spelling. Mr. Banks. I do not find it a laughing matter. Dr. Shafik. No. I am not laughing either. I think it is--I really do---- Mr. Banks. You are denying that this is an official product of the school, but this is handed out to all of your--you are aware that it is handed out to all of your students, and you are not doing anything to stop it. Dr. Shafik. As I said, it is not an official product of the administration. Mr. Banks. Is this how Columbia University spells the word folks? Dr. Shafik. No. Mr. Banks. Okay. Does Columbia University recognize the word, because it is not found in the Webster's dictionary, or anywhere else, Ashkenormativity. Is that an acceptable term at Columbia University? Ms. Shafik. Congressman, I am with you. I agree with you that I do not find this a meaningful way of---- Mr. Banks. This is handed out on your watch. Dr. Shafik. As I said, this is not a product of Columbia University. Mr. Banks. To the Board of Trustees. Is this appropriate? Either one of you? Mr. Greenwald. That term is shockingly offensive, Congressman. Mr. Banks. Ma'am? Ms. Shipman. We had discussions about that memo on the Board, and my understanding is that we have asked that anything that is looking as though it is orientation materials in any way, be run by the Dean, and I think that is the agreement. As President Shafik has said, we are not going to be able to limit what individual students say to each other. We do not like it. It is not the kind of learning we promote at Columbia, obviously. Mr. Banks. You understand how this fosters an environment of antisemitism when the President even admits that she doesn't know if this is an official document of the school, or written by students, but it's still allowed to be handed out to your students. Ms. Shipman. It is outrageous. Mr. Banks. It fosters--it is the reason that we hold this hearing. It fosters an environment of antisemitism at your university. President, are you going to stop this from being handed out again to incoming students at the orientation of the School of Social Work? Dr. Shafik. We will make sure that it is not part of any of orientation process. Mr. Banks. President Shafik, can you name a real world example of a system of oppression that favors white Jewish folks? Can you give us an example? Dr. Shafik. No. Mr. Banks. Do you believe that white Jewish folks are privileged, that is they are oppressors? Do you believe that? Dr. Shafik. No. Mr. Banks. This is what is being fed to your students. It is despicable. You have not done anything about it, you should do something about it. I yield back. Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you. If this is a document produced by the students, I would be interested in knowing if Columbia is paying for this document to be produced to distribute be distributed. Ms. Leger Fernandez, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. Leger Fernandez. Thank you, Madam Chair, and Ranking Member, and thank you to the witnesses for joining us today. The antisemitism experienced by Jewish students at Columbia University and universities across the country is unacceptable. I have met with several Jewish students from not several, but lots of Jewish students from across the county who have endured racial slurs, and threats, and my heart breaks each time I hear their stories, which I think it breaks for everybody on this Committee, and on the panel. Antisemitism is a century's old form of hatred rooted in white supremacy. It is also a form of hatred that has sadly been stoked and given a platform by some in the republican party. Madam Chair, I would like unanimous consent to enter into the record the article from Politico titled, ``Donald Trump Dined with White Nationalist Holocaust Denier Nick Fuentes.'' Chairwoman Foxx. Without objection.   Ms. Leger Fernandez. In case we do not remember, President Trump's remarks after the antisemitic white nationalist rally in Charlottesville in 2017, Madam Chair, I would like unanimous consent to enter into the record the article from the Atlantic titled, ``Trump Defends White Nationalist Protesters, Some Very Fine People on Both Sides.'' Chairwoman Foxx. Without objection.   Ms. Leger Fernandez. This Committee has held three hearings on antisemitism on collage campuses, but not one of these hearings has considered a bill to actually address the scourge of antisemitism. In fact, last fall House republicans proposed a 25 percent budget cut to the office that's actually investigating and can take action against universities if there is antisemitism on campuses that is actionable. The Committee could be more productive on this issue and hold a hearing on Congresswoman Manning's bipartisan, bicameral bill, H.R. 7921, The Countering Antisemitism Act. The bill would designate a senior official at the Department of Education to counter antisemitism on college campuses, among other solutions, provide data, get us the information we need so we can actually take action. We must do more than complain. We need to take action. We need to actually have solutions. Dr. Schizer, as Co-Chair of Columbia's task force on antisemitism, would you support the kind of legislation that gives us more data, and a mechanism to fight antisemitism? Mr. Schizer. Data is critical because we need to know more about the issues that we are addressing, and I have seen Congresswoman Manning's bill, and I think it is very well crafted. Ms. Leger Fernandez. Thank you. It has lots of provisions that actually would assist with the issues that we've heard about today. I would also point out that antisemitism is not the only form of hatred rising in our schools. It is not the only form of hatred that is impacting our children's, our student's ability to learn. Islamophobia, and hate crimes against LGBTQ students have also recently spiked. They have led to deaths by suicide, harassment, but this Committee has not held a single hearing on these issues. The rise in hatred across the United States is not good for learning. It is bad for democracy. We need to find a way to heal and have our students and have our entire nation understand that we are indeed one nation under God, different forms of Gods that we worship. That we can come to understand each other as related, and as connected and respect each other, and not tear each other down. That is when we truly start learning to prosper and thrive. I look forward to working on the kinds of solutions that get us to this point. I hope this Committee can be part of the solutions, and with that, Madam Chair, I yield back. Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you. Mr. Owens, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Owens. Thank you. Thank you very much. Back in December, I made a statement that I have seen this movie before, and that seems like it has not changed. I grew up in the deep south, 1960's, the days of KKK, Jim Crow and segregation. My first exposure to white Americans was not until I was 16 years old. I was one of four black athletes that integrated into an all white high school, and remember vividly the morning after Martin Luther King's assassination, I walked into a high school courtyard and seeing spray painted on the wall in red, ``Ding Dong the King is Dead.'' Let us fast forward to the experience of 2024. If I came to Columbia Campus, what would be the response of members of my race if they were harassed by KKK bigots, marked, carving in wood, spit upon, hit with a stick, ostracized, would these same bigots and racists be allowed to protest at Columbia's campus spewing anti-hate, anti-black hate speech? Instead of wearing the white KKK hoods, would these coward be granted free speech status if they hid their faces behind black masks, and full head scarves? At a total cost of $90,000.00 per year, would black students be forced to attend a class of a tenured Columbia professor, who are discussing the pass events of a massacre of black men and women, and children, black girls being raped, and black men being lynched. Would speak in glowing terms of this event as stunning, awesome, and astonishing? President, I would like to ask you would this treatment of black Americans be tolerated for 1 second? Dr. Shafik. What you have described, Congressman, is completely unacceptable. I too grew up in the south in the 1960's and share that experience. Mr. Owens. Yes or no, would this be tolerated for 1 second? Would this be tolerated, this treatment of black Americans for 1 second on Columbia's campus? Dr. Shafik. Absolutely not. Mr. Owens. Okay. I just want to continue this because if this would not be tolerated for blacks, why has it been for months and years? We are talking about a professor who goes back 20 years now. This guy has been around a long time. Why is it that Jewish Americans can then be treated by these bigots and bullies in this manner? Dr. Shafik. It is not tolerated, and it is not acceptable. Over the last 6 months we have done everything we can and have worked tirelessly to improve our policies. Mr. Owens. Okay. Let me just say this real quickly. Let me tell you why I think these two standards are prevalent. At Columbia's core, the core teaching values are DEI and CRT, which are racist and antisemitic teachings of Marxism. The racist beliefs are that blacks are hopeless, weak and an oppressed race that needs protection and pity of the white race. Antisemitic beliefs are that the Jewish race is the oppressor race, and that all minorities need to be protected from them, and therefore hate it. If you ever wondered why the heinous crimes of October 7th never moved the needle of empathy at Columbia, this is why. I personally think that it takes a true lowlife, repugnant human being to make the statement that the massacre of innocent men and women and children, the raping of girls, the beheading of children, the burning alive of human beings, was stunning, awesome and astonishing. What truly speaks volumes is the moral compass of Columbia, that this rabid antisemite is still on your payroll today. He has gotten cocky, and for 20 years he has done the same thing. It is just a little tip of the iceberg of what is going on there, and what has been taught in our classes. There is a statement from a Jewish student, it is impossible to exist as a Jewish student at Columbia without running face first into antisemitism every single day. Jew hatred is do deeply embedded into the campus culture, it has become casual among students, faculty, and neglected by the administrators. Do you agree with this statement, President? Dr. Shafik. I had met those students and heard those words in the listening sessions that I have been holding. I believe in leadership by presence and walking around, and I listened to those students, and it has distressed me hugely. Mr. Owens. Let me just--I am sorry, I hate to cut you off, I just have a few seconds here. Let me tell you what my major concern is, there are thousands of Columbia students coming from countries that hate America, and the other democracy in that region, Israel. How does this work? International students paying a total of $90,000.00 a year upfront, skip classes and demonstrate, bully Americans, burn American flags, stop traffic in our countries as they shout, ``Death to America.'' In some kind of way, they still get a degree. I think most of us, unless they are genius, most of us spend 100 percent of our time trying to pass our courses, particularly at $90,000.00 per year. I am running out of time. I will just say this. I would like to know how many of these folks are actually graduating, and what the degrees are, and how they are getting paid to come to our campus and bully our kids the way they are right now, and with that I would like to yield back. Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you. Mrs. Hayes, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. Hayes. Thank you. I would like to start before I get into my questions by saying that I am a woman of deep personal faith. My faith forces me to respect the faith of others. The injection of biblical theology into this Committee hearing is inappropriate. If we were to talk about that, I would say that my faith is used as a shield to protect others, and not a sword to hate or harm others. I guess I call myself a Matthew 25 Christian. There are a few things that I would like to clarify, or have the witnesses clear up before I get into my questions. Professor Schizer, my colleague suggested that students are getting away with hitting Jewish students on campus. Can you clarify that if someone physically attacks another student that it is not just antisemitism, it is also assault? Mr. Schizer. Absolutely. Mrs. Hayes. Does the university take action in those matters? Mr. Schizer. The university has to take action in those matters. Mrs. Hayes. Thank you. Dr. Shafik, it is my understanding that the Committee was told yesterday that Professor Massad is under investigation. Is that correct? Dr. Shafik. I would like to confirm that in writing if you do not mind. Mrs. Hayes. I cannot hear your answer. Dr. Shafik. I said I would like to confirm that in writing. Mrs. Hayes. Can you also clarify that he no longer holds a leadership position? Dr. Shafik. I would like to confirm that in writing, and I'm happy to followup with the Committee on that matter. Mrs. Hayes. Thank you. Can you get those things to the Committee as soon as this concludes? Dr. Shafik. Absolutely. Mrs. Hayes. I would appreciate that. There is no place for discrimination in education, no place at all. It should be the goal of all institutions at every level to create safe environments for students, free from harassment and violence. The rise in antisemitism in college campuses is unacceptable. According to the ADL who released data yesterday, 2023 was the worst year for antisemitic incidents since the ADL began recording more than four decades ago. There were 8,873 incidents reported across the United States in 2023, an increase of 140 percent compared to 2022, which was also a record setting year. According to that same report, Connecticut saw a 170 percent increase in antisemitic incidents in 2023. Islamophobia and anti-Muslim sentiments have also increased on college campuses. I applaud the Biden administration for releasing the national strategy to counter antisemitism, and the investigations by the Department of Education Office of Civil Rights for antisemitism at higher education institutes. This is not a problem that any one person or one group can solve, and we should be working here today on solutions. It is equally as important for school administrators to change the culture on their campuses. President Shafik, in your testimony you stated that in October 2023, you quickly formed a task force. In the March 2024 report, the task force made a series of recommendations that we heard today. Can you tell us has Columbia University begun to implement any of the recommendations made by the task force, and if so, what are there? Dr. Shafik. Yes, we have. In fact, our new demonstration policy was endorsed by the task force, and they had input into the idea of basically setting aside space where demonstrations could happen, so students who do not want to hear certain words do not have to hear them. That is already now implemented. Mrs. Hayes. I am sorry. Are there any enforcement mechanisms for those policies? Dr. Shafik. Yes. If students do not adhere to those rules, the demonstration policy outlines a series of disciplinary measures that would result Mrs. Hayes. Thank you. I know that there is a challenge of creating rules that appropriately distinguish between free speech and hate speech, but can you tell me what impact would an increase in funding have on the Department's ability to respond to the rise in antisemitism? You heard my colleagues say that funding, that does specifically this, has been cut? Dr. Shafik. Is that to me? Mrs. Hayes. Yes, I am sorry. Dr. Shafik. Yes. We would we know that there are a number of cases before the Department of Education around these issues. We would welcome guidance from the Department of Education as we try and define the boundaries, particularly around speech, so it would be helpful to us. Mrs. Hayes. Guidance without money will not help you achieve these goals. Dr. Shafik. Yes. It would be helpful I think from our perspective to get such information. Mrs. Hayes. Thank you. I have no further questions. I yield back. Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you, Mrs. Hayes. Mr. Good, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Good. Thank you, Madam Chairman. I will direct this first to Dr. Shafik. What does it say about college campuses like Columbia's today, that we are sitting here having a congressional hearing to discuss significant antisemitism, prevalent to a large degree on campuses like yours, and pro- terrorism sympathies on campuses like yours, how troubling is that to you? What does it say about our college campuses today and we are here doing this? Dr. Shafik. I am very troubled. I would say that we have 37,000 students, and I think the numbers that we are talking about who are crossing these lines are a very, very small number of our students. Mr. Good. Okay. Let me stop you there. Let me stop you there. Have there been any anti-Islamic demonstrations on campus, any anti-Muslim demonstrations on campus, any anti-Arab demonstrations on campus, anything like that happened? Dr. Shafik. There have been many pro-Israeli demonstrations on our campus. Mr. Good. No, that is not what I asked you. Dr. Shafik. There have been many incidents. Mr. Good. The answer would be no; correct? Dr. Shafik. Yes, sorry. Mr. Good. Okay, thank you. To the Board members if I may, what does it say about our college campuses today that we're having a hearing about antisemitic sympathies on campus, expressions on campus on a large scale and pro-terrorist expressions on campus on a significant scale? What does that say about college campuses today like Columbia's? Anyone want to answer that? Ms. Shipman. Congressman, I think it says we have a lot of work to do. It is shocking. Mr. Good. What does it say about what is happening on our college campuses, that this would even be an issue to such large degree, that we are holding yet another congressional hearing on this subject. Ms. Shipman. I think personally, I think it says that we have lost our way in terms of what we expect from each other in a learning community and in our society. I think we have got to learn to listen to all sorts of diversity, and we have to commit to speech that is not laced with hate and is not just meant to provoke for---- Mr. Good. All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate your efforts to try to answer that. President Shafik, as you know, on March 24th, just 3 weeks ago and 5 months after the October 7 terrorist attack in Israel, a coalition of a reported 94 Columbia student organizations, led by Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace, held an event with guest speakers who are connected to and supportive of known terrorist organizations. Khalid Barakat spoke at the event. He has been identified as a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a group that we, the United States, has designated a foreign terrorist organization. Another speaker was Charlotte Kates, who is affiliated with the Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, which is designated as a terrorist group by Israel. What does it say that we allowed that event to take place on campus, remotely, but hosted on campus, held on campus, what does that say about Columbia today? Dr. Shafik. We did not allow that event to happen. Students applied to host that event at Columbia. We twice said no. They then tried to host it at our neighbor Barnard, who also said no. They then decamped to a dorm room and held it online. We immediately, as soon as we notified the FBI, we brought in special investigators and---- Mr. Good. Well, let me stop you there. When did you learn this event was going to take place, or was trying to be held? Dr. Shafik. We learned on the day, and then we immediately contacted the FBI. Mr. Good. Were any safe spaces provided or other supportive measures created for students who might have felt threatened by the efforts to have this on campus, to have these speakers speaking remotely at least on campus? Were there any measures taken for those students who might have felt threatened by this? Dr. Shafik. They were in a private space, and as I said, all of the students who were involved in organizing that event have been suspended. Mr. Good. All right. One of the primary organizers of the event was Students for Justice in Palestine, which was suspended on November 10. But that was 4 months before the event took place. How could they be able to organize an event on campus? I mean what entities or groups would you prohibit from organizing an event on campus? What is the criteria for approval or disapproval to be able to do that? Dr. Shafik. We were one of the first universities to suspend Students for Justice in Palestine and the Jewish Voice for Peace---- Mr. Good. They were still able to hold an event. Dr. Shafik. They did not abide by our rules and held unsanctioned events. We quickly realized I think that was a very powerful symbol to say if student groups do not abide by the rules, there will be consequences for them. Mr. Good. I am sorry. With 8 seconds left, I am going to have to stop you. The Columbia University newspaper contained an op-ed from the Columbia University Apartheid Divest signed by 94 supporting student groups that were part of the coalition with Students for Justice in Palestine to host, organize the event. I would just like a response afterwards in writing as to whether or not these groups who were also supportive, the other 94 groups, whether or not they would have been suspended or have funds pulled or any consequences to the other 94 groups, as reported in the Columbia University newspaper. I apologize Madam Chairman for going over a little bit. I yield back. Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you. Your request to have an answer is duly noted. Mr. DeSaulnier, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Madam Chair. I want to thank all the witnesses for being here. Ms. Shipman, I was taken by your comment about when you were a young person and went to Columbia from the Midwest, that you were taught--you were taught how to think, not what to think. In that context, we are dealing with a complex issue historically, thousands of years in this instance. The use of technology and political consultants, the theater of today is quite remarkable, where you have a real legitimate, and I appreciate the bipartisan focus on the legitimate issues around hatred and prejudice. The technology to me is really fascinating. What makes this so unique to our time in this institution. Professors, have you looked at that in terms of social media and how we are a lot of work around, in this field, not in this specific field by researchers at UVA, Harvard. I think Susan Linn, her wonderful book at Who's Minding Our Kids, how we are using what we have discovered about neuroscience including prejudice and hatred and emotion and using technology to make it much worse for very narrow political reasons. Have you looked at that, and I would like to followup, given your history Ms. Shipman, in your career about how things have changed in that regard, about how people get information and how it is manipulated as we, as a culture and a civilization, try to figure out what the guardrails are, and the damage it causes in the meantime? Start with you Professor. Dr. Schizer. This is a question for me, right sir? Mr. DeSaulnier. Yes, no. First for you. Have you looked at social media and how people get information? Dr. Schizer. Yes. Congressman, it is very important that you raised that issue, because one of the most frustrating aspects of this is that people are posting anonymously, and they are posting absolutely horrible, horrible things. There are frustrations for all of us in trying to figure out how to stop that. More fundamentally, we are very mindful of the destructive aspect of this hate speech on social media. Mr. DeSaulnier. It is not organic in many ways. It is deliberately directed by people who want to divide people and create problems. Have you looked at that? I am thinking about a book, The Chaos Machine by a New York Times reporter who was the person who actually reported that You Tube was directing adolescent girls, right to the point where they could be through their depression and anxiety, to show them how to commit suicide. This is being used in these political environments--is my point right now. Dr. Schizer. It is very troubling, yes. Mr. DeSaulnier. Ms. Shipman, and the point that it is not organic, that it is quite deliberate. Whether it is people in the Russia or people in the United States doing this to people, to divide us as opposed to your career, or how it has evolved-- -- Ms. Shipman. I have a lot of thoughts about this sir. I am just trying to gather my thoughts. I think we--this is an issue that our university has been investigating for a long time in terms of the science, neuroscience, the flow of information at our journalism school. We have so many ways to look at this, and an important way for our society. I know we are working with a Nobel Prize winner, Maria Ressa, on this issue right now, disinformation. I will say a couple of things. I think the most fundamental thing I have learned in my time on the Board at Columbia is that, and this is from our incredible MindBrain Institute, which is just cutting-edge neuroscience, when people feel fear and intimidation, they cannot learn. I think I come back to the topic of this hearing, that we can look at all of the reasons why there are certainly new ways we all hate each other in our society right now, that are distressing. I think if we cannot provide fundamental safety for our students, we now know, we are not just guessing, that we are not allowing them to learn. Mr. DeSaulnier. I wonder if you have any comments or observations. Dr. Shafik. Congressman, you are absolutely right, that social media is part of the problem of and on this particular issue, we have seen it as pernicious. I am particularly uncomfortable with some of the anonymous channels, things like SideChat. Every student I meet, I tell them please get off Sidechat. It is poisonous and probably the most egregious cases that we have seen of antisemitism, Islamophobia, and racist comments have been on social media on those anonymous channels. We would welcome any improvement in content moderation which would reduce that. Mr. DeSaulnier. No, I really appreciate that. I am struck by this and the previous hearing, that I wonder what Brandeis and Holmes would be talking about if they were alive today, and their context a very similar economic and world strife time and World War I, where when they were discussing what is free speech and screaming fire in a crowded theater. I see the social media companies and technology companies as being those folks, who are benefiting from strife, and this is sort of an extreme example of how they are making, monetizing us fighting against one another in a very, very difficult position, where I think we would all agree that hatred and prejudice cannot be tolerated. Thank you. I yield back. Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you, Mr. DeSaulnier. Mrs. McClain, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. McClain. Thank you, Madam, Chair, and thank you all for being here today to discuss this very important topic. I think we have to go back to the beginning, and we have to identify the problem before we can really figure out solutions to the problem. I want to start with you, Dr. Shafik. What is your definition of antisemitism? Dr. Shafik. For me personally, any discrimination against people for their Jewish faith is antisemitism. Mrs. McClain. Okay, I appreciate that. You set up a task force. Do they share that same definition? Dr. Shafik. Congresswoman, I know the chair of our task force is next, sitting next to me. Mrs. McClain. No, but you are the president. I would like to hear from you first. Dr. Shafik. I am happy to answer the question. I know he would also. Mrs. McClain. I am happy to do that, but I would like to start with you, since you are the president, right? You own, the buck stops with you. Dr. Shafik. Completely. Mrs. McClain. Do they share that same definition? Dr. Shafik. I am pretty sure that they would share that definition. Mrs. McClain. Do not you think that would be a pretty important thing to start with? Dr. Shafik. Yes. Mrs. McClain. Okay. Are you concerned at all about the article by Sharon Otterman, which indicated that a Columbia University Task Force set up to combat antisemitism on campus in the wake of October 7th Hamas attack, is attempting to avoid one of the most contentious issues in the university's debate over the war. Its members--this is, and I do not know if it is true or not, so I would like to get your take. Dr. Schizer. Not true. Mrs. McClain. ``Its members have refused to settle on what the definition of antisemitism is.'' From your opinion, this is an inaccurate article. Dr. Shafik. Yes. Mrs. McClain. Okay, thank you. Dr. Shafik. Professor Schizer would be the best person to give you---- Mrs. McClain. I appreciate that. Professor, thank you. Do you have a definition of antisemitism? Dr. Schizer. Absolutely. Mrs. McClain. Okay. Can you share it with us? Dr. Schizer. Sure. It is bias against Jewish people, which can manifest as ethnic slurs, stereotyping, Holocaust denial, double standards as applies to Israel and antisemitic tropes. Mrs. McClain. Wonderful, I appreciate that. This article is in fact false? Dr. Schizer. It is inaccurate, yes. Mrs. McClain. Okay, thank you. I think we need to really take a look at the facts. Now that we have a clear, defined definition of what it is, what I am curious now, is what are the consequences to one's actions? Ms. Shafik, Dr. Shafik, can you share with us what the consequences are? Dr. Shafik. The consequences for antisemitic behavior. I am sorry, what are the consequences for antisemitic behavior? Mrs. McClain. Yes ma'am. Dr. Shafik. Yes. We one of the biggest things we focused on is we want to make it easy, so that if there is any antisemitic incident at Columbia, we know about it immediately. We have QR codes all over the campus. We have a hotline. We have a single---- Mrs. McClain. That is great. I am looking for an answer though. Dr. Shafik. Yes. Mrs. McClain. What are the consequences for antisemitic behavior? Dr. Shafik. Yes. Once we know of an incident, we have investigative capacity. We have invested hugely in expanding that investigative capacity, and depending on the nature of the incident, there are consequences ranging from people being potentially suspended, being forced to get educated and trained on antisemitism. Mrs. McClain. Wonderful, and we have executed those? Dr. Shafik. We are executing those, yes. Mrs. McClain. Okay. My question to you, are mobs shouting, ``From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free'' or ``Long live the Intifada,'' are those antisemitic comments? Dr. Shafik. When I hear those terms, I find them very upsetting, and I have heard---- Mrs. McClain. That is a great answer to a question I didn't ask, so let me repeat the question. When mobs or people are shouting ``From the river to the sea, Palestine must be free'' or ``Long live the Intifada,'' are those antisemitic statements, yes or no? It is not how you feel; it is---- Dr. Shafik. I hear them as such. Some people do not. We have sent a clear message---- Mrs. McClain. Is that yes? Is that yes? Dr. Shafik. We have sent clear message to our communities-- -- Mrs. McClain. I am not asking about the message. Does that fall under definition of antisemitic behavior, yes or no? Why is it so tough? Dr. Shafik. Because it is a--it is a difficult issue because---- Mrs. McClain. I realize it is a difficult issue. Here is the problem, is when people cannot answer a simple question and they have a definition but then they cannot. Well, I am not really sure if that qualifies. I am asking a simple question. Maybe I should ask your task force. Does that qualify as antisemitic behavior, those statements, yes or no. Dr. Schizer. Yes. Mrs. McClain. Yes, okay. Do you agree with your task force? Dr. Shafik. We agree. The question is what---- Mrs. McClain. The question--so yes, you do agree that those are--that is antisemitic behavior, and you should be--there should be some consequences to that antisemitic behavior. We are in agreement, yes? Dr. Shafik. Yes. Mrs. McClain. Thank you. I yield my time. Chairwoman Foxx. The gentlewoman yields. Pursuant to the previous order, the Chair declares the Committee in recess, subject to the call of the Chair. We do plan to reconvene in 5 minutes. I ask all the guests to remain in their seats until the witnesses are allowed to leave the room. The Committee stands in recess for 5 minutes.  Chairwoman Foxx. The Committee will reconvene and come to order following our recess. Mr. Bowman, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Bowman. Thank you so much Madam Chair and thank you to the witnesses for being here. You know, as we all aim to fight and end antisemitism once and for all, there is language and there are actions and incidents that take place that are clearly antisemitic, and then there are others where someone may have said something or done something that they did not quite understand that was wrong. What I am hearing from students and people in my district who go to Columbia is they feel that there is not the space for divergent opinions or thoughts as it relates to State of Israel or what is happening in Gaza right now. Can you speak to how different points of view or perspectives as it relates to the war in Gaza, criticism of the State of Israel or something like that that is not antisemitic but just a difference of opinion from other students? How does that, how is that adjudicated or confronted? How are we creating spaces for critical dialog and discussion that may make people feel uncomfortable, but are not like hateful? Can you speak to that first Madam President, and then we could just go down the line and everyone gives brief comments to that? Dr. Shafik. Congressman, it is a very good point. We launched at the end of last semester a program called Dialogue Across Difference to do exactly what you are saying, which is to give people tools to have difficult conversations where people disagree but are respectful. We have held, there have been maybe two to three events per week at Columbia for students and for faculty. Mr. Bowman. You said per week? Dr. Shafik. Yes. Mr. Bowman. Okay. Dr. Shafik. To practice that sort and model that sort of behavior. Mr. Bowman. Are those, are those events well attended by students with different points of view, coming together and having this dialog? Dr. Shafik. That is happening more. I will be candid with you, that immediately after October 7th, the atmosphere was tense. Mr. Bowman. It was very hard; it was very hard. Dr. Shafik. That is changing, and I am doing it myself personally in my listening sessions with students from both sides of the issues, and again those have been very emotional. I have had students in tears in those sessions. Mr. Bowman. Can we go down quickly? I know I do not have much time. Can you just quickly respond to that? Dr. Schizer. Thank you for the question. We are committed to ensuring that students can articulate competing points of view about extremely important issues like the Middle East, like the current war, like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and it would be a really unfortunate thing and a departure from our mission as a university if we were suppressing points of view. We absolutely do not want to do that, and at the same time we have free speech. We also have the responsibility not to engage in discrimination. Mr. Bowman. Of course. Now the time is moving, so I am going to let you answer, but I am going to shift slightly. How are we also fighting other forms of hate including Islamophobia at the university, which I have heard is happening also at the university as well? Can you two quickly respond to that? Ms. Shipman. We are listening to all of our students. All hate should not be welcome at Columbia. I have personally met with a large number of Jewish students and a lot of our Muslim students from the region who do feel stressed and scared, scared about walking to class. I mean we have to listen, and we have to allow for political debate, as Professor Schizer said. That is a bedrock of our democracy. I spent 5 years living in the Soviet Union. I can tell you; you do not want to no political debate. You do not want the result of that, but we cannot let political debate cross into hate. We have a special job as an educational institution. Mr. Bowman. Uh-huh, absolutely. Mr. Greenwald. Mr. Greenwald. All hate is abhorrent. Further, the lessons that we are learning coming out of the task force, those principles will be applicable not just to antisemitism but to other forms of hate as well. Mr. Bowman. Absolutely. Just to ensure that there are additional voices as part of this conversation, I want to enter for the record, I have a letter here from over 600 faculty, staff, students, parent and alumni of Columbia and Barnard, expressing their commitment to open, honest inquiry on campus. I ask unanimous consent to enter the letter into the record. Chairwoman Foxx. Without objection.   Mr. Bowman. In the last 15 seconds that I have, Madam President, can you respond to the, there was a so-called chemical attack on campus at one point, targeting so-called pro-Palestinian students. Can you quickly respond to that? Dr. Shafik. It appears to have been an odorous substance that was sprayed on demonstrators. The individuals involved have been suspended from Columbia. Mr. Bowman. Suspended from the school. They no longer attend the school, the students who were involved? Dr. Shafik. Correct, correct. Mr. Bowman. Okay, thank you, and I yield back. Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you. Mrs. Steel, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. Steel. Thank you, Dr. Foxx. For over two decades, Columbia's Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies Department has been extremely hostile to Israel and Jewish students. Professor Joseph Massad, who vocally praised Hamas; Professor Hamid Dabashi, who has made numerous antisemitic remarks, including that ``Israelis have a vulgarity of character and that it is bone-deep and structured to the skeletal, you know, I cannot even pronounce, vertebrae of its culture.'' Rashid Khalidi, a professor of your university now and former PLO spokesperson, called Columbia's antisemitism task force ``bigots and fanatics and right wingers and extremists.'' This is all on the record. Do you think this kind of conduct is appropriate and acceptable, and what kind of action did you take after these professors were talking like this? Yes. Dr. Shafik. Congresswoman Steel, thank you for that question. Before I answer it, I know Representative Hayes asked me to confirm in writing about ongoing investigations of some of the faculty that you've described. I just wanted to confirm now that both Professors Massad and Franke are currently under investigation for discriminatory remarks. I just wanted to put that on the record for this occasion. On the broader point that you raise, what I would say is that-- -- Mrs. Steel. Just before you go to that, how about the other two professors? Dr. Shafik. I am going to come to that. Mrs. Steel. All three of them? Dr. Shafik. Sorry. Which ones are you referring to? Mrs. Steel. It is Professor Joseph Massad. Dr. Shafik. Yes. Mrs. Steel. Professor Hamid Kabashi and you hired Rashid Khalidi, professor of your university, the former PLO spokesperson. Dr. Shafik. We do not have any ongoing complaints around those other two professors. What I would say is since I have been in this role, which I am just entering my ninth month, we have put in place mechanisms so that if faculty cross the line in terms of any harassing or discriminatory behavior, there will be consequences. We can remove people from leadership roles. We can--we can discipline, you know, we can remove them from the classroom. We can, in some cases have them removed from Columbia altogether, and we have several cases like that. We are making sure that going forward, faculty who cross the line and discriminate or harass students on any issue, there will be consequences. Mrs. Steel. Yes. You know what? I am not just making it up. This happened, and this is the statement that we took out from the newspapers and other media. You really have to find out. Nothing really happened to these three university professors, on what they were talking about at these rallies. Then let us just move on then. Columbia alumni have called on the university to place the department into academic receivership, as it has done for its English and Anthropology Departments. Will you consider placing the department into receivership? Dr. Shafik. I guess academic departments at Columbia are, there is not really a notion of receivership. What I would say is--one of the things that I am very committed to is we have a broad offering of almost 50 courses on Israeli, Jewish and Middle Eastern Studies at Columbia. We also have an opportunity I think at this moment, because so many students are interested and there is so much demand and need frankly for education about these issues, that we are looking at expanding and hiring some new faculty to try and broaden our approach, to make sure that we have some new and fresh thinking in the areas of Israeli, Jewish and Middle East Studies. Mrs. Steel. What kind of broader thinking and what kind of expansion are you talking about? Dr. Shafik. We will be hiring additional faculty going forward, that will bring new perspectives. Mrs. Steel. Are--you are going to do all those background checks and their records though, because your professors already talk about this kind of statements, and this is not really acceptable. Dr. Shafik. We will do all of the background checks that you would expect for our faculty, because it is a privilege to teach at Columbia. Mrs. Steel. It is not just the English and Anthropology Departments, but do you consider the Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies Department a balanced and well run department? Over two decades they were extremely hostile to Israel. Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you, Ms. Steel. We will get answers to your questions. Ms. Omar, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. Omar. Thank you. President Shafik, I wanted to get a clarification earlier. One of my colleagues asked if you have you seen anti-Muslim protests on campus? Dr. Shafik. We have had pro-Israeli demonstrations on campus. Ms. Omar. No, no, no. Dr. Shafik. Not---- Ms. Omar. Just a protest that was against Muslims? Dr. Shafik. No, I have not. Ms. Omar. Have you seen one against Arabs? Dr. Shafik. No, I have not. Ms. Omar. Have you seen one against Palestinians? Dr. Shafik. No, I have not. Ms. Omar. Have you seen one against Jewish people? Have you seen a protest saying we are against Jewish people? Dr. Shafik. No. I have, I have seen---- Ms. Omar. Okay. Thank you for that clarification. There has been a rise in targeting and harassment against anti-war protestors, because it is been pro-war, and anti-war protestors is what it seems like; correct? Dr. Shafik. Correct. There has been---- Ms. Omar. Okay, thank you. Activists on campus including Jewish students, black and brown, Arab and Muslim students. How many of the organizations that were canceled in Columbia involved Jewish students? Dr. Shafik. One of the organizations was called Jewish Voices for Peace. Ms. Omar. Yes, and encompassed of Jewish students? Dr. Shafik. Yes. Ms. Omar. Okay, thank you. There is been a recent attack on the democratic rights of students across the country. I was appalled to learn that in April, Columbia suspended and evicted six students for their involvement in the pro-Palestinian panel event on campus. It happened that all six students were peculiarly targeted after the university brought in a team of private and former police investigators. These investigators harassed, intimidated Palestinian students at their homes, demanding to see students' private text messages and sent threatening emails to the leaders of those pro-Palestinian groups. I would like to ask you to speak a little bit more to this situation, and ask you if you guys have utilized private former police investigators before, or is this the first time? Dr. Shafik. This was a very serious case. We had students who on an online call---- Ms. Omar. If you could shorten your answer, that would be really appreciated. Dr. Shafik. Of course, who invited people who are inciting violence and that is unacceptable. We needed to get to the bottom of it, and so that is why we brought private investigators along with notifying the FBI---- Ms. Omar. How secure were you, these students that you evicted and suspended were involved? Did you do any investigation? Was there a hearing? Dr. Shafik. They refused to cooperate with the investigation, and so until they do so, they are suspended. Ms. Omar. Okay, thank you. Then in January, there was-- there was an incident involving students that were protesting that were attacked with a toxic chemical substance, leaving many hospitalized. A lot of them did not receive support from the school administrators. Can you speak to what is happening with the investigation, if you are cooperating, and why were not the students provided any support after they experienced that attack? Dr. Shafik. This is still with the police, and as far as we know, we think it was an odorous substance, and we did reach out to all of those students who said they were affected. Many of them did not want support. Ms. Omar. It took you guys more than 4 days to reach out to students. Dr. Shafik. No, I do not believe that is correct. Ms. Omar. Okay. Will you respond, give me a written response with the fact that you all responded right away to those students? Dr. Shafik. Yes, I would be happy to do that. Ms. Omar. All right, appreciate that. It looks like there has been a lot of doxing and harassment that has taken place. What protections are students being provided? Dr. Shafik. Yes. We created a doxing resources group to support students. There were many students who were affected by this, Muslim students, Jewish students and completely, you know, other students. That group has, we had 90 students reach out to that group to get support in terms of both technical support, legal support, privacy scrubbing and so on---- Ms. Omar. Before I run out of time, I wanted to ask what, what do your rules say about professors that harass students online, like Professor Shai Davidai has done and professors who directly attack you as the president, as a coward and a liar? Dr. Shafik. As president, I am used to being attacked. Attacking our students is unacceptable, and in that case, we have had more than 50 complaints about that professor, and he is currently under investigation. Ms. Omar. Okay. Dr. Shafik. For harassment and intimidation. Ms. Omar. I would love to followup on that as well. Thank you so much. I yield back. Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you. Mr. Kiley, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Kiley. President Shafik, earlier today the question was posed are chants of ``From the river to the sea'' antisemitic, and Professor Schizer, head of the Antisemitism Task Force at Columbia gave a very clear answer, yes. You on the other hand hemmed and hawed, and then eventually said I hear them as such. Some people do not. What are you talking about there? Who are these people that you are referring to? Dr. Shafik. Well, I think even surveys by the Anti- Defamation League, and others have shown that even, that some Jewish people do not hear that as antisemitic, whereas I would say the majority do. It is one of those phrases that is heard differently---- Mr. Kiley. That is who you were referring to, is the Jewish population, some sector of it? Dr. Shafik. Some yes, and I have received letters from our Jewish faculty who say that they also do not think it is antisemitic. I think Congressman, I think you put your finger on a challenging issue. We have sent a message to our community. All of the deans of Columbia University, all 17 of them, for the first time wrote a letter to the community saying these words are hurtful and are heard in a hurtful way. Mr. Kiley. Okay, that is good, and I am glad that Professor Schizer was able to give us a very clear answer yes, but you were not able to do so. I think if I were to go through a number of other racial slurs and ask you if those are offensive, if these are racist, I do not think you would say I hear them as such, some people do not, would you? Dr. Shafik. I think, I believe, I am happy to give you my personal opinion, but I think the question that you are really asking me is, are they forbidden to be said at Columbia? Mr. Kiley. That is not what I am asking actually. Dr. Shafik. Okay, all right. Well then, I am happy to give you---- Mr. Kiley. I think we saw your instinct is that you are, I am wondering who are you risking, who are you worried about offending? That is my question. Dr. Shafik. No, no, no. I feel like I am speaking as president of Columbia, so that is the way in which I answered those questions. Mr. Kiley. Let us talk about Columbia. Are there antisemitic professors on your faculty? Dr. Shafik. I certainly hope not, and if I have any evidence that there are, there will be consequences. Mr. Kiley. You do not think there is evidence of antisemitism among professors on your faculty? Dr. Shafik. We have seen some cases, and there have been consequences. Mr. Kiley. You mentioned Mr. Abdou and Mr. Massad. You said they are both under investigation; is that correct? Dr. Shafik. Mr. Massad is under investigation. Mr. Abdou has been told he will not work at Columbia again. Mr. Kiley. He has been fired? Dr. Shafik. He is leaving. Mr. Kiley. I do not understand the distinction there. Fired versus he is leaving? Dr. Shafik. Yes. No, he is, he is leaving, and he has a written record on his record that says---- Mr. Kiley. He was not fired, but he is voluntarily leaving? Dr. Shafik. No, no, no. He has been told he---- Mr. Kiley. He has to leave? Dr. Shafik. Yes, he has been told he has to leave. Mr. Kiley. Okay. Do you think he is antisemitic? Dr. Shafik. He has written and said things which are in support of Hamas, which I find very problematic and---- Mr. Kiley. When, by the way, was he told to leave? Dr. Shafik. I want to make sure I have the right date for you, but it was in the, you know, sometime in the last few weeks is my recollection. Mr. Kiley. In the last how long? Dr. Shafik. I would be happy to get it to you in writing, because I want to make sure I give you the right date. Mr. Kiley. Did you retain counsel in preparation for this hearing? Dr. Shafik. We had lots of, you know, we did a lot of preparation for this hearing, yes. Mr. Kiley. Okay. How many hours would you say you spent preparing? Dr. Shafik. Well, this is a very, very serious matter, and so I have spent many, many hours. Mr. Kiley. Many, many hours, and you have given us very divergent responses as to some of the worst offending professors about how they have been handled. Why is that? Why cannot you just give us the facts? Dr. Shafik. I have offered to give you the facts. I am happy to provide you with the details. I just do not recall the exact date when he was notified, and I want to make sure I am giving you an accurate answer. It is a very serious matter. Mr. Kiley. Sure. Would you be willing to make just a statement right now to any members of the faculty at your university, that if they engage in antisemitic words or conduct, that they should find another place to work. Can you make that statement? Dr. Shafik. I would be happy to make a statement that anyone, any faculty member at Columbia who behaves in an antisemitic way or in any discriminatory way should find somewhere else to go. Mr. Kiley. Thank you. Do you believe that the BDS movement is antisemitic? Dr. Shafik. Columbia has on numerous occasions refused to well, sorry, that is not the right--has faced the issue of BDS. In fact, we had---- Mr. Kiley. Do you think it is antisemitic, the BDS movement? Dr. Shafik. I think it is a political movement that is advocating a boycott or a sanctioning process which is focused---- Mr. Kiley. Once again, who are you worried about offending by making a very clear statement on this? Dr. Shafik. No, I am-happy to make a clear statement on it. Mr. Kiley. Okay. Well, I want to close my questioning by giving you an opportunity to address some of the students who are here, because we have some really courageous students who have come, who have testified, who have met with our committee, who were at our press conference this morning. Many of them could not get into the room because it was too small. They have told harrowing stories of what they have endured on your campus, and they say that the response of your administration has been inadequate, has been insufficient. Are they wrong? I mean what would you say to these students? Dr. Shafik. I have met with these students myself. In fact, I have met many of the students who are in this room, and we have talked about it. I think I have assured them that there are times when I have been very frustrated with the policies and capacity that we have at Columbia to respond to this. I have been working tirelessly to fix those problems and improve our response, and I think we can show concrete improvements in the way we have been handling antisemitism during my time. Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you, Mr. Kiley. Ms. McBath, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. McBath. Thank you, Chairwoman Foxx and Ranking Member Scott. Thank you to those of you that are here as our witnesses today. I have read your testimoneys. We have had multiple hearings on this issue of antisemitism on campuses, and I really do appreciate the Chair's commitment to continuing to have these conversations, thank you. During one of them, I brought up the Anti-Defamation League's most recent data from their annual audit of antisemitic incidents, and I shared alarming data about the frequency of these acts of hate. Last time this data was published, it translated to over ten incidents a day, a disturbing amount that is truly in its own right. According to the newest data published just a few days ago, that number has now skyrocketed to 24 incidents per day, basically one per hour. This is absolutely heartbreaking and truly unacceptable, and it shows the depth of the work that we must continue to champion. Work like the President's National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism and providing the support necessary to the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Education. Increasing funding would truly ensure that the resources necessary are available, so that we can look back a year from now and hopefully be able to say that we did not have the highest number of antisemitic incidents on record. That is unfortunately not something that I have been able to do or see during my 5 years here serving on this Committee. My community in metropolitan Atlanta, home to the largest Jewish community in the Deep South, is no stranger to any of these kinds of incidents. We see more hatred in our discourse and more violence in our communities than we have ever seen before. Time and time again, antisemitic vandalism and the white supremacist symbols appear in our neighborhoods, in the districts that I represent, and we have stood together in condemning them. Now I understand how important it is for all in our community to support one another, regardless of our faith, regardless of our ethnicity. Many people do not know that a large number of the supporters of the NAACP were Jewish, or of community's collective history and common interest. My father was branch president of the Illinois NAACP during the civil rights movements, and I distinctly remember when our local Jewish community stood up to support us, as we were on the front lines fighting for civil and human rights. One community that was one of the first to voice support for those of us that were fighting on the front lines, and that had a very serious impact on me. A Jewish professor at Columbia served as NAACP chair in the early 1900's, and I am proud to carry on our long partnership in the fight against racism, hatred and antisemitism. To know that your community stands with you in your greatest hour of need, it means absolutely everything. Mr. Schizer, do you know if Columbia's currently taking any steps to renew their strong legacy of interracial and interreligious connections on campus? Dr. Schizer. I will say this. I am moved by what you said, and I completely agree with it. Issues like racism and antisemitism are not partisan issues; they are American issues, and in that spirit, I know President Shafik has been emphasizing how important it is for us all to come together and we may not agree. I mean we absolutely should not agree on everything. We need to treat each other with respect, and I think her leadership on that issue has been extremely important. Ms. McBath. Well, thank you for that. Can you then please just talk a little bit about their importance and what the building those connections and relationships actually looks like on campus? Dr. Shafik. Congresswoman, I completely agree with you, and I think one of the things I have said over and over is that antisemitism is not a problem for Jewish people to solve. It is actually a problem for all of us, and you I think said it much better than I have ever said it. We are looking at how to invest more in interfaith dialog at Columbia. We have a group. I have met with them, but I think at this particular moment it merits further support in order to rebuild our community. Ms. McBath. I thank you so much. I do appreciate all the efforts that I believe everyone in this room really is making. I do not--I truly believe in humanity. I truly believe in our ability to put our differences aside for the common good, and I hope that everyone in this room would find at a time such as now to do so, and I yield back. Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you, Ms. McBath. Mr. Bean, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Bean. Thank you. Thank you very much Madam Chair and good afternoon. Columbia beats Harvard and UPenn. You all have done something that they were not able to do. You have been able to condemn antisemitism without using the phrase ``it depends on the context.'' The problem is, action on campus does not match your rhetoric today, and you are saying the right things. You are saying we are not going to tolerate it, but we see the videos. We see what is happening on social media, and just this morning all of these students, your students, your students, their message is quite different. Their message is one of fear. How about that? They cannot walk across campus without getting the F word yelled at them, ``F Jews,'' Intifada, all kinds of things. My hearts aches for them. It should be hard academically at Columbia, but it should not be hard to walk across campus and it is. Words do not match your actions. You can have 200 meetings. You can put people on double secret probation as you have. You can write very strongly worded letters, do not ever do it again. That is not solving the problems. Look at the fear in their eyes right now. One of them said this morning in a press conference that we got to spend some time with that security on campus, are you ready for this, security on campus told them ``remove anything that identifies you as Jewish when things get hot.'' That is the way to stay safe on Columbia's campus, do not look Jewish and you will be safe. Is that your policy, Madam President, to stay safe, just do not look Jewish? Dr. Shafik. Not at all, and I think---- Mr. Bean. Have you met with them? I know you have met with them. I know you met with them two hundred times, but why is their message different from yours? Why are they saying it happens all the time every week going to class? Are you aware of that? It is a yes or no question. Are you aware that there is a problem on campus? You are aware? Yes is the right answer, you are aware. As president of the board Ms. Shipman, thank you for being here. Are you aware though that this once prestigious university's reputation is just going down the toilet, because of all of the antisemitism that is flourishing on campus. Are you aware? Ms. Shipman. I am aware of how serious this moment is. I appreciate your urgency. We are not done, I recognize---- Mr. Bean. Have we quadrupled security on campus? Have we expelled students? How many students have we expelled? Dr. Shafik. We have massively increased our security. Mr. Bean. Have we expelled anybody? There are so many hate groups on campus. I just, I want you all to know, there is got to be--this is America. It is 2024 and you should not fear going to the library just because of your faith. Madam Chair, I yield the rest of my time to the gentlelady from New York, Ms. Stefanik. Ms. Stefanik. Dr. Shafik, you answered one of the questions of our colleagues across the aisle. You said there has been no anti-Jewish protests. Do the other individuals on the panel agree with that? Let us start with you, Professor Schizer? Dr. Schizer. I think there have been antisemitic protests, so I would say yes. Ms. Stefanik. You disagree. There have been anti-Jewish protests. Ms. Shipman. Ms. Shipman. I know there have been a number of incidents, especially one at our law school recently that the students were trying to call a protest, but it was an event to harass admitted students who were Jewish, and it is outrageous. Ms. Stefanik. That is anti-Jewish. The answer would be yes? Ms. Shipman. Yes. Ms. Stefanik. Mr. Greenwald. Mr. Greenwald. There have been antisemitic events on campus, which I interpret as anti-Jewish. Ms. Stefanik. Dr. Shafik, you realize that at some of these events, the slurs and the chants have been ``F the Jews, death to Jews, F Israel, No safe place, death to the Zionist State, Jews out.'' You do not think those are anti-Jewish? Dr. Shafik. Completely anti-Jewish, completely unacceptable, horrible. Ms. Stefanik. You change your testimony on that issue as well? There have been anti-Jewish protests. Dr. Shafik. I did not get to finish my sentence. What I was going to say is there were protests that were called that were---- Ms. Stefanik. That is not what you were asked. You were asked were there any anti-Jewish protests, and you said no. Dr. Shafik. The protest was not labeled as an anti-Jewish protest---- Ms. Stefanik. I am not asking what it was labeled. Dr. Shafik . It was labeled as an anti-Israeli government policy. Ms. Stefanik. The question was what it was labeled. Dr. Shafik. Antisemitic incidents have happened, or antisemitic things were said. Ms. Stefanik. It is anti-Jewish protest. You agree with that? You change your testimony? Dr. Shafik. Congresswoman, anti-Jewish things were said at protests, yes. Ms. Stefanik. Thank you for changing your testimony. Another instance when you changed your testimony is you stated that Professor Massad was no longer chair. Then you stated he is under investigation. He is still chair on the website. Has he been terminated as chair? Dr. Shafik. Congresswoman, I want to confirm the facts before getting back to you. Ms. Stefanik. I know you confirmed that he was under investigation. Dr. Shafik. Yes, I can confirm that. Ms. Stefanik. Did you confirm he was still the chair? Dr. Shafik. I need, I need to confirm that. Ms. Stefanik. Well, let me ask you this. Will you make the commitment to remove him as chair? Dr. Shafik. I think that would be, I think I would, yes. Let me come back with yes. I think I just want to confirm his current status before I---- Ms. Stefanik. We will take that as a yes, that you will confirm that he will no longer be chair. Chairwoman Foxx. Mr. Bean's time has expired. Mr. Scott, you are recognized for 5 minutes. I am sorry, you want to be last, Ms. Chavez-DeRemer? You are recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. Chavez-DeRemer. Thank you, Madam Chair. I want to thank the witnesses for being here today. The widespread antisemitism we are seeing on college campuses is one of the most important issues in higher education. Since the horrific terror attacks of October 7th, Jewish students have found themselves constantly under attack for simply being Jewish. Dr. Shafik, Columbia has been one of the worst offenders. I place that responsibility of campus safety right at the feet of university presidents, and in this case, it is you. Jewish students fear for their lives at your university. They have been harassed, threatened and assaulted by fellow classmates. It is no wonder students think this is okay. They are learning in class how to target Jews. At our hearing with the presidents of MIT, Harvard and UPenn, I highlighted the astonishingly low number of courses being offered on Jewish history. Dr. Shafik, I also looked into your university's course offerings for this semester. You only have three classes that teach the history of Israel. Two of them are taught by Israelis and Jews, but those two classes combined only have 30 seats. The third class can have up to 60 students, and that class of course is taught by Joseph Massad, someone this Committee is all too familiar with. Joseph Massad has been surrounded by controversy for his antisemitic rhetoric since the early 2000's. He praised the brutal attack, as we have heard today of Hamas on October 7th as awesome, astonishing and astounding. He called the videos that showed murder and rape of Israeli women ``stunning.'' Dr. Shafik, I have been to the towns attacked by Hamas. Let me tell you, there is nothing awesome or astounding about the rape and murder of thousands of innocent civilians. Dr. Shafik, Joseph Massad has been a problem for more than 20 years. Why have you not shown that antisemitism is not tolerated at your university by firing him? I know you have commented on that already today. Does Columbia support this type of speech? Dr. Shafik. No, and as I said, he is under investigation. I also, if I may, speak to your question about our course offerings. Before this hearing, the two directors of our Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies came to see me, and they said to me make sure the Committee knows that Columbia is not a hotbed of antisemitism, but that we are a pioneer in Jewish studies. Ms. Chavez-DeRemer. Two classes is not going to prolifically tell that to the world, and that is the story that needs to be told. Let me--excuse me. Dr. Massad is a tenured professor, but that does not mean he cannot be fired; correct? Can he be fired? Dr. Shafik. There are some very complex issues around tenure we are looking at---- Ms. Chavez-DeRemer. At Columbia University, ``An appointment with tenure may be terminated for cause, only when a faculty member is found to be professionally unfit, as demonstrated, for example, by gross inefficiency, habitual and intentional neglect of duty, other serious breaches of academic conduct or serious personal misconduct.'' Dr. Shafik, you told Congressman Walberg earlier today that if given the opportunity to grant Dr. Massad a tenured position today, you would not. In your opinion, has his antisemitism conduct risen to be professionally unfit or a serious breach of academic conduct or serious professional misconduct? Dr. Shafik. As I said, he is being investigated. Ms. Chavez-DeRemer. He can be fired, according to this quote. Dr. Shafik. According to our rules, there are certain conditions under which tenured faculty---- Ms. Chavez-DeRemer. Okay, moving on. As I said back in December, the most powerful mover of campus culture is education itself, and you said that today. We can stop this if we educate the future about Israel, and again those classes do not prove that you are taking action with what you said. Columbia has shown through its choices on faculty and course offerings that you do not care about antisemitism, that you will turn a blind eye to the attacks on the most persecuted people of the last 5,000 years. That is why you let Joseph Massad teach at a class bigger than all the other Israeli history classes combined. That is why you continue to allow your Jewish students to be harassed, threatened and assaulted on your campus. Dr. Shafik, you said earlier today that the best way to combat antisemitism is through that education. I am going to say it once again. Since there are only three undergrad courses Columbia offers on Jewish and Israeli history, will you commit to pushing your deans to add more courses on Jewish history, and remove those who teach and praise antisemitic violence like Joseph Massad? Dr. Shafik. Our Institute for Israeli and Jewish Studies offers 21 courses. We have a collaborative arrangement with the Jewish Theological Seminary, and many of the students who are doing the joint degree with the Jewish Theological Seminary are here. Ms. Chavez-DeRemer. It is time your Jewish students finally see that you actually care about their safety. Teach these classes and fire the racists. It is a pretty low bar. We will be watching to see if you do that, and Madam Chair, I yield back my time. Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you. Mr. Williams, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Williams. Thank you, Madam Chairman. You know, I am really puzzled about how a university with such a prestigious reputation, such immense resources and such a storied history arrived at such a dissolute and depraved place. It is very stunning. Just to address these questions to the board members, in the last 20 years, have there been Columbia professors or students who have been forced to retire or leave the university because of denouncements by fellow staff members or accusations by students, pressures from outside groups? Mr. Greenwald. I have been on the board, this is my sixth year on the board, but I do not recall actions of that nature happening. Mr. Williams. Ms. Shipman Ms. Shipman. Yes. I have been on the board 10 years, and neither do I. Mr. Williams. Professor Serbin, you do not recall his leaving? He believes that the university was Communist, was his words? You do not recall that?  Mr. Williams. Professor Schizer, you have been there some years. Are you aware publicly or privately that any of your colleagues have left the university, either because they believe their beliefs are not welcome or because they feel like they have no upward mobility because of their beliefs? Dr. Schizer. I am not remembering a case like that, sir. Mr. Williams. No one has come to you privately and said hey, Columbia is not the place for me. This is hostile because of, I am a conservative or I am Jewish, or I hold any beliefs that seem to be contrary to the university? Dr. Schizer. Look, I am a conservative at Columbia Law School. I was dean for 10 years. The place has been good to me. Mr. Williams. Are there a lot--are there a lot of people like you? Are you afraid to speak out? Dr. Schizer. I do want to say that I am not the norm, and I would love more conservatives. Mr. Williams. How much investment, again to the board members, how much investment has Columbia received by foreign governments, their donors or significant donations from foreign individuals from countries like China, Qatar, Saudi Arabia? I know that the Committee's asked for that information. Do you have that number for us today? Mr. Greenwald. I do not have that number at hand. Mr. Williams. Are you aware of significant donations from any of those locations to the university in your tenure of 6 years? Mr. Greenwald. I am aware that we received funds from at least some of those countries. Mr. Williams. Which ones specifically? Mr. Greenwald. I do not remember all the ones you mentioned. Did you mention China sir? Mr. Williams. I did. Mr. Greenwald. Okay. China sends many students to Columbia University, and my understanding is the State pays their tuition. Mr. Williams. President Shafik, are faculty and staff required to sign DEI statements to be employed or to continue their employment at Columbia? Ms. Shafik. No. Mr. Williams. They are not required to provide DEI statements? I am pretty sure that is part of your employment process, is that not right? Ms. Shafik. I think--I think some departments ask faculty to talk about what they bring that is different to that department or to that role, and that is an optional thing that they can add to an employment---- Mr. Williams. It is optional, and if you refuse to, then it has no bearing on your hiring at the school. Is that really what you are saying? Dr. Shafik. Frankly, I think it depends on the needs of that particular department. You know, if the Math Department or the Biology Department or the Neuroscience Department has issues around, they're missing certain perspectives on their faculty, they might pay more attention to it. Others might not. I think it is very much dependent on---- Mr. Williams. The DEI policy at Columbia does not require statements from faculty, administrators as part of their H.R. process? That is what you are saying? Dr. Shafik. We do not have a central DEI office at Columbia. We have schools and faculties who think about what are the different perspectives that they've got on their faculty, and then they make choices about what is missing in terms of perspectives, backgrounds, skills that are needed for the faculty, and that they have people who are working on those issues at the school and departmental level. Mr. Williams. I think, personally I think that you are in deep denial about the culture at Columbia, in terms of the actual openness to views that differ from the culture of the school, where your money comes from, the disruption of classes, and the DEI statements. I just want to enter into the record, Madam Chairwoman, a webpage from the U.S. Holocaust Museum website that describes the Nazi takeover of German universities in the 1930's, and frankly I see the parallels as striking. It is entitled ``German Universities in the Nazi Regime,'' something like that. It really talks about, that there were denouncements of professors for views that were not consistent. It talks about the influence of outside groups, particularly money, where statements of loyalty were required in order to continue at the university, and that the teaching quality dropped significantly because politics and adherence to politics triumphed over adherence to academic excellence. Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you, Mr. Williams. Without objection, what you are requesting will be placed in the record.   Mr. Williams. Thank you. I yield back. Chairwoman Foxx. Mr. Moran, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Moran. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. There are times in my district when constituents asked me frequently whether Committee hearings have real, tangible purpose, and are effective in creating change. In answer to that question, I need only point to the series of Committee hearings that the House Committee on Education and the Workforce has held over the past 6 months on antisemitism in higher education, to resoundingly answer yes. These hearings do make a difference and do create change. I think it is clear today that this panel has learned at least some of the lessons from the magnificent failures of Harvard, MIT and UPenn when they appeared here several months back. What is my question still remaining is whether or not it is just talk, or whether or not real action will follow to change what has occurred on the campus of Columbia University. I had a whole series of questions prepared on a number of different circumstances and people and what they said and what their responses were, but my colleagues before me have actually covered most of that. Here is what I really want to talk about today, because I think that there is a foundational issue behind all of this. It is the foundational issue about truth. I think one of the reasons why it has been difficult for university presidents to sit before us and to actually answer questions affirmatively is because they fear declaring what they know to be truth. They are fearing the pushback. I happen to believe that there are absolute truths in this world, truths that are objective and not subjective, truths that should stand even when it is unpopular or when it is hard. I want to ask each one of you on the panel, do you agree with that statement? Dr. Shafik. Dr. Shafik. Congressman Moran, I can assure you I am not afraid of telling the truth, and I am not afraid of doing things that might be unpopular. Mr. Moran. No, that was not my question. Do you believe that there are absolute truths in this world that are objectively true? Dr. Shafik. Yes. Dr. Schizer. Absolutely. Mr. Moran. Ms. Shipman. Ms. Shipman. Yes, I agree. Mr. Moran. Good. Mr. Greenwald. Mr. Greenwald. Yes. Mr. Moran. Good. I think--I happen to think that one of these absolute truths is that each person in this world was created with equal and eternal value. Do you agree with that Dr. Shafik? Dr. Shafik. I do, I do. Mr. Moran. Professor. Dr. Schizer. Absolutely, definitely. Ms. Shipman. Certainly. Mr. Greenwald. Yes. Mr. Moran. These are what are called softball questions, and what I can tell you is I am afraid that actually some of the people that you employ and some of your colleagues at other institutions actually do not believe that. The greater question is are you going to enforce that? Are you going to apply those principles? Are you going to apply that truth? I want to commend Mr. Greenwald for some of the very direct answers that you have given today, because quite honestly, we have not heard direct answers from a few of you today. You have given some good answers today, some things that we need to hear. We need to see action, not just hearing it here today, because there is a lot of students here today that needed your action in the last 6 months, and you have not given the action they need to push back against the untruth that is in this world, that is prevalent on your campus. There is a major difference between knowledge of truth, understanding of the basis of that truth, and wisdom and courage in the application of that truth, and what we need is the wisdom and courage from you, Dr. Shafik, to apply the principles that you purport to stand for and to apply the truth that you just evidenced here today, and make sure that your actions follow your words today. Only time will tell whether your words here today are hollow or whether your actions are truly to follow. I yield to the gentlelady from New York, Ms. Stefanik, for the balance of my time. Ms. Stefanik. Ms. Shipman, was there an effort to get other trustees to sign a letter supporting President Shafik? Ms. Shipman. No. Ms. Stefanik. There was not. Ms. Shipman. No. Ms. Stefanik. Will you comply with all documents related to email correspondence regarding any potential letter? Ms. Shipman. We have---- Ms. Stefanik. Board members have come forward anonymously to this Committee raising the issue of a letter that was circulated, that members of the board did not sign on in support. Are you testifying today under oath that you have no knowledge of any draft letter in support of Dr. Shafik? Ms. Shipman. No knowledge whatsoever, and my understanding is we are fully complying and ready to give you whatever you need. Ms. Stefanik. Mr. Greenwald, are you aware of any letter that was circulated? Mr. Greenwald. No, that is surprising to me. Ms. Stefanik. Professor David, are you aware? Dr. Schizer. Not at all. Ms. Stefanik. My final question is there has been a lot of discussion on Columbia's putting out a statement against calling for the genocide of Jews. That statement was put out after the catastrophically, morally repugnant answers by your colleagues from MIT, Penn and Harvard; correct? That was when you put out that statement, after that hearing? Dr. Shafik. Congresswoman, you shed light on an important issue. Ms. Stefanik. I am just asking when you put it out. It was after that hearing? Dr. Shafik. It was definitely after it because frankly it seemed obvious. Ms. Stefanik. You are aware that Congress voted 377 to 44 condemning antisemitism. That is a strong bipartisan vote. Would you support that vote condemning antisemitism? Dr. Shafik. Yes. Ms. Stefanik. You are aware that in that bill that got 377 members out of 435 Members of Congress condemn ``From the River to the Sea'' as antisemitic? Dr. Shafik. Yes, I am aware of that. Ms. Stefanik. You do not believe ``from the river to the sea'' is antisemitic? Dr. Shafik. We have already issued a statement to our community saying that language is hurtful, and we would prefer not to hear it on our campus. Ms. Stefanik. You would prefer not to hear it, or is there disciplinary action taken against students of those antisemitic statements? Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you, Ms. Stefanik. Ms. Stefanik. I want an answer to that question. Dr. Shafik. Sorry, sorry. I am sorry. Can you repeat the question? Ms. Stefanik. Has there been disciplinary action taken against students who have chanted ``From the river to the sea,'' which you have testified is antisemitic and which Congress has voted that it is antisemitic? Dr. Shafik. We have some disciplinary cases ongoing around that language. We have specified that those kinds of chants should be restricted in terms of where they happen. Chairwoman Foxx. We need to wrap it up, Dr. Shafik. Dr. Shafik. We are looking at it. We are looking at it. Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you. Dr. Shafik. Sorry about that. Chairwoman Foxx. The Ranking Member is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Scott. Thank you, Madam Chair. Professor Schizer, you indicated the tension between protesting the war and antisemitism. How do you prevent gatherings from going from one to the other? Dr. Schizer. I think sir there are two things that we need to do. One is to be very clear, and the president has been, and the trustees have been, that free and open exchange is critical. The second is to make very clear, and I believe we have, that discrimination, harassment and hate are unacceptable. It is entirely appropriate for people to take a view about the war in Gaza. People can oppose it; people can support it. What you cannot do---- Mr. Scott. When you are trying to enforce student behavior on this, how would you--how would it be helpful if language in a bill that this Committee reported on a party line vote requiring a--saying a public institution may not prohibit a person, a person not a student, a person from freely engaging in non-commercial expressive activity in generally accessible areas on an institution's campus, if the person's conduct is lawful? How would you be able to deal with that? Would that be helpful in trying to keep antisemitism off campus? Dr. Schizer. I would need to study that language sir, but I will say that having a place where speech is robust and permitted is very appropriate and necessary---- Mr. Scott. This is the whole, this is the whole campus. Dr. Schizer. I would not support speech anywhere at any time. I think we need classes to take place. We do not want them to be disrupted. We need protest and we need speech just to be in the right place. Mr. Scott. Ms. Shipman, you were asked a question about what it says about the situation when this is the fourth hearing we would have to have on antisemitism. What does it say when there have been no hearings on racism, homophobia, Islamophobia or how you could make campuses safe for transgender students? Ms. Shipman. What is my thought about that? Mr. Scott. Do you think we should have had some hearings? Are those not problems? Ms. Shipman. Look, we have a specific problem right now on our campus, so I can speak from what I know, and that is rampant antisemitism. This hearing is hard and helpful for us at this moment. I certainly think, because I have heard from a lot of students on our campus and my time on the board, we would benefit from broader hearings about hate in general. As I have said, I think we have a broader societal problem that is reflected in a really divisive way on college campuses. Mr. Scott. Antisemitism is the only one we ought to be addressing, not racism, homophobia? Ms. Shipman. We certainly address all of it. We have no tolerance for any of that on our campus, but right now----- Mr. Scott. Islamophobia? How trans students--we have had hearings. During these hearings, we have had some members disparage trans students in the middle of the hearing on antisemitism. Should not we be having hearings making sure all students can be safe? Ms. Shipman. I understand that sentiment, Congressman and I have spent a significant amount of time with some of our Muslim students from the region, and their stories are also heartbreaking. I do not like that any student on our campus does not feel safe. I think what we see most routinely right now is political speech crossing the line into antisemitism, and we have, go to figure that out. Mr. Scott. We do not address the fact that black students may not feel safe? Gay students? Muslim students? Let me ask another question, Ms. Shafik. If someone says something that is antisemitic, what should the sanction be? Dr. Shafik. It depends on what they say, who they say it to, what context it is in. In any situation, we would pursue disciplinary action---- Mr. Scott. Should they always be expelled? Dr. Shafik. No. I mean I think, you know, expulsion is a very extreme act but we, you know, we are an educational institution. We have got to start by educating our students to not say certain things and change the culture, so that nobody is discriminated or harassed at all. That should be our objective. Mr. Scott. Thank you. You would try to fit the sanction with the seriousness of the crime---- Dr. Shafik. Absolutely. Mr. Scott . The context, and hopefully use it as an educational opportunity? Dr. Shafik. Agreed. Mr. Scott. Thank you, thank you. Chairwoman Foxx. I now recognize the Ranking Member for a closing statement. Mr. Scott. Thank you, Madam Chair. First, I would like to ask unanimous consent to enter into the record the article ``Columbia's Own Middle East War'' from January 19th, 2005, that provides additional nuance on the issue of professors at Columbia. Unanimous consent to enter into the record a report from the University of Chicago's Project on Security and Threats, analyzing the fear of both Jewish and Muslim students feel on campus, and how that fear often results from miscommunication. Another, I would like to enter into the record a letter from Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education to Chairwoman Foxx and myself, outlining the concerns he and the organization have with the H.R. 7683, the bill that I referenced, including the following quote: ``Given the Committee's recent focus on concerns regarding antisemitism and the need for campuses to increase their efforts to provide safe environments free from discrimination for all students, we are puzzled by the bill's inclusion of a provision that would tie the hands of campus administrators to address these issues and potentially make campuses less safe.'' Chairwoman Foxx. Without objection.   Mr. Scott. Madam Chair, we all agree that Jewish students should be entitled to a safe learning experience at all colleges. In fact, all students ought to be entitled to the same. This is the fourth hearing we've had on antisemitism. None on racism, homophobia, Islamophobia, transgender. In fact, the Office of Civil Rights budget has been cut by the Republican budget and we have reported a bill that would actually create more problems. I think the Office of Civil Rights has indicated that they get a lot more complaints from racism, homophobia, Islamophobia and trans students, and those need to also be addressed. I hope the Committee would somehow promote the safety of all students, not just one group, and I yield back. Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you, Mr. Scott. We are deeply disturbed by what we are seeing at Columbia and by many of the things we have heard in today's hearing. It is important to set the record straight on a few things. President Shafik testified there have been 15 suspensions related to antisemitic incidents. That is misleading. In fact, between October 7 and March 23, after months of antisemitic incidents, only three students were given interim suspensions for antisemitic conduct. All three were lifted or dropped to probation, including a student who repeatedly harassed students, screaming ``F the Jews.'' Of the ten suspensions that came in response to the Resistance 101, five were lifted because Columbia determined they were not involved. The only two Columbia students who remain suspended for incidents related to October 7th that took place before we called Dr. Shafik to testify are the two Jewish students suspended for spraying the odorous substance Representative Omar referred to. Dr. Shafik's testimony was misleading there too. Documents Columbia produced to the Committee show that the substance sprayed was a non-toxic gag spray. While that was an inappropriate action, for months Jewish students have been vilified with false accusations of a ``chemical attack,'' and Columbia failed to correct the record. Radical antisemitic faculty remain a huge problem throughout Columbia at the Middle Eastern Studies Department, School of Social Work, School of Public Health, Law School, and many others. Multiple Columbia Departments have been into receivership in the past 20 years. If Columbia takes this seriously, it is a remedy worth pursuing. While some changes have begun on campus, there is still a significant amount of work to be done as we have heard today. We will be looking for answers to the questions that have been raised today in a very timely fashion, and we are prepared to bring you back if we do not see more tangible progress. I thank our witnesses again for being here today. I thank all the members who have attended to help us gather the information we have gathered. Without objection, there being no further business, the Committee stands adjourned.
