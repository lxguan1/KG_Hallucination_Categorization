SECURITY RISK: THE UNPRECEDENTED SURGE IN CHINESE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ---------- Thursday, May 16, 2024 U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security, Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations, and Accountability, Washington, DC. The subcommittees met, pursuant to notice, at 2:04 p.m., in room 360, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. Dan Bishop (Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding. Present: Representatives Bishop, Ezell, Strong, Ivey, Ramirez, and Clarke. Also present: Representative Higgins, Pfluger, and Suozzi. Chairman Bishop. The Committee on Homeland Security Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations, and Accountability will come to order. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare the committee in recess at any point. The purpose of today's hearing is to investigate the recent influx of inadmissible migrants from the People's Republic of China to the United States borders. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Pfluger; the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Higgins; and the gentleman from New York, Mr. Suozzi, are permitted to sit on the dais and ask questions of the witnesses. I now recognize myself for an opening statement. Today's subcommittee hearing will examine the unprecedented numbers of Chinese foreign nationals crossing the border and whether this represents a risk to homeland security. I think we have a visual. There it is. Border Patrol records show that from 2007 to 2021, encounters of Chinese nationals illegally entering the United States at the Southwest Border were relatively rare, averaging a little over 1,000 per year. That changed dramatically under the Biden administration, rising from 1,970 in fiscal year 2022 to 24,048 in fiscal year 2023, an 1,100 percent increase. In the last 7 months, from October to April, Border Patrol has already encountered 27,496 Chinese nationals, shattering last year's total. At this pace, the full fiscal year will see encounters of illegal Chinese immigrants 2,300 percent higher than the rate just 2 years ago. This is a national security concern and it is not a new one. One year ago, the current Border Patrol Chief and then-Del Rio Sector Chief Jason Owens testified in a transcribed interview with the committee that, ``Even without the increase, people coming from the PRC would be of concern to me. That is always going to be a group we look at more closely and work with our partners, with FBI, to make sure they don't pose a threat.'' I agree that there is a serious national security concern and we should be looking closely at individuals coming from Communist China, the United States' greatest adversary on the world stage. Unfortunately, under the Biden administration, Border Patrol agents have been instructed that when processing Chinese nationals they should conduct short, basic interviews that include only generic background questions instead of in-depth interviews. In other words, there is no serious vetting. These questions simply ask about military service, education, birthplace in China, employment, and political affiliation with the CCP, while agents only proceed to an in- depth interview if one of the answers in the basic interview is flagged. It begs the question, how likely is it that someone showing up at the border is going to admit that they are here to do the bidding of the Chinese Communist Party or perhaps the People's Liberation Army? Instead, that person will likely provide the answers their smugglers told them to give Border Patrol. Just give the right answers and come right on into the homeland. These limited interviews, combined with a lack of reliable information from China to verify biographical claims and limited translation services, severely constrain CBP's ability to conduct rigorous vetting for criminal and national security concerns. One Border Patrol sector chief told the committee that it could be difficult to determine the motives of those detained who come from distant countries like China stating that, ``We try our best to figure out why they are coming but, of course, that information can be hidden, their agendas, their ideologies. The reason for them coming could be missed.'' This is especially true for got-aways, those who avoid apprehension and who reportedly pay as much as $60,000 to be smuggled illegally into the United States. Some of you may have seen some news made, I think just yesterday, finally a document emerging verifying that the number of got-aways in total is quite large, I think about 1.7 million, if I remember correctly, across the Biden administration. But among them presumably there are some number of Chinese nationals, if the numbers that are showing up at the Southwest Border is any indication. The Government has no idea who the got-aways are or why they are crossing the border and deliberately trying to avoid Border Patrol. But something tells me the motive isn't likely to be above board. Some Chinese nationals may be motivated to seek asylum on legitimate claims of persecution, such as Uyghurs from Shenzhen, but it is more likely that they come for economic reasons or other motives that do not meet the statutory requirements for asylum. Considering the Biden administration's failure to hold China to account, these Chinese nationals also know that it is very unlikely they will ever be returned to China under this administration's policies, even if ordered removed by an immigration judge. Some Chinese nationals may have more nefarious motives for coming to the United States. For example, Federal indictments in North Carolina from last month show partnerships between Mexican drug cartels and Chinese transnational criminal organizations engaged in money-laundering operations throughout the United States. This was reinforced by testimony from Federal counter-narcotics officials in a Senate hearing 2 weeks ago that Chinese criminal organizations have, ``Emerged as the professional money launderers of choice for Mexican drug traffickers.'' Recent reporting has also uncovered that Chinese-run marijuana farms are all across the United States and many of them exploit workers from China. Transnational criminal organizations and the CCP see our open border as an opportunity. This surge of Chinese nationals at our border without recent precedent presents international security vulnerability ripe for exploitation. It makes no sense that the Biden administration refuses to take common-sense steps to secure our border in the face of such obvious threats to our homeland. Instead, we get more of the same catch-and-release policies that have set the country on this dangerous course for the past 3 years and all that some can say is that the Congress should codify and institutionalize these very practices. I want to thank our witnesses for being here today, and I look forward to their testimony.

The Government has no idea who the ``gotaways'' are or why they are crossing the border and deliberately trying to avoid Border Patrol. But something tells me the motive wasn't likely to be aboveboard. Some Chinese nationals may be motivated to seek asylum on legitimate claims of persecution, such as Uyghurs from Xinjiang. But it is more likely that they come for economic reasons or other motives that do not meet the statutory requirements for asylum. And considering the Biden administration's failure to hold China to account, these Chinese nationals also know that it is very unlikely that they will ever be returned to China, under this administration's policies, even if ordered removed by an Immigration Judge.

This surge of Chinese nationals at our border without recent precedent presents a major national security vulnerability, ripe for exploitation. It makes no sense that the Biden administration refuses to take common-sense steps to secure our border in the face of such obvious threats to our homeland.

I want to thank our witnesses for being here today, and I look forward to their testimony. Chairman Bishop. Well, give me a second. I am getting to the part where I recognize you. I now recognize the Ranking Member, the gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Ivey, for his opening statement. Mr. Ivey. I was going to say that might be sufficient, just the---- Chairman Bishop. I figured there was something else in there I probably should read, but you are exactly right. That was easy enough. Mr. Ivey. Well, I thank the Chairman for that. It is May. This is the month when we typically celebrate and honor the culture, heritage, achievements, and contributions of Asian Americans, Native Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders, and I want to make sure that we honor those contributions and steer away from any kind of concerns or rhetoric with respect to--I want to make sure that our friends from the Asian communities are not mischaracterized or misunderstood by who they are and what they are doing. You know, there is a lot of rhetoric, I have got to say, that I hear. Recently, I have got, for example, despite the invasion rhetoric some Republican colleagues are spreading, it is only a tiny fraction of border crossers who are coming from China. In the first 4 months of this fiscal year less than 2 percent, 2.5 percent of border crossers were Chinese nationals. In fact, Chinese nationals are neither one of the fastest- growing nationalities apprehended along the Southwest Border nor one of the top 10 nationalities apprehended at the U.S. border. You know, I have seen and heard rhetoric that Chinese immigrants coming across the border to ``build an army.'' One statement was made without any evidence that ``it's virtually certain'' that some Chinese border crossers are spies. One Republican's comments calling Chinese immigration an invasion, and I think that is the kind of rhetoric we want to steer away from. I do think it is important to say this, that we have got people crossing the border for a variety of reasons. I think part of it is economic, as the Chairman referenced. Part of it, and we have had some hearings with respect to the Uyghurs, it is a bit ironic that this subcommittee has held hearings about that and it goes to the repression of the Uyghurs and in some instances forced labor or slave labor. I want to make sure that we keep those sorts of pressures in mind in addition to the national and international migration patterns that are in reference here. I think we should keep in mind some of the comments that the Border Patrol chiefs have made. We had recent conversations with them. Here is what they did say about Chinese border crossers. One statement, ``That specific demographic doesn't cause me concern.'' Another one, ``We treat everybody the same. It doesn't matter where they come from. It doesn't matter what your nationality is, what your religious beliefs are. We're going to treat everybody exactly the same. They run through the same screening, the same processing, the same background checks. Everything we have access to we are going to check on each and every person.'' There is another exchange, ``Question: Do you know what reasons Chinese nationals are giving in their interviews for coming? Answer: The typical reason is the same as for most migrants, for work or a better life.'' So, you know, let's keep all that stuff in mind as we sort- of work our way through this. I think a big piece of where we ought to be going is legislation. I was not a full fan of the Senate bill that was proposed a few months ago by Senator Lankford and others, but I thought it was a big step in the right direction. I was very disappointed that former President Trump essentially killed the bill, an opportunity to work on the legislation, by statements he made publicly and the adoption of those positions by the Speaker here and most of our House Republicans in general. I would say this. I mean, I know that I have had colleagues on this committee and on the Judiciary Committee raise concerns about the legislation that was proposed from the Senate, but I would just remind my colleagues that we have this amendment process here. If we bring up legislation in the committee, they can offer amendments to address it. Guess what? They are the Majority on not only both committees but on the overall floor as well, so they could adapt amendments if they wanted to. But instead of moving forward and working on this type of legislation, whether they think it needs to be amended or not, they are not bringing it up and we are focusing on other things instead. I was heartened to see that Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy stated, I think yesterday, well, it may have been earlier today, that he wants to renew the push for the bipartisan legislation that was proposed in the Senate. I think that is a great idea because it addresses some of the concerns that are underlying this particular hearing, the need for more border agents, the need to make the process work faster, the need to get more judges who can adjudicate these cases more quickly because that will help to address some of the problems that we are facing, I think, at the border and with the migration patterns. I also think that the funding piece is important. I know there are a lot of times I have heard comments that the resources don't matter, at least from my Republican colleagues, but when we get testimony from Border Patrol agents, even in this committee they always say, yes, we need more resources. We don't have enough people to cover the border. We don't have enough money to retain many of the people that we have. They leave to go do other things and get paid larger salaries for less rigorous work. We don't have as many judges as we need to handle all these cases, so I am hoping we can address those things as well. So I want to thank the panel for being here today. I look forward to your testimony and not necessarily that I am going to agree with everything or you are going to agree with everything I say or that you will even agree with each other. That is not necessarily the point. But I do appreciate the fact that, and I thank the Chairman for this, bringing in people who can shed light on what is going on down there. There is just a lot of partisanism around this and, you know, that goes with the territory. This is not only Washington, DC, but Capitol Hill. But I think we need to hit a point, and we did this with the subcommittee hearings we had with respect to the Uyghurs and I raised African, you know, countries that had forced labor going on there as well. We have shown we can do it, and I am hoping we can do that again here in this instance and ultimately find our way to legislation that can address the overall problems, not just with respect to Chinese migrants, but all of the issues at the border as well. With that, I yield back. Chairman Bishop. Thank you, Ranking Member Ivey. Other Members of the committee are reminded that opening statements may be submitted for the record. I am pleased that we have a distinguished panel of witnesses before us today to examine this topic.  Chairman Bishop. Let the record reflect that the witnesses have answered in the affirmative. Thank you. You may be seated. I would like to formally introduce you for the hearing. Mr. Simon Hankinson is a senior research fellow in the Heritage Foundation's Border Security and Immigration Center. He previously served for more than 20 years in the State Department as a foreign service officer. Mr. Craig Singleton is a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies where he also serves as senior director in the China Program. Dr. Meredith Oyen is an associate professor of history at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Mr. Todd Bensman is an author and journalist currently serving as senior national security fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies. I thank all the witnesses for being here today, and we will now hear from the witnesses to summarize your statements for 5 minutes each. I recognize Mr. Hankinson for that purpose for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF SIMON R. HANKINSON, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW, BORDER SECURITY AND IMMIGRATION CENTER, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION Mr. Hankinson. Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Ivey, Members of the committee, I served as a foreign service officer in 7 countries. I have adjudicated thousands of visa applications to facilitate lawful visits and immigration while excluding aliens who were legally inadmissible. The visa process overseas stands in total contrast to what happens at the U.S. border today. Over the past 2 years I have visited the border in Arizona, California, New York, and Texas. I saw nationals of many countries apprehended by the Border Patrol. In San Diego last March, I watched Border Patrol dropping off dozens of aliens, including Chinese, at a bus stop. Such mass release of people who entered the country illegally happens every day, multiple times at multiple locations. At best this is a mockery of U.S. immigration law and sovereignty, and at worst it is a huge national security and community safety risk. In addition to many Chinese with connections to the Communist Party, People's Liberation Army, and other state entities, it is statistically probable that DHS is releasing people with criminal records. According to U.S. law, DHS should detain aliens caught entering illegally, but the Biden administration has replaced border control with mass processing and release and they have abused immigration parole at an unprecedented scale. In January 2021, the Border Patrol encountered 17 Chinese between ports of entry. This year in January it was 3,700. I won't repeat the rest of the numbers but we are close to 50,000 already this fiscal year. Nearly all of them are being released into an asylum process that will take years to conclude and then those eventually ordered removed are unlikely to be deported because the Chinese government does not cooperate in accepting their nationals. In fact, in fiscal year 2023, ICE removed a total of 288 Chinese, leaving up to 100,000 still in the United States despite final orders of removal. Most Chinese entering the United States illegally are seeking employment. They use asylum claims to enter, to remain, and to work. Illegal immigration ebbs and flows corresponding to a risk-and-reward calculation, and the reason that Chinese are coming in great numbers today is simply because they can. The world-wide awareness of our open borders spread by social media shows them how. The Chinese have massive economic investments in Latin America. They have close ties with governments, including Brazil, Cuba, and Venezuela. They don't need visas to fly to Ecuador after which they can continue by land to the United States. Tomorrow, May 17, Air China begins direct flights from Beijing to Havana. Meanwhile, Chinese investments in the United States, both legal and illegitimate, are growing, providing many new opportunities for work. More people are on the way. Now, overseas and in-person interview by a consular officer is the first line of vetting for visa applicants. This is buttressed by staff who know local languages, customs, and news, and in larger embassies we have other Federal agencies who can assist with investigations. The second line of vetting is through automatic checks of U.S. Government databases. Applicants are frequently refused visas due to adverse information that would not have been discovered had they simply showed up at the border with no identity documents. Meanwhile at the border today, most so-called national security decisions of who gets into our country are no longer made by American officers. Under President Biden's policies, what was once a privilege has become a right. Despite what the administration wishes the public to believe, there is no real vetting of those released at the border, nor of those allowed in under parole programs, much less the got-aways who enter entirely without inspection. The official visa front door competes with a wide-open back door at the border where there are no routine criminal background checks for home country. Unless a foreign national has a record held by U.S. agencies, DHS is flying blind. Concerning China specifically, CBP agents have reportedly reduced the number of standard questions asked of inadmissible Chinese from 40 to 5, but however many the questions the process relies on an alien telling the truth. Even if CBP requests additional information on a particular individual, China routinely ignores U.S. requests for verification of nationality and they reportedly hide domestic records of criminal and corruption cases. DHS releases most aliens with a notice to appear in immigration court far in the future and they are then free to go where they want with no easy way for ICE to find them. There are more than 6 million aliens on ICE's nondetained docket and from only about 184,000 are tracked and only 2 percent of those with GPS monitors. To close this dangerous loophole the United States needs to reimplement agreements with Mexico and Central America so that inadmissible aliens are not released into the interior pending the decision in their asylum cases. Given the population, economy, and politics of China, we can never meet the demand for those seeking to enter illegally. At some point the United States will either have to remove those who are ineligible to enter or remain or else abandon the rule of law. Thank you.  Prepared Statement of Simon R. Hankinson May 16, 2024 Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Ivey, and Members of the committee, my name is Simon Hankinson. I am a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation. The views I express in this testimony are my own and should not be construed as representing any official position of The Heritage Foundation. introduction I spent 23 years as a Foreign Service officer with the Department of State, serving at U.S. diplomatic missions in 7 countries. For much of that time, I adjudicated visa cases as a consular officer or supervised others who did. I and my staff conducted interviews, investigated fraud, worked with host country law enforcement, and cooperated with other U.S. agencies to enforce immigration laws of the United States. The mission was clear: Facilitate lawful visits, commerce, and immigration while excluding those aliens who were inadmissible under our laws for a variety of reasons. Since January 2021, the Department of State's consular mission overseas that I worked 2 decades to support stands in almost total contrast to what we are seeing at the U.S. land borders, where the Biden administration oversees a de facto open border. In May 2022, I retired from the State Department. Over the past 2 years, I have visited the U.S. border at Malone, New York; McAllen, Eagle Pass, and Del Rio, Texas; Yuma, Arizona; and San Diego, California. In Arizona, Texas, and especially California, I witnessed people from China among the nationals of many countries apprehended by the Border Patrol. In San Diego, I saw several groups of Chinese men released by Border Patrol. Mass release like this of people who entered the country illegally happens nearly every day, multiple times, at multiple locations. This continuous mass release of inadmissible aliens is, at best, a mockery of U.S. immigration law, labor law, and national sovereignty. At worst, it is a national security and community safety risk of unknown proportions. In addition to Chinese nationals with connections to the Communist Party, People's Liberation Army, and other elements of the Chinese state, it is statistically likely that DHS is releasing aliens who have serious criminal records in China that are unknown to U.S. authorities. Extrapolating from recidivism rates among U.S. violent offenders after release from prison, we can be certain that the mass release of aliens who would never pass a background check will result in preventable crimes committed in the United States in future.\1\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ Simon Hankinson, Lora Ries, and Matthew Kuckelman, Backgrounder: ``Biden's Open Borders and Non-Enforcement Mean Americans Play `Recidivist Roulette' with Criminal Aliens,'' The Heritage Foundation, May 7, 2024, https://www.heritage.org/immigration/report/ bidens-open-borders-and-non-enforcement-mean-americans-play-recidivist- roulette. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Furthermore, while those inadmissible aliens arrested before being released at least have to provide biometric data that will then be permanently assigned to them, even should they attempt to change their identity in future, the ``gotaways'' who enter the United States without inspection or contact with any official do not even get that weak level of vetting. The Biden administration's continued prioritization of continued flow of illegal migration over securing the border, and DHS's resulting diversion of staff to processing aliens into the country, makes entry without inspection easier than ever. So far this year, more than 24,000 Chinese nationals have entered the United States illegally over the southwest land border.\2\ It appears nearly all are being released, into an asylum process that will take many years to conclude. At the end of that process, even those Chinese nationals denied asylum and ordered removed are extremely unlikely to be deported. The Chinese government has long been deemed ``recalcitrant,'' which is the term ICE uses for countries that are uncooperative with the U.S. Government in accepting their nationals who are ordered removed by U.S. immigration courts. ``The Chinese government . . . will accept repatriation of Chinese citizens who have been verified to be from mainland China,'' according to their Embassy in Washington.\3\ However, they do not interview and document their nationals timely and accurately when requested by ICE, as cooperative countries do (and as the United States does for its own nationals when asked). According to a 2021 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) report, ``the PRC has ignored more than 1,300 ICE requests for travel documents since October 2017. Consequently, ICE has been forced to release more than 1,000 PRC nationals from custody, many with convictions for violent or other serious crimes.''\4\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \2\ U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, ``Nationwide Encounters,'' https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/ stats/nationwide-encounters, (accessed May 10, 2024). \3\ David Noriega and Julia Ainsley, ``U.S. and China in high-level talks to deport more Chinese nationals, Mayorkas says,'' NBC News, April 5, 2024, https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/us-china-high- level-talks-deport-chinese-nationals-mayorkas-says-rcna146590. \4\ Department of Homeland Security, ``DHS Strategic Action Plan to Counter the Threat Posed by the People's Republic of China,'' January 12, 2021, https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ 21_0112_plcy_dhs-china-sap.pdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A ``DHS Strategic Action Plan to Counter the Threat Posed by the People's Republic of China,'' written at the tail end of the Trump administration, claimed that DHS ``has and will continue to augment immigration vetting and monitoring, including for student and tourist visas, and will return PRC visa-overstays who continue to undermine visa integrity.\5\ This has not been the case under the Biden administration. In fiscal year 2023, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported a total of 288 Chinese back to China.\6\ As noted in a 2019 DHS Inspector General report, some foreign embassies ``do not conduct timely interviews with detainees or notify ICE when additional information is required to facilitate travel, delaying removals.''\7\ ICE maintains a list of ``Recalcitrant'' countries that do not facilitate the repatriation of their nationals, as well as a list of countries ``At Risk of Non-Compliance.''\8\ As of 2020, China was listed as Recalcitrant. In 2016, there were over 20,000 convicted criminal alien Chinese nationals that the United States was not able to remove.\9\ In 2021, DHS reported that ``approximately 40,800 PRC nationals in the United States are subject to final orders of removal.''\10\ However, in November 2023, the New York Times quoted an anonymous Biden administration official as saying that ``Of the 1.3 million people in the United States with final orders to be deported, about 100,000 are Chinese.''\11\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \5\ DHS Strategic Action Plan to Counter the Threat Posed by the People's Republic of China. \6\ Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Annual Report, Fiscal Year 2023, Published December 29, 2023, https://www.ice.gov/doclib/eoy/ iceAnnualReportFY2023.pdf. \7\ Department of Homeland Security, Office of the Inspector General, ``ICE Faces Barriers in Timely Repatriation of Detained Aliens,'' OIG-19-28, March 11, 2019, https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/ default/files/assets/2019-03/OIG-19-28-Mar19.pdf. \8\ Congressional Research Service, ``Immigration: `Recalcitrant' Countries and the Use of Visa Sanctions to Encourage Cooperation with Alien Removals,'' July 10, 2020, https://crsreports.congress.gov/ product/pdf/IF/IF11025. \9\ Author's personal knowledge at the time. \10\ DHS Strategic Action Plan to Counter the Threat Posed by the People's Republic of China. \11\ Eileen Sullivan, ``Growing Numbers of Chinese Migrants Are Crossing the Southern Border,'' New York Times, November 24, 2023, https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/24/us/politics/china-migrants-us- border.html. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Therefore, by releasing Chinese at the border, the Biden administration is granting them de facto immigrant status with no verification of their identity and background. To restore order to the border and close this dangerous loophole, the United States needs to re-implement the Migrant Protection Protocols and Asylum Cooperative Agreements with Mexico and Northern Triangle countries so that inadmissible aliens, including Chinese asylum applicants, are not released into the interior pending the decision in their cases. The United States should also apply maximum pressure to stop Latin American countries from facilitating Chinese to transit their countries on the way to the U.S. border. For example, Ecuador allows visa-free travel for Chinese nationals, Panama allows facilities to exist that cater exclusively to Chinese migrants, and Mexico does little to impede their progress through its territory to the U.S. border. record number of chinese nationals illegally entering the u.s. by land According to U.S. law, DHS is supposed to detain all inadmissible aliens who enter the country illegally between ports of entry. Illegal immigrants detained pending removal proceedings have a high chance of being deported, while those released are likely to remain indefinitely, according the multiple DHS reports.\12\ At various times in the past, DHS has responded to surges in the number of illegal aliens encountered at the border by releasing them on their own recognizance, having placed them in removal proceedings under U.S. immigration law.\13\ Since January 2021, this tactic has become the strategic norm and has reached epic proportions. President Biden has added to the mass release policy by using the limited parole power in the Immigration and Nationality Act at an unprecedented scale and not for intended purposes.\14\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \12\ Nadwa Mossaad, Sean Leong, Ryan Baugh, and Marc Rosenblum, ``Fiscal Year 2021 Enforcement Lifecycle Report,'' U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Office of Immigration Statistics, November 2022, p. 13, https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2022-12/2022_- 1114_plcy_enforcement_lifecycle_report_fy2021.pdf (accessed October 16, 2023). \13\ Title 8 U.S. Code, Aliens and Nationality, https:// uscode.house.gov/browse/&edition=prelim (accessed October 16, 2023). \14\ Texas et al v.

In January 2024, 3 years into the Biden administration, Border Patrol encountered 3,700 Chinese--200 hundred times as many. In fiscal year 2021, DHS had 23,471 total encounters with Chinese, and only 342 of them between POEs. In fiscal year 2022, DHS had 27,756 total encounters with Chinese, 1,987 of which were between POEs. In fiscal year 2023, DHS had 52,700 total encounters with Chinese, 24,125 of which were between POEs. In fiscal year 2024 as of March 31, the Department of Homeland Security encountered 41,970 total inadmissible Chinese nationals at our borders. Twenty-four thousand, two hundred ninety-six of these were encounters by the Border Patrol between Ports of Entry (POEs), and 3,004 were encounters at POEs by Customs and Border Protection.\15\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \15\ U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, ``Nationwide Encounters,'' https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/ stats/nationwide-encounters, (accessed May 10, 2024). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- On just 1 day in April 2024 (April 24) the Border Patrol encountered 206 Chinese nationals crossing into just the San Diego sector of the Southwest Border.\16\ San Diego sector has seen explosive growth in Chinese illegally arriving by foot. In fiscal year 2021, the Border Patrol had only 75 encounters with Chinese nationals all year in San Diego sector. That rose to 942 in fiscal year 2022, 10,520 in fiscal year 2023, and they are up to 23,890 in fiscal year 2024 so far.\17\ DHS has even granted appointments to Chinese, supposedly located in Mexico, under their CBP One application for them to apply for parole after being allowed to fly into the United States or present themselves at a Port of Entry. Between January 2023 and September 30, 2023, Chinese nationals made 36 appointments on CBP One, of which 32 were granted parole.\18\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \16\ Adam Shaw, ``Border Patrol sector stops hundreds of Chinese illegal immigrants in just 2 days as numbers soar,'' Fox News, May 3, 2024, https://www.foxnews.com/politics/border-patrol-sector-stops- hundreds-chinese-illegal-immigrants-just-two-days-numbers-soar, (accessed May 10, 2024). \17\ CBP, Nationwide Encounters. \18\ U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security, News Release, October 23, 2023, https://homeland.house.gov/2023/10/23/ new-documents-obtained-by-homeland-majority-detail-shocking-abuse-of- cbp-one-app/. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In March 2024, I visited the California border in San Diego, Jacumba Hot Springs, Otay Mesa, and Imperial Beach. I spent a morning watching 2 unmarked buses chartered by the Border Patrol dropping off aliens at San Diego's Iris Avenue bus and tram stop. Single adult illegal immigrants in San Diego are released at several spots after minimal screening and assisted by NGO's, family, and friends to move further into the United States. At Iris Avenue, I saw a row of Toyota Priuses driven by Chinese men looking for compatriots to solicit. The licensed cabdrivers I spoke to--who were legal immigrants from El Salvador, Somalia, and Ecuador--told me the Chinese drivers were operating illegal taxis.\19\ There were Chinese nationals, of apparently recent arrival, selling cigarettes, internet connections, and other services to their compatriots arriving off Border Patrol buses. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \19\ Simon Hankinson, ``My Look Inside Biden's Illegal Immigrant Catch-and-Release Craziness,'' The Daily Signal, April 08, 2024, https://www.dailysignal.com/2024/04/08/my-look-inside-bidens-illegal- immigrant-catch-release-craziness-borderline/ (accessed May 10, 2024). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Border Patrol's San Diego sector is attractive to Chinese illegal crossers for several reasons. One is that the U.S. city of 1.4 million people directly extends to the border, with the Mexican city of Tijuana literally built up to the border wall (where it exists) in many places. There is no desert like in Arizona, or river as in Texas, to present even a small natural obstacle. In addition, San Diego's public transit, the county's network of non-governmental organizations, and the sanctuary policies of California all facilitate easy entry and dispersal.\20\ Given the many gaps in the border wall, and daily breaches of the wall by alien smugglers in Mexico, there is no real impediment to the mass movement of people into the United States in this sector. Furthermore, in the words of former Border Patrol chief Rodney Scott, ``there's no real response from the Federal Government of the United States to slow it down. There hasn't been since 2021.''\21\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \20\ Virginia Allen, ``6 Reasons Chinese Nationals Are Illegally Crossing California's Southern Border,'' The Daily Signal, April 28, 2024, https://www.dailysignal.com/2024/04/28/6-reasons-chinese- nationals-illegally-crossing-californias-southern-border/, (accessed May 10, 2024). \21\ Allen, Ibid. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- why chinese come illegally to the u.s. border Push Factors: Economic and Political Drivers A recent Wilson Center article by Joshua Peng attributes the reasons Chinese leave China, often with the intent of remaining in another country via an asylum claim, to ``fears of President Xi Jinping's authoritarian rule and the experience of draconian zero-COVID policies'' and ``skepticism of the Chinese economy and fears of eventually being cast into poverty.''\22\ A change to the Chinese constitution in 2018 allowed Xi Jinping a third Presidential term, removed time limits on his staying in power, and strengthened his control as China's leader.\23\ After 2020, China's zero-COVID policy forced testing, vaccines, and lockdowns, enforced by surveillance state and sometimes violence.\24\ However, whatever the individual motivations for leaving, it should be noted that absent political persecution by the government of the applicant himself, none of the above reasons would qualify an applicant for asylum in the United States. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \22\ Joshua Peng, ``Through the Darien Gap: A New Path for Chinese Asylum Seekers to the United States,'' The Wilson Center, March 20, 2024, https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/through-darien-gap-new-path- chinese-asylum-seekers-united-states#:?:text=Over%2015%2C500- %20Chinese%20migrants%20were,40%20times%20that%20of%202021. \23\ Chris Buckley and Steven Lee Myers, ``China's Legislature Blesses Xi's Indefinite Rule.

The Biden policy is to ``significantly expand lawful pathways for protection, and facilitate the safe, orderly, and humane processing of migrants.''\28\ The result has been predictable: The easier it appears to be to enter the United States and be allowed to remain and work, the more people come. DHS has reported over 150,000 people at the border every month attempting to enter the United States illegally since January 2021.\29\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \27\ ``Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection,'' The White House, June 10, 2022, https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/ statements-releases/2022/06/10/los-angeles-declaration-on-migration- and-protection/ (accessed October 16, 2023). \28\ Department of Homeland Security, ``Fact Sheet: U.S. Government Announces Sweeping New Actions to Manage Regional Migration,'' April 27, 2024, https://www.dhs.gov/news/2023/04/27/fact-sheet-us-government- announces-sweeping-new-actions-manage-regional-migration. \29\ U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, ``Nationwide Encounters,'' https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/ stats/nationwide-encounters, (accessed May 10, 2024). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Biden administration's ``root causes'' approach has not reduced illegal immigration flows as allegedly intended. Neither has its ``Comprehensive Plan to Manage the Border After Title 42.''\30\ The intention of the Rule was to expedite the removal of those who were less likely to qualify for asylum and who had not taken advantage of the administration's new parole programs using the CBP One application. However, as was widely predicted from the beginning, the Rule's wide exceptions, including for families and certain nationalities, have made it nearly useless. Even with the new Rule's demonstrable failure to reduce the flow of inadmissible aliens crossing the border, the administration's default position remained to let in as many aliens as could be processed and nominally put them into the backlogged asylum system. In most cases, illegal border crossers are released without any way to track them or ensure that they attended scheduled court appearances.\31\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \30\ ``Fact Sheet: Biden-Harris Administration Announces New Border Enforcement Actions,'' The White House, January 5, 2023, https:// www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/05/fact- sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-border-enforcement- actions/ (accessed October 16, 2023). \31\ Simon Hankinson, `` `Alternatives to Detention' for Illegal Aliens: Effective with Mandatory Tracking for Entire Process,'' Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 3767, May 12, 2023, https:// www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/2023-05/BG3767_0.pdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In addition to this ``catch and release'' standard, the administration has redirected tens of thousands of illegal aliens whom the Border Patrol would have ``encountered''--that is, administratively arrested--crossing between ports of entry by inventing and expanding programs to allow inadmissible aliens to enter the United States on immigration parole.\32\ They are paroled on the premise that they are refugees fleeing persecution who will apply for asylum rather than economic migrants.

China has been investing in development, commercial, transportation, military, and space projects throughout Latin America. Since 2005, China loaned more than $140 billion to Latin American countries including Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, and Venezuela. Eleven countries in Latin America-- Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Panama, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela--have signed onto China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a world-wide transportation network financed and often built by China.\35\ The Chinese government has close ties with socialist and leftist governments across Latin America--in particular, economic giant Brazil, close U.S. neighbor Cuba, and oil-rich Venezuela. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \35\ John Polga-Hecimovich, ``China's evolving economic footprint in Latin America,'' Geopolitical Intelligence Services AG, November 22, 2022, https://www.gisreportsonline.com/r/chinas-economic-power-grows- in-latin-america/. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Easier Travel to Latin America and the United States Under the Biden administration, Chinese nationals, like people from 180 other countries, come in increasing numbers simply because they can. World-wide awareness of our open border, spread by family, friends, and alien-smuggling criminals using social media, is the real ``root cause'' of the mass rush to the border since January 2021, according to journalists who have spoken with prospective illegal immigrants to the United States from many countries along the Panama- Mexico route.\36\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \36\ Todd Bensman, Overrun: How Joe Biden Unleashed the Greatest Border Crisis in U.S. History (Nashville: Bombardier Books, 2023). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Chinese do not need a visa to fly to Ecuador, which has become a major entry point for them into Latin America. On May 17, Air China will begin direct flights from Beijing to Havana, with a stopover in Madrid, to increase tourism according to the official announcement.\37\ From Ecuador, many Chinese migrants headed for the United States cross through Colombia, the Darien Gap, and through Central America to Mexico and the U.S. border. According to Peng, ``over 15,500 Chinese migrants were counted in Panama after traversing . . . the Darien Gap'' in the first 9 months of 2023, which is 40 times the number that took this route in 2021.\38\ U.S. visitors to the Darien Gap report camps and infrastructure exclusively catering to Chinese illegal migrants. Author Brett Weinstein described ``a kind of hostility'' from Chinese migrants when he attempted to ask them about their journey, saying they ``seemed interested in deliberately misleading us as to their origin and purpose.''\39\ Voice of America interviews of Chinese who had crossed the Gap indicated economic motives as paramount in their decision to leave China and trek to the U.S. border.\40\ There are reports that others pay extra to bypass the Darien Gap by taking sea transport from Ecuador further north.\41\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \37\ ``Air China will start direct Beijing-Havana flights on May 17,'' Prensa Latina, April 12, 2024, https://www.plenglish.com/news/ 2024/04/12/air-china-will-start-direct-beijing-havana-flights-on-may- 17/. \38\ Peng.

Meanwhile, Chinese social media informs them of the logistics, including how to give themselves up to U.S. Border Patrol once they have entered the United States.\43\ According to the Asia Society, the social media app Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok, also owned by parent company ByteDance) recently banned the word ``zouxian'' (``walk the line'') from search results. That term, and others, is a euphemism for illegal migration out of China including into the United States. According to analyst Lynette Ong of the Center for Chinese Analysis, ``Douyin's censorship was likely the result of pressure from Chinese authorities embarrassed by the magnitude of the exodus'' of Chinese who use Douyin to guide them on their journey to Latin America and north to the U.S. border.\44\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \42\ Peng, Ibid. \43\ Author's conversation with Michael Cunningham, Research Fellow, The Heritage Foundation. \44\ Lynette Ong, ``Douyin Censors Migrant Searches,'' Asia Society Policy Institute, China 5 Newsletter, May 10, 2024. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Chinese Immigration After 1965 It was difficult for Chinese to enter the United States until the Immigration Act of 1965, which began the modern era of mass immigration into the United States. The majority of immigrants to the United States now come now from Latin America, Asia, and Africa rather than Europe as in the previous 3 centuries. In 1993, some Chinese were prepared to pay up to $30,000 each for passage by sea and even to be smuggled in shipping containers.\45\ The flows from China have ebbed and flowed over the years, corresponding to the risk-reward calculation of spending thousands of dollars on alien smuggling services compared to the chance of being allowed into the United States to work and live indefinitely. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \45\ Morning Edition, ``Finding An Anchor For A Life Set Adrift By A Shipwreck,'' National Public Radio, June 7, 2024, https:// www.npr.org/2013/06/07/189222117/finding-an-anchor-for-a-life-set- adrift-by-a-shipwreck. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Chinese nationals have been able to find black market, illegal employment for generations in the U.S. informal service industries, particularly in the bigger cities' ``Chinatowns.'' Today, there are also opportunities in rural areas, where Chinese investors and criminal syndicates are systematically buying land.

Today, China's enormous economic growth provides more opportunities for the PRC to influence U.S. politics through its diaspora. To cite one example, the National Review recently reported on Chinese-American John Chan's ``constellation of nonprofit organizations and businesses'' which, along with his connections with the Chinese government and New York State politicians, he reportedly uses to advocate for positions favored by the People's Republic of China.\52\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \52\ Jimmy Quinn, ``New Player in Chinese Communist Influence Body Has Extensive NYC Political Ties,'' National Review, May 10, 2024, https://www.nationalreview.com/2024/05/new-player-in-chinese-communist- influence-body-has-extensive-nyc-political-ties/. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- who are they? identifying and vetting chinese legal and illegal immigrants ``Vetting'' in Consular Visa Operations Twenty-five years ago on the visa line in New Delhi, I would interview at least 150 visa applicants a day and enter my decision into a computerized non-immigrant visa (NIV) system. With reference to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), my job was to decide whether each applicant qualified for a visa. After 9/11, the State Department used to tell adjudicating officers that ``every visa decision is a national security decision.'' If an applicant did not qualify under the law, we did not issue a visa. The most common reason for denial was under INA s.214(b), which in brief requires every alien to prove to the consular officer that he is going to the United States for the purpose stated, and that he has a home outside the United States to which he intended to return. There are also many reasons a person can be ineligible from getting a visa under the INA, mostly under s.212, including criminal offences, public health concerns, and previous immigration violations. This personal consular interview is the first line of ``vetting'' for foreign visa applicants. The second line of vetting is through automatic checks of U.S. databases containing holdings from across government agencies. Names, dates of birth, and other facts are run through the Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS) maintained by the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs. This system pulls data from Federal agencies that in turn have data from State and local law enforcement, such that if a foreigner has a criminal or other adverse history in the United States, they are likely to be flagged for further review before a visa is issued. Visa applicants must also provide photographs and all 10 fingerprints (if available). These are confirmed by embassy or consular staff and the interviewing consular officer and then run through facial recognition and fingerprint databases to see if there are any matches. Adverse results are addressed by the interviewing or adjudicating consular officer before they make a decision. It is quite common to find applicants with false names and dates of birth, even with legitimately-issued foreign passports, because their other identities can be compared to bio-data databases. Fingerprints don't change, and facial recognition is always improving. Although visa applicants do not have to supply criminal records clearances from their national police agency, which is a requirement for immigrant visas, they are required to attest on a signed form that they have no criminal record and no other ineligibility. Embassies and consulates have local and American staff trained in anti-fraud measures. Consular staff know local languages, accents, customs, news, and other country-specific factors that can help prevent applicants from lying successfully in their visa applications. Larger embassies host various Federal agencies, including elements of DHS and other Federal law enforcement, who have local contacts with their counterparts through whom they can investigate cases of concern. Unfortunately, the Biden administration appears unwilling to support the State Department's foreign efforts by investigating and prosecuting visa fraud in national security cases. Even before the Biden administration canceled the Justice Department's China initiative in 2022, apparently on the grounds that it was racially biased,\53\ it began dropping fraud charges \54\ against alleged Chinese military personnel accused of falsifying visa applications.\55\ It appears that the Justice Department's National Security Division has not prosecuted any new China-related visa fraud cases since February, 2021, even though multiple visa fraud cases begun by the Trump administration resulted in convictions.\56\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \53\ U.S. Department of Justice, Remarks by Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen on Countering Nation-State Threats, Wednesday, February 23, 2022, https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant- attorney-general-matthew-olsen-delivers-remarks-countering-nation- state-threats. \54\ Jane Lee, ``U.S. dials back probe of Chinese scientists on visa fraud charges,'' Reuters, July 23, 2021, https://www.reuters.com/ world/us/us-seeks-dismiss-charges-visa-fraud-cases-chinese-researchers- 2021-07-23/. \55\ U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Public Affairs, Press Release, ``Researchers Charged with Visa Fraud After Lying About Their Work for China's People's Liberation Army,'' Thursday, July 23, 2020, https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/researchers-charged-visa-fraud-after- lying-about-their-work-china-s-people-s-liberation-army. \56\ U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Public Affairs, Press Release, ``Chinese Government Employee Convicted of Participating in Conspiracy to Defraud the United States and Fraudulently Obtain U.S. Visas,'' Wednesday, March 23, 2022, https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/ chinese-government-employee-convicted-participating-conspiracy-defraud- united-states-and. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Still, although vetting of foreign visa applicants is by no means foolproof, it is multi-layered and frequently results in visa refusals based on adverse information that would not have been discovered had the person simply arrived illegally, with no identity documents, at the U.S. border. vetting by dhs at the border After 2021, most ``national security decisions'' of who gets into our country are no longer made by American officers. Under President Biden's border policies, what was a privilege has become a right. The United States has outsourced the decision on who gets in at the border to foreign nationals based on who simply shows up in person, or who applies to enter the United States and ask for parole using CBP One. We still have a visa system overseas, but this expensive official ``front door'' competes with a wide-open back door at the Southern Border, where DHS releases most of them into the interior after minimal processing. There are no fees, no forms, and no way to routinely verify a given name, age, and identity. Worst of all, there are no criminal background checks in the person's home country or anywhere they pass through. DHS mostly takes an individual's given information on trust. While the majority of those arriving illegally are economic migrants who will claim asylum to be allowed to remain and work, ``There is a realistic probability that some Chinese nationals illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border have ties to Chinese intelligence, using U.S. border vulnerabilities for espionage,'' according to private intelligence analyst Grey Dynamics.\57\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \57\ Betselot Dejene, ``Chinese Espionage Threat at the US-Mexico Border,'' Grey Dynamics, May 11, 2024, https://greydynamics.com/ chinese-espionage-threat-at-the-us-mexico-border/. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In January 2024, the Daily Caller reported that the Biden administration has ``drastically simplified the vetting process for Chinese illegal immigrants'' started in April 2023, based on a source at U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).\58\ According to information obtained by the Daily Caller, CBP agents including Border Patrol were instructed to reduce the number of standard questions asked of inadmissible Chinese from 40 to 5. This approach is in line with the Biden administration's overall policy of processing in as many inadmissible aliens as possible, prioritizing maximum flow over vetting. A former Government official told the Daily Caller that Chinese arrested at the border are well-coached on how to answer these questions, so as to be released soonest. From my own experience with visa interviews and investigating consular fraud in several countries, I know that alien smugglers include training on how to answer interview questions from American officials in their package deals. Such training is designed to avoid further investigation into the inadmissible alien's background, while maximizing chances for a successful, if fraudulent, asylum claim. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \58\ Philip Lenczycki, ``Biden Admin Watered Down Vetting Process For Chinese Illegal Immigrants, Email Shows,'' The Daily Caller, January 2, 2024, https://dailycaller.com/2024/01/02/biden-admin-cbp- chinese-illegal-migrants/?utm_medium=push&utm_source=daily_caller- &utm_campaign=push. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Like the ``Security and Background Information'' questions on the DS-160 visa application,\59\ the questions asked by CBP interviewers of inadmissible aliens at the border are intended to find out whether they have a criminal record; any connections to the military, government, or political parties; and other information useful to determine whether they pose a security threat before they are released. Answering ``yes'' to any of the security questions would lead to further enquiry and detention pending the results. As the email obtained by the Daily Caller reads, ``If there is a Yes to any of the above  they are then referred and transported to  for an in-depth interview by Tactical Terrorism Response Team.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \59\ U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, ``Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application DS-160,'' p.68, https://travel.state.gov/ content/dam/visas/PDF-other/DS-160-Example- _11-19-2020.pdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- But whether 40 questions or 5, the process essentially relies on an illegal alien at the border telling the truth for his criminal past, membership in a totalitarian party, or terrorist affiliations to be discoverable, absent U.S. records on that individual. CBP says their ``multi-layered border security efforts include various screening and vetting processes that work to detect and prevent individuals who pose national security or public safety risks from entering the United States.''\60\ In fact, they have very limited means of verifying identify documents, statements, and any other information proffered by Chinese inadmissible aliens at the border before releasing them. China is hardly helpful in this regard, unless they have their own reasons for wanting a particular individual detained or returned to China. China routinely ignores U.S. requests for verification of nationality of even dangerous criminals. According to the State Department's Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 2022, ``corruption remained rampant'' in China.\61\ The Department's 2023 Report removed that phrase for some reason but did report that ``in general very few details were made public regarding the process by which CCP and government officials were investigated for corruption.''\62\ In addition, according to the human rights NGO Safeguard Defenders, China's ``criminal justice data continues to be culled from official reports and the main database,'' their research indicating that more than ``85,000 verdicts from criminal judgments spanning 2013 to 2020  removed'' in the last year.\63\ China's reluctance to publish, much less share, information about corrupt officials and criminals makes it very unlikely that CBP's vetting, however ``multilayered,'' does much good at discovering the true backgrounds of inadmissible aliens before they are released. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \60\ Philip Lenczycki, Daily Caller. \61\ U.S. Department of State, 2022 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, ``China (Includes Hong Kong, Macau, and Tibet),'' Section 4, https://www.state.gov/reports/2022-country-reports-on-human-rights- practices/china/. \62\ U.S. Department of State, 2023 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, ``China (Includes Hong Kong, Macau, and Tibet),'' Section 4, https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-country-reports-on-human-rights- practices/china/. \63\ Safeguard Defenders, ``Prosecutions abandoned, conviction rate record high, and more on China's judiciary 2022,'' https:// safeguarddefenders.com/en/blog/prosecutions-abandoned-conviction-rate- record-high-and-more-china-s-judiciary-2022, (accessed May 13, 2024). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Acting CBP Commissioner Troy Miller admitted the obvious in testimony before the House Appropriations Committee on May 4 that DHS releases people without confirming ID.\64\ When asked by Rep.

A Notice to Appear is a letter given to an alien by the Border Patrol or other agents of the DHS informing the subject that under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) ``you are an alien present in the United States without being admitted or paroled, or who arrived at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General,'' and ordering the subject to appear before an immigration judge \65\ at a specified time and place.\66\ This hearing begins immigration proceedings to remove them from the United States for being here illegally.

In the mean time, only a small minority of released aliens are under any kind of monitoring under Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program.\67\ There are more than 6 million aliens on ICE's Non-Detained Docket (NDD), meaning aliens in immigration proceedings such as deportation or asylum claims. As of April 20, 2024, ICE was monitoring only 184,318 of this population using ATD.\68\ As of April 2023, only 2% of the aliens monitored under ATD were tracked with GPS monitors worn by the alien, with more than 91% tracked using methods that required the alien to actively participate by using a smart phone facial recognition application or calling a dedicated phone number.\69\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \67\ Simon Hankinson, `` `Alternatives to Detention' for Illegal Aliens: Effective with Mandatory Tracking for Entire Process,'' Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 3767, May 12, 2023, https:// www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/2023-05/BG3767_0.pdf. \68\ TRAC Immigration, ``Immigration Detention Quick Facts, https:/ /trac.syr.edu/immigration/quickfacts/, (accessed May 10, 2024). \69\ Hankinson, ``Alternatives to Detention''. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- When I visited San Diego in March 2024, I witnessed the release of dozens of aliens from at least 15 countries. From my observations, GPS tracking devices, in the form of anklets, were being worn by people from Eastern Europe and Central Asia (Chechnya, Russia, Kazakhstan) but not Africa, China, India, or Latin America. I have also personally inspected several NTAs given to aliens released at the border in Arizona, California, and Texas. On these, the locations for the alien's scheduled immigration hearing may be nowhere near the alien's intended destination in the United States. For example, one Indian released in San Diego in March 2024 told me he was going to live with his uncle in Indiana, but he had a court date in May 2024 in Van Nuys, California, which is 2,085 miles away. Without a drivers' license or any identification documents, it is difficult to see how he and other aliens will be able to make the journey of hundreds of miles to attend all of the hearings in their removal proceedings. In March 2023, I visited a gap in the unfinished border wall near the Morelos Dam in Yuma. President Biden ordered all work on the wall to stop shortly after taking office. The Morelos Gap is one of many places in Arizona where the border is, for most intents and purposes, wide open. People of unknown identity from anywhere in the world can simply walk up and come in. Under Secretary of Homeland Security Mayorkas, the illegal arrivals are met by the Border Patrol or whatever DHS elements are available and channeled into a system that is designed to get them into the interior of the United States as fast as possible. Diverting DHS staff, including Border Patrol, from regular duty to providing administrative and social services leaves the border less guarded than usual, allowing even more illegal drugs, people, and goods into the country. At 3 o'clock a.m., I witnessed more than 100 people walking or running through the Gap to join a long line to be ``processed.'' I spoke to or saw people from Cameroon, China, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Georgia, India, and Russia. When asked, the people in line told me they were here to look for work and opportunity. They get in with no application, no fee, no criminal background check, and none of the other inconveniences of having to qualify for a visa as our law requires before asking to be admitted into the United States. conclusion Despite what the Biden administration wishes the American public to believe, there is no serious ``vetting'' of populations released at the U.S. border under Title 8 removal proceedings, nor of those allowed in under parole programs, much less the ``gotaways'' who enter without inspection. Unless a foreign national released or paroled has an existing record from previous time spent in the United States or a foreign record held by U.S. agencies for some other reason, DHS has no routine way of checking anyone's background for criminal records, terrorist affiliation, membership in a hostile foreign government agency, or other concern. DHS also has no way to confirm the name, date of birth, or any other information proffered by an applicant unless that person has been encountered by a U.S. law enforcement agency before. With up to 10 million people released or allowed to illegally enter the United States since January 2021, there is a considerable potential risk of espionage, crime, or other hostile action from some individuals in this population. The solution to the problem of growing illegal immigration is the same from the Biden administration on the U.S. political Left as it is for the Libertarians at the other extreme--eliminate illegal immigration by re-defining it as legal through so-called ``lawful pathways'' like parole; expanding Temporary Protected Status, Prosecutorial Discretion, Deferred Enforcement, and other tricks to avoid carrying out the intent of U.S. immigration law; releasing illegal aliens into interminable, theoretical ``removal'' proceedings under Title 8; and increasing the overall number of temporary and permanent visas for workers and students. But even were it politically acceptable to do, no amount of U.S. expansion would ever meet the demand given the population, economy, and politics of China. Whatever the upper limits on overall numbers, the United States will at some point need to police its borders and remove those who are ineligible to enter or remain here under the law. Most importantly, those who are deliberately paroled or released must be identified, and their backgrounds vetted, more seriously than at present. The nationals of all countries present risks of criminal pasts and thus predictable rates of recidivism. But nationals of countries hostile to U.S. interests like China, Iran, Russia, and others, require extra scrutiny. Chairman Bishop. Thank you. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Singleton for 5 minutes for his opening statement. STATEMENT OF CRAIG SINGLETON, SENIOR FELLOW, FOUNDATION FOR DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACIES Mr. Singleton. Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Ivey, and distinguished Members of this committee, thanks for the opportunity to testify about how the Chinese Communist Party stands to exploit America's border crisis to further its strategic interests and undermine U.S. national security. All told, the dramatic increase in Chinese nationals seeking to illegally enter the United States has reached unprecedented levels. Today's surge is not simply a matter of immigration though. It is a multifaceted menace that mires our border management systems and magnifies major national security risks. The drivers of today's surge are complex. Economic instability and political repression within China have propelled many Chinese to seek better lives abroad, yet this migration is also facilitated by sophisticated Chinese smuggling networks, readily accessible through Chinese social media platforms like WeChat and Douyin, China's version of TikTok. These and other platforms provide prospective migrants with detailed step-by-step guidance about how to enter our country illegally, as well as facilitate direct connections with human traffickers. Given that context, the security implications of today's border surge are profound and worthy of further inquiry. For starters, the influx provides cover for Chinese intelligence operatives or those acting on their behalf to potentially infiltrate our borders. These operatives benefit from newfound operational flexibility insomuch as instability at the border allows them to evade traditional screening procedures at other American ports of entry. Furthermore, their diversification of tradecraft, using everything from false documentation to exploiting vulnerabilities in our border screening protocols, equips these individuals with a varied arsenal designed to overwhelm our defenses. Adding to these concerns are China's national security laws, including its 2017 national intelligence law and recently-revised counterespionage law which require all Chinese citizens and organizations to support state intelligence activities. Coupled with China's well-documented history of conducting extraterritorial operations in the United States and elsewhere, these Chinese laws pose a significant threat, turning innocent individuals into tools of espionage under immense pressure from China's government. Amidst this orchestrated chaos Chinese transnational criminal organizations are also ruthlessly exploiting our border vulnerabilities, fueling the fentanyl crisis that claims thousands of American lives each year, showcasing a sinister blend of state-sponsored subterfuge and underworld criminality. Beyond the clear security risks, China is also skillfully exploiting today's chaos to depict the United States as a faltering democracy incapable of securing its borders. This narrative, projected globally, not only diminishes our international standing but also bolsters China's robust efforts to undermine Western democratic values. All the while, China's government remains intent on obscuring the reality that its own citizens are fleeing China in search of freedom and opportunity elsewhere. In response to these threats we must not only do more to secure our borders, but also strengthen our diplomatic ties and enhance our technological capabilities. These efforts should be complemented by targeted legislative actions that provide the necessary tools and resources to combat these threats effectively. A coordinated response must include everything from enhancing our border security infrastructure, improving interagency collaboration, and boosting our intelligence capabilities to preempt and dismantle the networks facilitating these illegal migration flows. Washington must also intensify its public diplomacy and counterpropaganda efforts to correct Beijing's misleading narratives. Such work is particularly important in light of a recent speech Chinese Communist Party Chairman Xi Jinping delivered to party elites in which he remarked, ``The most important characteristic of the world is in a word chaos, and this trend appears likely to continue.'' In that seems speech Xi Jinping noted, ``The times and trends are on our side.'' As we consider these and other measures let us remember that the stakes are exceptionally high. The integrity of our borders, the safety of our citizens, including Asian Americans and Chinese Americans, and the stability of our global standing are all intertwined with how we handle this growing crisis. I look forward to working together in developing bipartisan solutions that not only address the current challenges we face but also reinforce our national resilience against all forms of geopolitical manipulation and repression. On behalf of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, I thank you again for inviting me to testify today.   Chairman Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Singleton. I now recognize Dr. Oyen for 5 minutes for an opening statement. STATEMENT OF MEREDITH OYEN, PH.D., ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, DEPARTMENT OF HISTORY, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, BALTIMORE COUNTY Ms. Oyen. Thank you, Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Ivey, and the Members of the subcommittee for the invitation to share some historical context to the current increased levels of Chinese immigration. My name is Meredith Oyen, I am an associate professor of history at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, as well as the director of the Asian Studies program there. My research centers on the role that migrants play in the relationship between the United States and China with particular focus on the period since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949. Recent Chinese history does provide some explanations for the demographics in increased numbers of Chinese migrants on the Southern Border. Motivations for Chinese migrants crossing the Southern Border include the slowing Chinese economy and tightening political control under President Xi Jinping. The pandemic and China's lengthy zero-COVID policy had important effects on the Chinese national economy that led to slower growth and increased discontent. Migrants who have talked and been interviewed at the border have cited the difficulty finding jobs and the impact of the pandemic on small business. Migrants also cite the tightening political control by President Xi Jinping that has led to political repression, police visits after making statements critical of the CCP or Chinese government, and a lack of freedom as reasons for leaving China. Specifically in the last decade, increasing persecution of Chinese Christians and Muslims, along with limitations on the exercise of their faith, has led some Chinese to leave the country. The crackdowns against protests in Hong Kong and the new national security law implemented in 2020 has also led to the flight of former Hong Kong residents. The end of the zero-COVID policy in December 2022 permitted more Chinese nationals to travel abroad than had been able to since the beginning of the pandemic. Modern information sharing through social media and on-line platforms has provided information about crossing the U.S. Southern Border. As the number of people who cross successfully into the United States increase and they share their experiences, more individuals looking for a viable path follow in their footsteps. Recent reports have highlighted the demographics of the Chinese migrants. I wanted to add that before 1965 migration to the United States was dominated by men traveling alone. This was a result of the Page Act of 1875 which curtailed the migration of women and cultural traditions in China that made the international migration a risk only undertaken by men. More recently, unauthorized Chinese migration through container shipping, such as the Golden Venture incident that made headlines in the 1990's, was also dominated by men traveling alone. Like their predecessors, these men were not necessarily single, but they were traveling solo hoping to pave the way for families that followed. Chinese immigrants, especially unauthorized immigrants, have long fallen under suspicion of having dangerous motives or being potential spies for a hostile foreign power. The Chinese became the first and only nation to be singled out in U.S. immigration law with the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act. The anti-Chinese movement that precipitated the act cited Chinese migration as a unique threat to the United States. These fears led to extreme violence against Chinese immigrants, including mob violence and the burning of Chinatowns. After 1949, Chinese nationals in the United States and visa applicants in Hong Kong faced suspicion and harassment from U.S. authorities concerned about the national security risk they posed. U.S. Counsel Everett Drumright warned that the history of unauthorized entry and particularly the history of lying about identities and lying about their background information meant the entire population was rife for opportunities for spying for the newly Communist government. The search for spies among Chinese immigrants and the Chinese American community had a chilling effect, and the community in the United States had and faced increased harassment and discrimination with no real evidence of spying being found. During the 1990's, Taiwanese-American scientist Wen Ho Lee was arrested and held for over a year over espionage charges that never had enough clear evidence of a crime to bring charges against him. During the COVID pandemic there were many documented instances of suspicion, harassment, and violence against Chinese Americans as their race and ethnicity became associated with the source of the pandemic that caused such significant economic and personal harm. Historically, there have been many examples of a impact of suspicion, broad suspicion targeted specifically at Chinese Americans that have had detrimental effects for the community that is otherwise a very productive and useful community in the United States. Thank you.  Prepared Statement of Meredith Oyen Thursday, May 14, 2024, 2 o'clock PM ET Thank you to the subcommittee for the invitation to share my knowledge of this situation. My name is Meredith Oyen. I am an associate professor of history at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. At UMBC, I am also the director of the Asian Studies Program. My research centers on the role that migrants play in the relationship between the United States and China, with particular focus on the period since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Today I am happy to be here to offer some historical context for the issue of Chinese nationals crossing into the United States on the Southern Border, a topic I have recently written about for the on-line publication The Conversation.\1\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ ``Chinese Migration to US is Nothing New--But the Reasons for Recent Surge at Southern Border Are,'' The Conversation (March 11, 2024), https://theconversation.com/chinese-migration-to-us-is-nothing- new-but-the-reasons-for-recent-surge-at-southern-border-are-223530. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As with many other nationalities, there is a long history of unauthorized Chinese migrants coming to the United States. What has drawn significant attention recently is the extent to which this migration is coming over the Southern Border, and coming via a route that begins in South America and continues through the Darien Gap. This route for entry into the United States is dangerous for the migrants undertaking it. But in 2023 there was a marked increase in the numbers of Chinese nationals coming this way. In this statement, I hope to address some of the reasons for this increase, as well as offer some context for it in the larger patterns of Chinese migration. According to Pew Research, as of 2021 there were approximately 375,000 unauthorized Chinese immigrants in the United States.\2\ That is a small percentage of the more than 5 million ethnic Chinese who reside in the United States. The most common paths for unauthorized Chinese immigrants to enter the United States in recent decades has been by overstaying a lawful tourist, business, or student visa. Visa approval rates for Chinese nationals applying to visit the United States temporarily have been high in recent decades.\3\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \2\ Jeffrey S. Passel and Jens Manuel Korgstad, ``What we know about unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S.,'' Pew Research Center (Nov. 16, 2023), https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/11/16/ what-we-know-about-unauthorized-immigrants-living-in-the-us/ #:?:text=The%20largest%20increases%20were%20from,India%20(725%2C000). \3\ In fiscal year 2023 a total of 417,008 Nonimmigrant Visas were issued to nationals from China. In the same year, the B visa refusal rate was at 26.62 percent, down from fiscal year 2022 and the fiscal year 2021 spike of 79.09 percent. That said, the current refusal rate is much higher than it was a decade prior, when it was 8.5 percent in fiscal year 2023. See Visa Waiver Program Refusal Data at U.S. Department of State--Bureau of Consular Affairs, https:// travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-statistics/ nonimmigrant-visa-statistics/nonimmigrant-b-visa-adjusted-refusal- rates-by-nationality.html. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- For some migrants, however, the wait for a visa can be long, or the outcome uncertain. In these cases, there is a clear upward trend of Chinese nationals following many other nationalities in making use of the established routes through the Americas to reach the Southern Border of the United States. Based on recent media reports, motivations for Chinese migrants crossing the Southern Border include the slowing Chinese economy and tightening political control under President Xi Jinping. The pandemic and China's lengthy ``Zero-Covid'' policy had important effects on the Chinese national economy that has led to slower growth and increased.\4\ Migrants who have talked to reporters at the border have cited the difficulty finding jobs and the impact of the pandemic on small businesses.\5\ The tightening political control by President Xi Jinping is visible both through the unprecedented third term for Xi as Party Secretary that was decided in the Twentieth Party Congress in October 2022 as well as the recent sessions of the National People's Congress.\6\ Migrants often cite political repression, police visits after making critical statements of the CCP or Chinese government, and a lack of freedom as reasons for leaving China.\7\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \4\ Elaine Kurtenbach and Zen Soo, ``China's Economy is forecast to slow sharply in 2024, the World Bank says, calling recovery `fragile,' '' AP (Dec. 14, 2023), https://apnews.com/article/china-economy- property-adb-791934f7f9b83de455e8f8aa7178b628; Haizheng Li and Xiangyuan Li, ``The Covid-19 Pandemic's Impact on the Chinese Economy,'' China Currents 22.1 (2023), https://www.chinacenter.net/ 2023/china-currents/22-1/the-covid-19-pandemics-impact-on-the-chinese- economy/#:?:text=The%20unprecedented%20pandemic%20hindered%20consumer,- dropped%20into%20the%203%25%20range. \5\ Sharyn Alfonsi, ``Chinese Migrants are the Fastest Growing Group Crossing from Mexico into U.S. at Southern Border,'' CBS News (Feb. 4, 2024), https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chinese-migrants-fastest- growing-group-us-mexico-border-60-minutes-transcript/. \6\ Simone McCarthy, `` `Two Sessions': China scraps a decades-long political tradition as Xi tightens control amid economic woes,'' CNN (Mar. 4, 2024), https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/04/china/china-two- sessions-xi-jinping-economic-challenges-intl-hnk/index.html. \7\ Elieen Sullivan, ``Growing Numbers of Chinese Migrants Are Crossing the Southern Border,'' New York Times (Nov. 23, 2023), https:/ /www.nytimes.com/2023/11/24/us/politics/china-migrants-us-border.html. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The trip to the United States via the Southern Border is expensive for Chinese migrants. They must pay for air travel, often routing through countries like Thailand, Turkey, and Ecuador that do not require Chinese nationals to obtain visas prior to arrival.\8\ The trip often also involves paying local cartels or people smugglers known as ``snakeheads'' to arrange for safe passage through the Darien Gap and/ or to an entry point on the Southern U.S. Border.\9\ As a result, many of the migrants apprehended in the last year have come from China's expansive middle class. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \8\ ``Which Countries can Chinese passport holders visit without a Visa?''

There are several reasonable explanations for why the numbers might have increased when they did. The first is the end of the Zero- Covid policy in 2022, which permitted more Chinese nationals to travel abroad than had been able to since the beginning of the pandemic. On- line discussions have referred to ``runxue'' or ``run philosophy'' as a way of talking about emigrating from China after harsh lockdowns in 2022.\10\ The decision to undertake this route is also a product of modern information sharing through social media and on-line platforms. Many migrants who felt an urgency to leave China cited videos on the Chinese version of TikTok called Douyin, or on TikTok itself, as well as other social media outlets, as having provided the information they needed to undertake the journey.\11\ As the number of people who cross successfully into the United States increases and they share their experiences, more individuals looking for a viable path follow in their footsteps. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \10\ Vincent Ni, `` `Run Philosophy': The Chinese Citizens Seeking to Leave Amid Covid Uncertainty,'' The Guardian (Jul. 20, 2022), https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/20/run-philosophy-the- chinese-citizens-seeking-to-leave-amid-covid-uncertainty. \11\ Echo Wang and Mica Rosenberg, ``Migrants Find Tips on Chinese Version of TikTok for long trek to U.S.-Mexico Border,'' Reuters (Apr. 28, 2023), https://www.reuters.com/world/migrants-find-tips-chinese- version-tiktok-long-trek-us-mexico-border-2023-04-28/. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A further motivation comes from the fact that Chinese nationals who enter the United States and apply for asylum have also been more successful than many other nationalities, given the valid concerns they express about political repression or the lack of freedom to practice Christianity in China.\12\ The lack of cooperation between the United States and China on effecting deportations--something that was endemic to the relationship in the 1950's through 1970's and has ebbed and flowed in the years since--has ensured that even those not granted the right to remain in the United States would not be able to be returned to China. That situation is starting to change, and as deportations increase, they might begin to affect the numbers of people arriving.\13\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \12\ Anugrah Kumar, ``China `Escalated persecution' against Christian Churches in 2022, watchdog warns,'' The Christian Post (Feb. 20, 2023), https://www.christianpost.com/news/china-escalated- persecution-against-christian-churches-in-2022.html. \13\ Didi Tang, ``China and U.S. Resume Cooperation on Deportation as Chinese Immigrants Rush in from Southern Border,'' AP News (May 9, 2024), https://apnews.com/article/china-immigration-border-deportation- mayorkas-514f42ee56e80fe7eb7f9fcc71c4d55c. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Recent reports have highlighted the demographics of the Chinese migrants. Most of the unauthorized migrants crossing the Southern Border have been single adults traveling alone, and although public statistics do not account for gender, many who have been interviewed have been men. This is one area in which knowledge of history and culture can provide some reassurance. Before 1965, migration to the United States was dominated by men traveling alone. Very often they have not been single men, but men with families who travel first, undertaking the greater dangers of the trip with the hope of bringing family members to join them once established. This pattern was established in the earliest days of Chinese migration to the United States beginning in the 1850's: ``Chinese American communities were predominately made up of men--more than half of them married--during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . . . Chinese women did immigrate to the United States, but their numbers were small. During the nineteenth century, the traditional Chinese patriarchal family system discouraged and even forbade `decent' women from traveling abroad. The harsh living conditions in California, high levels of anti-Chinese violence, expensive transpacific transportation, and the lack of available jobs for women were also factors that discouraged Chinese women from immigrating.''\14\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \14\ Erika Lee, The Making of Asian America: A History (Simon & Schuster, 2015), 67. Since the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act did away with National Origins quotas and gave preference to family reunification and skill-based visas, legal migration from China has skewed female, with the result of the overall demographics of Chinese immigrants in the United States trending majority female.\15\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \15\ Jan Ryan, ``Chinese Women as Transnational Migrants: Gender and Class in Global Migration Narratives,'' International Migration 40.2 (2002): 1. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- However, just as in the earliest periods of migration, dangerous routes for unauthorized migrants are dominated by men. In the 1990's there were many concerns about unauthorized Chinese migrants arriving in the United States after being smuggled into U.S. ports via shipping containers on cargo ships. In 1993, the cargo ship The Golden Venture ran aground outside the Port of New York, and 286 undocumented migrants from China's Fujian Province who had been aboard were discovered, some swimming for their lives for the U.S. shore. The survivors numbered 262 men and 24 women.\16\ Overwhelmingly, the migrants seeking refuge in the United States after undertaking an arduous voyage to get there were men traveling alone. It would not be surprising that Chinese migrants undergoing the route through the Darien Gap to the United States would be majority male, if in fact they are. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \16\ Golden Venture: A Documentary About the U.S. Immigration Crisis, (2015), https://www.goldenventuremovie.com/facts.htm. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- History also demonstrates that there is precedent to fearing Chinese migrants. The Chinese became the first and only nation to be singled out in U.S. immigration law with the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, which banned the migration of Chinese laborers to the United States. The Exclusion Act was extended several times and made ``permanent'' until its ultimate repeal in 1943 in recognition of Chinese cooperation as an ally in World War Two. The Anti-Chinese Movement that precipitated the act cited Chinese migration as a unique threat to the United States through both the entry of a ``degraded and inferior race'' incompatible and unassimilable with the existing white and Western European population and the ``economic danger'' of migrants who worked hard and fast for lower wages than could sustain a Euro- American man.\17\ These fears led to extreme violence against Chinese immigrants, including mob violence and the burning of Chinatowns before the passage of the first of the acts that collectively became the Chinese Exclusion Acts. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \17\ Lee, 89. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Those acts in turn resulted in rising levels of unauthorized Chinese migration, as migrants sought ways around the discriminatory measures. During the decades of Exclusion, a black market of Chinese- American identities emerged that allowed individuals to circumvent immigration laws. Additionally, Chinese migrants during this period sometimes crossed the southern U.S. border to enter the United States.\18\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \18\ Erika Lee, ``Enforcing the Borders: Chinese Exclusion along the U.S. Borders with Canada and Mexico, 1882-1924,'' Journal of American History 89.1 (June 2002): 54-86. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- After the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, direct migration between the Chinese mainland and the United States was severely curtailed until the reopening of relations in the 1970's. During that period, though, Chinese nationals in the United States faced suspicion and harassment from U.S. authorities concerned about the national security risk they posed. Whereas Eastern European defectors were often assumed to be freedom-seeking, Chinese nationals with families still in China behind the ``bamboo curtain'' came under intense scrutiny. The history of unauthorized migration and forged documentation during the Exclusion Era created the impetus for FBI raids on Chinatown organizations, arrests, and harassment of Chinese migrants who did not support Chiang Kai-shek's Republic of China regime. Sending remittances home to family was criminalized under the Trading with the Enemy Act, and Chinese scholars and scientists in the United States when the Korean War broke out came under suspicion as potential spies.\19\ Most famously, Chinese scientist Qian Xuesen was harassed enough to decide to return to China, despite earlier plans to remain permanently in the United States, and once returned he became an important public figure in support of Chinese leader Mao Zedong and in the development of the Silkworm missile.\20\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \19\ Detailed in my book, The Diplomacy of Migration: Transnational Lives and the Making of U.S.-China Relations in the Cold War (Cornell University Press, 2015). \20\ Kavita Puri, ``Qian Xuesen: The Man the US Deported--Who Then Helped China into Space,'' BBC (Oct. 26, 2020), https://www.bbc.com/ news/stories-54695598. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Even after normalization of relations and the reopening of regular paths of immigration, Chinese migrants have been repeatedly brought under suspicion of threatening national security and economic strength for little reason other than their ethnicity. In 1982, Chinese immigrant Vincent Chin was murdered in Detroit by 2 unemployed auto workers after getting into an altercation at a bar. The men who attacked him were heard to invoke fears of Japanese economic success to the detriment of the American worker.\21\ During the 1990's, Taiwanese American scientist Wen Ho Lee was arrested and held for over a year over espionage charges that never had enough clear evidence to try, much less convict him.\22\ During the Covid Pandemic, there were many documented instances of suspicion, harassment, and violence against Chinese Americans, as their race and ethnicity became associated with the source of the pandemic that caused such significant economic and personal harm.\23\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \21\ Harmeet Kaur, ``Vincent China was beaten to death 40 years ago.

Thank you, Dr. Oyen. I will now recognize Mr. Bensman for 5 minutes for his opening statement. STATEMENT OF TODD BENSMAN, NATIONAL SECURITY FELLOW, CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES Mr. Bensman. Hi. Thank you for the privilege of having me here today. As I speak with you at this minute, Chinese nationals are illegally crossing our Southwest Border in historic numbers and preparing for their second crime, asylum fraud. They disfigure and toss their passports like this one because the stamps inside prove their holders passed through safe countries that would have granted protection. That would disqualify them for U.S. asylum. Likewise, they discard Mexican residency cards like these all over the U.S. side and the Mexican side which the Mexicans require for them to move north because they show that Mexico already granted them protection, which is another disqualifier for asylum. A record-smashing 50,000 Chinese nationals have crossed the Southern Border since Biden entered office and stood up policies that mainline them into interior America within 48 hours. The Chinese people responded predictably to this unprecedented invitation. At current escalating rates, their numbers should hit 100,000 by 2024's end. All of China knows they will be freed on personal recognizance for years and likely remain permanently. This administration tolerates mass illegal entry and asylum fraud, but we are here today because the administration seems equally accommodating to a direct national security threat this human flow poses. That would be China's relentless economic and political espionage campaigns, thievery of cutting-edge defense technologies, and dissident suppression operations against our citizens and legal residents. To be sure, most of those 50,000 Chinese nationals are merely coming to work and enjoy America's famed lifestyle, but there can be little doubt that Beijing's spy masters also noticed right away when a welcome wagon greeted the first of its 50,000 citizens that America's new President had just opened a new superhighway over the U.S. Southwest Border, tailor-built to carry intelligence operatives. U.S. counterintelligence agencies must assume Beijing is already injecting agents into this flow. Recent spy prosecutions in the U.S. and public intelligence community assessments tell us this threat is not speculative. The prosecutions revealed young 20-something agents got in by exploiting U.S. student and cultural exchange visas. They heisted our secrets from inside and elite U.S. universities, research institutes, and corporations. It follows that the prosecutions put heat on legal visa abuses and drove up the risk of detection to China. Just when an alternative way to get its operatives in, the Biden government handed China the golden ticket, warm greetings at the border and rapid releases with almost no questions asked. The U.S. intelligence community's own assessments tell us what is in store. China will remain the most aggressive espionage actor on U.S. soil and has big plans. Biden's own 2024 DHS threat assessment predicts much more than rapacious economic espionage. It says the CCP operatives will hunt down dissidents in America and will use ``physical assault, threats, harassment, defamation, and kidnapping out of country,'' read rendition, to ``suppress oppositional voices.'' Almost unbelievably, Beijing already has established inside the United States what the DHS assessment called police stations from which CCP operatives surveil and harass dissidents. About those 50,000 nonspy, economic migrants can they all be regarded as entirely benevolent, asylum fraud aside? They are fodder for coerced recruitment by China. Office of Director of National Intelligence assessments 2023 and 2024 say China is going to ``pressure families back home to recruit Chinese abroad as informants and operatives.'' As if quick releases after border crossings were not golden ticket enough, the Biden administration gifted the Chinese intelligence an especially sparkling new policy. Washington ordered Border Patrol to reduce the number of interview questions for incoming Chinese nationals from 40 to just 5, the Daily Caller has reported. Why? To move them into the country even faster, including those who tossed their identity documents and might as well have given their names as Mickey Mouse. Reporting indicates they have all learned to easily defeat the 5 questions and be shown the entrance door to America, which makes them all strangers, just the way Beijing's spy masters wanted. Thank you.   Chairman Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Bensman. I thank the witnesses for your valuable testimony, and let's see, where is my place? We have got--oh, I am sorry. We are here. Members will be recognized by order of seniority for their 5 minutes of questioning. An additional round of questioning may be called after all Members have been recognized. I now recognize myself for 5 minutes of questioning. Professor Oyen, I think I will start with you. You talked about risk. In fact, Mr. Ivey opened his comments with commentary about risks of Asians being discriminated against or Chinese being discriminated against. Of course, we know that there is some very difficult history in the United States of that sort. So what of that? I mean, what are you saying there? What have you got? Let me just tick off some of the risks that have been specifically identified in other witnesses' testimony. I have always understood and lots of evidence before this Congress indicates that China is engaged in very intensive economic espionage against the United States. We have heard testimony. I recited in my opening statement about the aggressive Chinese money-laundering operations in the United States. Mr. Bensman just made reference to in news reports it has been wide-spread, including one in North Carolina I heard about, about Chinese ``police stations,'' which are bent on intimidating, harassing, and in some cases--well, many awful things against folks of Chinese heritage in the United States. We have heard about cultural exchange programs and college campuses being used as Trojan horses for a Chinese intelligence infiltration. Then you have got a rapidly-increasing population of Chinese migrants coming in irregularly. So what about all that? Should that be just ignored or is it a good thing, perhaps? Ms. Oyen. I would say neither. I mean, I am suggesting that in the grand scheme of history you can see that this kind of migration and these kinds of concerns have existed before, that the concerns about security risks from irregular migration are not new. That there are plenty of valid concerns about the relationship with China and the kinds of Chinese espionage that might be happening. I am saying, though, that I do not have any--I have not seen anything that suggests that this particular population is part of this espionage network. There is no definitive evidence one way or the other. Chairman Bishop. So do you think there needs to be definitive evidence in the case of every---- Ms. Oyen. I think there needs to be. Well, I mean this is not up to me to say. This is I am a historian, right? I am not a policy maker. But because there is no definitive evidence either way I would caution against this broad-scale assumption that people who are seeking asylum in the United States are, in fact, spies coming to undermine it when there are, in fact, very good other explanations and there are also lots of historical precedents for that kind of rhetoric having very negative effects on the existing Chinese-American community. So I think that the history leads us to have some caution in how we speak about this population coming in. Chairman Bishop. So is it a question of how we speak about it or what we are doing to vet them? Do you think they should be vetted intensively? Ms. Oyen. I think every immigrant who comes into the United States should be vetted, but that is part of the---- Chairman Bishop. I certainly agree with that. They are not being, so let's let that and set that aside. Would you say that there are additional risks with China as a global adversary of the United States that would warrant additional intensive vetting for Chinese migrants who are entering without legal authorization? Ms. Oyen. I think that historically we have seen that it is at periods of high tension between the United States and China we have engaged in greater vetting, but we have also seen historically that the patterns of the people who are engaged with espionage have not been economic migrants---- Chairman Bishop. Yes. Ms. Oyen . Who are. In fact, the 1950's era or even the 1900's era people and the 1990's era migrants who came in by irregular means were not coming in that way. Chairman Bishop. OK. Ms. Oyen. I think that knowing that history is important. Chairman Bishop. I got you. I don't want to cut you off but let me get to Mr. Bensman before we get done. So how about that, Mr. Bensman? If I am hearing from the Ranking Member and Professor Oyen's ideas, we really shouldn't say anything about this because it is going to be discriminatory. What about that? Why isn't that true? Or if it is true, what do you say about it? Mr. Bensman. Well, the U.S.--excuse me--the U.S. Homeland Security enterprise, especially in dealing with the border, has for decades isolated particular nationalities based on our relations with their governments, for example, Iran. When we have immigrants from Iran hit the border we will set them aside and bring in the FBI and CIA and others to interview them to try to figure out, you know, what they are about. Are they good? Are they are they fleeing the regime or are they part of the regime? Are they a terrorist actor? North Koreans that hit the border, I mean, everybody can understand why a North Korean would want to leave North Korea, but we also know North Korea is a source of mischief all over the world and they are sending their representatives. So we do separate certain nationalities as a matter of routine---- Chairman Bishop. Yes. Mr. Bensman . From all of the Middle Eastern countries and it just depends on. But China most certainly we did all the way up until about last year. Chairman Bishop. Perhaps we will have another round. I am conscious of having overstayed my time. So the Ranking Member, I will--no, no. Mr. Ivey. You have one more question? Chairman Bishop. Well, I think I will. I will do---- Mr. Ivey. We are not beating---- Chairman Bishop. I appreciate that, Mr. Ranking Member. Mr. Ivey . The bushes for---- Chairman Bishop. Right, and I appreciate it. Oh, I appreciate it and thank you for that indulgence. Yes, let me follow it up in this way. I do think it is correct to say there is a nationality concern here that is predicated on a hostile relationship of governments that counsels additional concern but let me just file this last question for maybe Mr. Bensman. I always hear from the Secretary of Homeland Security we have a global, you know, eruption of migration that accounts for all of this. Other than the possibility that--and maybe Mr. Hankinson led with this assorted--and I will probably--maybe I will direct the question Mr. Hankinson. I am not aware of any major change in China that would account for this sudden explosion of Chinese illegal migrants. There is a lot of government totalitarian control in that country and even in terms of people leaving the country. So is there something I am missing? Is there some, you know, chaos that has erupted in China that would account for this sudden change, a large change? Mr. Bensman. Well, I spend a lot of time with the immigrants. I have interviewed thousands of them. I have met Chinese. I can never get the Chinese to talk to me. I have an interpretation app which is difficult anyway, but I don't think that they would want to talk to me. But what I gather from my interviews with many thousands of immigrants on their way here is that they are coming now because all their friends got in. All their relatives just got in. The border is open. We are going for it. Well, like, what if the Americans changed their minds all of a sudden, and so there is this big rush on? I have to say that the Chinese are probably no different. They are going to be looking for lifestyle upgrades. A lot of the Chinese that I meet on the trail seem very well-resourced, very well put together. They don't seem like they are starving peasants. They often spend tens of thousands of dollars to make the journey. It is an opportunity for them. Now, the economy in China is not, you know, as robust as it has been but they can get in now. Chairman Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Bensman. Again, I think the Ranking Member for his indulgence and I will exercise similar indulgence. I yield to--or I recognize Mr. Ivey for 5 minutes of questioning and whatever else, too. Mr. Ivey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that. I want to separate the apples and oranges out here because we have got sort-of two conversations about migration. One is the Southwestern Border, people crossing like a lot of the other people coming from countries, Central America and the like. The other is the economic espionage crowd which, as I understand it, is not crossing at the border. These are people who are coming over on visas and the like. The main difference I am told, I was just in a conference on AI where we were talking a lot about the competition between the United States and China and the concern that China is catching us and has passed us potentially on some of these areas with respect to AI and tech. Some of it is based on economic espionage. Some of it is also based on the fact that I think they have 5 times more engineers and computer scientists than the United States has, which is why we bring so many of them over. But one of the points that was made was that 38 percent of the tech scientists in the United States are from China. Those are not people who came here, you know, that came across the border with no documents or falsified documents. They were people who were brought here by their companies. In fact, if you talk to some of these companies they will tell you they are having trouble bringing people over. They need them because of the engineering and scientific expertise. They have trouble bringing them over because of the visa process here in the United States. In some instances they said, I talked to one VC leader who said that he was trying to bring somebody over from India. It took so long that what he did instead was he just set up a satellite company in Canada and started bringing him over there. So in some respects, it is not of, you know, people coming over here too fast for these types of jobs here in the United States. They are not coming fast enough for these tech leaders who want to have them here. So I did want to make sure, and I don't know if I am disputing what you said, Mr. Bensman, or not, but I think it is pretty clear cut that the people coming across the border who don't have--even if they have a technical background if they don't have the documents Microsoft is not going to hire them. Google is not going to hire them. You know, they are not going to get those kinds of jobs. They are not going to be professors at Stanford or Harvard or wherever. You can't just come over here and show up one day and get a job. So the economic, yes, and that is where the economic espionage is happening. It is happening at that level. It is not happening at the level where people are crossing the border, as I am told by people who, (A), work at the border but also, more importantly, own and run those companies where they are complaining most loudly about the economic espionage. So the focus they want us to make is in part focused on the Chinese government, which sponsors a lot of that activity and also where there are technology responses aimed at protecting the information and better ways and vetting internally to make sure the right people have the access to that information. Mr. Singleton, I think you mentioned something about tools for espionage as well with respect to, I guess, crossing at the Southwest Border. I would raise the same kind of questions that I did just a moment ago. But you also said something about things that Congress can do to address these problems, and I think it is I am going to set aside the economic espionage piece for the reasons I just stated. I think you mentioned something about improving infrastructure for vetting and the like at the border? I wanted to give you a chance to elaborate on that. Mr. Singleton. Thank you very much. I would agree with you that the vast majority of Chinese nationals who live and study in the United States stay and contribute to our communities. We also have to recognize, however, that there are large numbers, thousands of Chinese nationals who are coming here to from China to study at our universities at the behest, direction, and with the sponsorship under the Chinese Communist Party in support of military civil fusion and its broader strategy. So enhancing those established, legal mechanisms to both vet at U.S. embassies and consulates to allow them in, but also recognizing the threat that exists in that legal immigration space is critical. I think many of the---- Mr. Ivey. Well, let me ask you on how to bulk that up. How would you address that? Mr. Singleton. Having also been a former consular officer I can acknowledge the amount of time that you have to adjudicate a visa for a particular entrant is minuscule, sometimes 30 seconds or less to make a decision about a particular student. One of the things that needs to be done is a much broader understanding of the Chinese universities that are involved in military civil fusion and adding additional scrutiny for those students. To give great examples, my alma mater, Texas A&M, used to maintain research partnerships with China's Ocean University which is responsible for constructing Chinese military submarines. Other Chinese universities like Sichuan University develop China's nuclear weapons, and yet we allow high-level STEM-related research partnerships between those two schools that are wholly unregulated. As a consular officer, I am wholly unequipped to make a decision about whether that individual represents a threat. So it really does require us to recognize how China has tapped into its civilian university structure to in effect weaponize it. Mr. Ivey. On that point, and I appreciate you for letting me run over, Mr. Chairman, with respect to tech companies so you mentioned sort-of the academic community. Are there similar sorts of issues with respect to the high-tech community as well? Mr. Singleton. There have been a number of documented instances in which that has occurred, but again, I do---- Mr. Ivey. Give me an example. Mr. Singleton. Sure. I mean, I think that there have been several serious FBI indictments in the last 4 years that talk about the placement of Chinese nationals in high-tech companies, particularly in Silicon Valley, and then that those individuals are sending back research, not public information, back to Chinese individuals and universities. There is also occurring---- Mr. Ivey. Well, let me stop you there. Did they not go through a vetting process or---- Mr. Singleton. I think it shows that our vetting process is currently inadequate and that when those nationals do gain entrance and employment there is no follow-on screening. For example, if a Chinese national from a Chinese military civil fusion university were to matriculate at a U.S. school with their political science and then the next day change it to nuclear physics, there is no one monitoring that change in process. So it is both pre- and post-facto screening that is-- -- Mr. Ivey. Let me stick with the companies here for a second. So with respect to, I don't know, Microsoft, since they will be here next week apparently or in the next few weeks, they hire somebody and they are not monitoring them or they don't have internal controls with respect to protecting their confidential information? I mean---- Mr. Singleton. It is that we are talking about a completely haphazard process. Nothing is required in statute or required and even today Microsoft announced that it was moving thousands of its AI engineers outside of China, relocating them because of concerns about Chinese military civil fusion and the potential risks to losing critical cutting-edge technology because of Chinese espionage. Mr. Ivey. OK. All right. Mr. Chairman, thank you. I appreciate you for letting me run on. Chairman Bishop. I thank the Ranking Member and I have, well, one nit to pick and I will give you an opportunity to respond if I can before we go on. There was a comment in your opening statement staff handed to me that one of the sector chiefs gave that testimony that, ``We treat everybody the same. It doesn't matter where you come from. It doesn't matter what your nationality is or what your religious beliefs are. We are going to treat everybody exactly the same.'' But then immediately below that a question was asked, ``Do you know if any additional investigation or interviews are conducted on Chinese nationals in U.S. sector?'' ``Yes.'' ``And that they are?'' ``Yes, that they are. Why?'' Then I am skipping a little bit here but he says, ``I have sector intelligence unit agents that are assigned to the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force team and so FBI has expressed an interest in doing additional screening and interviews for Chinese nationals.'' I yield back, yield to the Ranking Member. Mr. Ivey. Well, just an observation, I appreciate that clarification for me and correction, but I thought our panel was just testifying a few minutes ago that you only get 5 questions---- Chairman Bishop. Yes. Mr. Ivey . When they are coming in. So I am not sure which it is. Chairman Bishop. I am not sure where it comes out either. Mr. Ivey. Yes. Chairman Bishop. I think, but maybe we are in somewhat agreement. Maybe we are in agreement. I am not sure about if there is a need for more intensive vetting of Chinese nationals. Whether it is happening or not I am not totally clear. So I thank the Ranking Member again for the spirit of collegiality in which we do our subcommittee hearings and may it extend to the rest of Congress. But with that, I will recognize the gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Ezell for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Over the past year this committee has shown the failure of the Biden administration's open border policies. Under the President's watch there been over 8 million illegal aliens released into this country. But what is not clearly revealed in the group of 8 million illegals as an alarming statistics. The fastest-growing group crossing the border illegally is not from Mexico or South America. They are from China. Since President Biden has taken office, CBP encounters with Chinese nationals has risen over 4,200 percent. The CCP has targeted businesses, universities, and lawmakers and its efforts to undermine America. The thought that CCP would not use an open borders to their advantage is nonsense. Last year President Biden's DHS released guidance that significantly reduced the vetting process of these Chinese nationals. The number of questions, what we talked about earlier, has gone from 40 to just 5. Mr. Hankinson, do you believe the Biden administration is making it any easier for the Chinese nationals to enter this country illegally? Mr. Hankinson. I do. Excuse me. Yes, I do. I think the charts and the graphs and the statistics are pretty clear that when people understand that they will be released once they arrive in the United States as long as they express a credible fear and intent to launch an asylum claim, and we do know that 85 percent, 90 percent of those claims are fraudulent, meaning that they are based on facts that just don't generate a claim for asylum that will be approved, then they come. With social media that has sort-of greatly magnified exponentially the information that is getting back to countries all around the world. I think we are up to, like, 180 countries now that have been caught entering illegally at the border in the last few years. So when you say that you are not going to detain people, when you are releasing them on their own recognizance, when you are paroling them in, and when they know that the system will not be able to process them for years, then you send a clear signal and people understand it. Mr. Ezell. Thank you. Do you know what 5 questions the Chinese nationals in the interview? Do you know what the 5 questions are? Mr. Hankinson. Well, I have a completely unconfirmed snapshot of what they are, and they are just basic questions about where you come from? Do you have any affiliation with the Chinese government? Did you pay for your trip to the United States? Did you pay a smuggler? Have you got any prior arrests? A shortened version of the form that visa applicants have to answer what you are supposed to say. I don't have a criminal record. I am not a member of the Nazi Party or the Communist Party and so on. Mr. Ezell. Yes. So they just check it off so there is no real verification whether they are telling the truth or not? Mr. Hankinson. There is absolutely no way to verify. If someone at the border says I don't have a criminal record, we don't have the criminal records of China easily accessible. If we ask the Chinese for them they wouldn't give them to us I am pretty sure unless it was someone that they wanted back, for example a dissident. Mr. Ezell. Yes. When we do obtain any information and run it throughout the internal databases do you know if China is providing any information on the aliens? Do you know if they are doing any of that? Mr. Hankinson. You are asking if the Chinese share their-- as far as I know, no. We have countries in the Visa Waiver Program that do share criminal records with us that that can be done automatically, but as far as I am aware there is no automatic data sharing with China of either fact data or bio data. Mr. Ezell. Do you have any opinion about President Biden and his policies? Is this putting America at a greater risk? Mr. Hankinson. I think statistically it is undeniable. If you have 50,000 additional people and you have no confirmation of their background, their criminal records, their past affiliation or present affiliation with the government or any of its entities, I think it is almost certain that a proportion, probably very small, but a proportion of them are coming here with the intent to at some point do some harm. Mr. Ezell. Do you have any examples of any of these bad actors that have entered the country illegally? Mr. Hankinson. Well, one recent example that struck me was in March of this year in 29 Palms in California. There was a Chinese man who, I think, had crossed the border illegally and been released who attempted to get on to the military base. At the time the local headlines, the local press said he was confused and he said he was lost and he didn't know where he was going. I wrote at the time in an op-ed that, geez, if you were going to try to scope out a base and try to get some basic intel and figure out what the security procedures were at U.S. military bases, what better way than to send some, excuse me, but a doofus. But then I later found out that there have been over 100 of these incidents by Chinese nationals in the past few years according to a source quoted by the Wall Street Journal. So one time maybe, but 100 times starts to seem a little bit more like a pattern. Mr. Ezell. Pretty obvious. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Chairman Bishop. I thank the gentleman for yielding back. I now represent--recognize the gentlelady, Mrs. Ramirez, for 5 minutes of questioning. Mrs. Ramirez. Thank you, Chairman and Ranking Member. I want to start by expressing my disappointment that this committee still allows special witnesses from an organization that has been designated as a hate group for publishing the works of white nationalists. Mr. Bensman, yes or no, have you ever used or invoked invasion rhetoric or language when referencing migrants? Mr. Bensman. No, I have not. Mrs. Ramirez. OK. Well, let me ask you a follow-up. Is your Twitter handle @bensmantodd, correct? Mr. Bensman. Yes. Mrs. Ramirez. OK. So I want to show you here something. As you can see, I have a number of your Twitter posts here and it is not hard to find examples of you or someone who is doing a good job pretending to be you uplifting the same invasion rhetoric central to the white nationalist and anti-Semitic great replacement conspiracy theory. Let me read just one of them. ``Border invasion series,'' oh, let me read one more, one more, ``Biden administration rechanneled migrant waves to hide invasion at Southern Border.'' Folks, no one from a hate group should ever be invited to provide testimony before this committee. It hurts our integrity as a committee and it is why as I am sitting here I am going to direct my questions to an actual expert. The Department of State's 2023 human rights documents that significant human rights issues in China include credible reports of unlawful killings, forced disappearances, torture, and arbitrary detention by the Chinese government, forced labor, and genocide against ethnic minorities. So my question is to Dr. Oyen. It seems Chinese nationals seeking humanitarian relief have plenty to fear. Can you briefly speak to the human rights conditions and risks in China? Let me specifically ask you how has the Chinese government increased repression of its citizenry under President Xi? Ms. Oyen. There has been a tightening of controls since 2012 when President Xi first took power and in the recent years since he has become a essentially permanent leader that has increased as well. We have we have seen this. There is the long-standing, the longer history of the persecution of the Uyghur people, but there has also been very specific examples of Chinese and Muslim adherents to their faith not being permitted to worship in the ways that they choose. There has also been persecution of people who were part of something that is called the Chinese Democratic Party. There was a period of open flourishing of ideas where people created ideas when talking about future plans for China and ways in which the Chinese government might serve people. And that the people who were part of that party and who were engaged in that have been largely subject to a crackdown where they have been arrested and harassed for their beliefs. In some cases have successfully sought asylum. So there is also just built into this last decade, 12 years of Xi Jinping's rules, there has been a tightening of laws and control over the extent to which people can talk freely about the government, the ways that they criticize the government. There has been tightening of internet controls that already existed, right, but there is continuing cracking down on internet controls. So certainly there are examples of the government being authoritarian and being hard on civilians such as that they might decide that they can't live their lives or they can't live their lives free of repression. Mrs. Ramirez. Thank you, Dr. Oyen. It seems to me, I mean, based on your testimony and even seeing what you submitted that we have to take seriously that there are Chinese nationals that are fleeing oppressive regimes. They are seeking refuge and humanitarian relief and that those who flee authoritarian China are no different than all of those who flee oppressive regimes. Some of those asylum seekers were the ancestors of the people that are in this room right now, and it is unacceptable that in the middle of celebrating the contributions of our Asian American and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities here we are with rhetoric about Chinese immigrant invasion. I am not surprised, however, because a century ago the United States enacted the Immigration Act of 1924, a law that heavily influenced by racist beliefs that close the door on immigration from Asia, building on the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and here we are in this committee now. So with that on record, Chairman, I yield back. Chairman Bishop. The gentlewoman yields back. I now recognize the gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Strong, for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Strong. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to talk more about the points Mr. Ezell mentioned. Mr. Bensman, most of the Chinese migrants that illegally entered the United States at the Southwest Border are first- timers and therefore they do not have any flags in the U.S. criminal database. The CCP does not share criminal information with U.S. law enforcement. I will emphasize that unless our intelligence agencies have a reason to flag a migrant all CBP can do is rely on a migrant's story. Most Chinese migrants state that they are here to claim asylum or for economic reasons. From a national security perspective, is relying only on a migrant's word enough to determine whether the migrant came to the United States with nefarious intent? What types of risk does this blind reliance pose? Mr. Bensman. Thank you. First of all, I would like to recommend a book to Mrs. Ramirez, ``Making Hate Pay,'' by Tyler O'Neil, ``The corruption of the Southern Poverty Law Center.'' I also want to tell you, Ms. Ramirez, that as far as I don't know what you have on your board, I would like to study it, there is no hateful anti-Semitic speech in my Twitter feed. I am Jewish, and we don't really get with white nationalists. That is not our thing so get your facts straight. As far as your---- Mrs. Ramirez. Mr. Chairman, he is referring to me so I just wondered---- Chairman Bishop. It is the gentleman's time from Alabama. Mr. Strong. Thank you, sir. Let's go back to that question. What type of risk does the blind reliance pose? Mr. Bensman. What type of risk does---- Mr. Strong. What type of risk does this blind reliance related to national security, just what--if they tell us they are great people, that is what we are doing at our border right now. Oh, I want to come to America. What does this pose whenever they say come on in? Mr. Bensman. Well, it is the ultimate stranger danger at the border. That is our problem with having mass migration at these historic levels. We can't know who anyone is. We can't really go to the Chinese, as I think my colleague said, for an intel share. We can't go to really very many countries at all for an intel share. Mr. Strong. Thank you. What ways can CBP potentially reduce that risk? Mr. Bensman. Well, there is not a whole lot they can do. They will run text database checks. They will maybe run some criminal history checks and then they will let them in. But if they haven't been in the United States to commit crimes in the past there is not going to be--they are going to come up with a negative, right? It will be a big blank. So you just have to, kind-of, take their word for it. A lot of them, like I said, dump their ID documents, their passports, and say my name is Mickey Mouse. Mr. Strong. OK. I know that Russia invaded Ukraine and the Ukrainians defended itself. Hamas invaded Israel and Israel defended itself. The United States is being invaded, and I think that is the right word, by 160 different countries, and this administration has done nothing. Ten million illegal aliens coming across the border. I will say this again. This fentanyl is going to kill a generation of Americans. It is not a Republican issue. It is not a Democratic issue. It is an American issue. I will also bring up what is happening right now at the border. Border security for every drone they are flying the Mexican cartel is flying 17. They are coming into U.S. air space bringing fentanyl, 60 pounds, 80 pounds, 100 pounds at a time, and we are doing nothing. Killing a generation of Americans. You have mentioned some of the questions that are asked. You know, it is almost comical the questions. You know, why don't they ask them what kind of chewing gum do they like or their favorite city in America or their favorite color because they are getting the intelligence of the questions they are asking is about as important as that. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman Bishop. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize the gentlelady from New York, I believe, right, Ms. Clarke. Ms. Clarke. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I thank our Ranking Member. I want to yield some time to my colleague, Mrs. Ramirez of Illinois. Mrs. Ramirez. Thank you, Congresswoman Clarke. Just to follow up from the remarks that the witness just made, so I said the organization and then I said your Tweets, and we will be happy to give you a printout. There are so many of them so you will have an opportunity to read them closely after committee. But I want to make sure that--Mr. Chairman, I want to enter this into the record which is a article from the Southern Poverty Law Center that ranks immigrant studies as one of the white nationalist organizations. Mr. Strong. I object. Mrs. Ramirez. OK. Well, then let me see if I can enter this court record here that where the Center for Immigration Studies filed a case against the Southern Poverty Law Center, but the courts actually found this to--they dismissed the motion because there was not enough information to be able to determine that they had a case against them. Mr. Ivey. Mr. Chairman, I would move to include in the record both of the documents that the gentlelady from Illinois has offered. Chairman Bishop. I had been so moved. Is there a motion at the table? Mr. Strong. Motion. Chairman Bishop. A motion before--there is no debate on that motion? All in favor of the motion on the table, say aye. All opposed, say no. I hear the motion to have been approved and the---- Mr. Strong. I would ask for a recorded vote, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Bishop. It is a recorded vote. All in favor, let's see, we have to--the Clerk will call the roll. Ms. Clarke. Mr. Chairman, I did yield my time to Mrs. Ramirez. Since we are going through this process, I hope that my time will be restored. Mr. Ivey. I would ask the Chair to pause the clock at where was stopped. Chairman Bishop. It appears to me the clerk pause the clock at 3:15, which I assume is pursuant to the rule. Ms. Clarke. Well, it was actually about 4 minutes---- Chairman Bishop. Well---- Mr. Ivey. When the objection came. Chairman Bishop. I am going to--if they are able to establish what the time was I have no problem with putting it back as it was, but the request was not made until now. Mr. Ivey. Well, let's do the vote, but I would suggest to the Chair that we have been fairly flexible on time going both ways today. Chairman Bishop. I concur about that. Mr. Ivey. All right, thank you. Chairman Bishop. The clerk will call the roll. The Clerk. Ms. Greene of Georgia. Sorry. Ms. Greene of Georgia.  The Clerk. Mr. Ezell.  The Clerk. Mr. Strong. Mr. Strong. Mr. Strong. Aye. The Clerk. Mr. Strong votes aye. Mr. Crane.  The Clerk. Mr. Ivey. Mr. Ivey. No. The Clerk. Mr. Ivey votes no. Mr. Thanadar.  The Clerk. Mrs. Ramirez. Mrs. Ramirez. No. The Clerk. Mrs. Ramirez votes no. Ms. Clarke. Ms. Clarke. No. The Clerk. Ms. Clarke votes no. Chairman Bishop. The Chairman votes no. The Clerk. Mr. Bishop---- Chairman Bishop. Excuse me, the Chairman votes aye. The Clerk. Mr. Bishop votes aye. Mr. Ivey. I liked it better the first time. Chairman Bishop. The clerk will report. The Clerk. On that vote, Mr. Chairman, there were 2 ayes and 3 noes. Chairman Bishop. The motion on the table fails. The motion before the committee is the motion--or the motion of the gentleman, the Ranking Member, to admit the item into the record. All in favor will say aye. All opposed, no. The noes have it. Mr. Ivey. I ask for a recorded vote. Chairman Bishop. A recorded vote is ordered. The clerk will call the roll. The Clerk. Ms. Greene.  The Clerk. Mr. Ezell.  The Clerk. Mr. Strong. Mr. Strong. No. The Clerk. Mr. Strong votes no. Mr. Crane.  The Clerk. Mr. Ivey. Mr. Ivey. Aye. The Clerk. Mr. Ivey votes aye. Mr. Thanadar.  The Clerk. Mrs. Ramirez. Mrs. Ramirez. Aye. The Clerk. Mrs. Ramirez votes aye. Ms. Clarke. Ms. Clarke. Aye. The Clerk. Ms. Clarke votes aye. Chairman Bishop. The Chairman votes no. The Clerk. Chairman Bishop votes no. Chairman Bishop. The clerk will report. The Clerk. On that vote, Mr. Chairman, there were 3 ayes and 2 noes. Chairman Bishop. The motion is adopted and the item will be received into the record.   ------ Chairman Bishop. The time is with the gentlelady of New York. Ms. Clarke. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. We are here today because Republicans are demagoguing and exploiting the xenophobic and white supremacist ideologies that are fueling the immigration debate in this Nation. For those who are showing up at our border I am concerned about how we as a Nation are going to address what is basically a broken immigration system. People don't choose to leave their families and communities, their culture, their language on a whim. Most often people leave because their very lives are at stake. Just 700 miles from our border, the Nation of Haiti is facing an unprecedented crisis. Gangs control their capital city, Port-au-Prince, and every-day citizens are being terrorized by brutal murderers and kidnappings. Millions of Haitians face food insecurity and given the choice between starvation and violence and illicit migration, it is little wonder that people arrive at our borders. Though conditions in China are very different it is never easy for an individual to choose to migrate, and I believe that we as a Nation, particularly a Nation of immigrants, have an obligation to bring our immigration system into the 21st Century so that we can live up to the creed of our Nation. Dr. Oyen, what can you tell us about the demographics of the Chinese border-crossers and why they are leaving China and how they integrate into communities in the United States once they arrive? Ms. Oyen. Based on what has been reported so far, a lot of the reporting seems to be that they are from China's expansive middle class. You will see that there are people who have spent a couple thousand equivalents of U.S. dollars to make the trip, and they have a harrowing journey through Ecuador and through the Darien Gap and up. There are people who spent tens of thousands of dollars which usually allowed them to fly the entire way to Tijuana and then cross the border. The reason why that, sort-of, expansive middle class seems to be the population that is moving, it is people who have something to sell, to have the money to do that, but it is also people who have been particularly severely hit by the zero- COVID policies and the economic fallout from the pandemic. So there is a lot of small business owners who have lost their businesses or have lost jobs or don't see the kinds of jobs that they are looking for or don't see opportunities available to them and so that becomes an argument for economic migration in this way. So the demographics do appear to be predominantly people traveling alone and predominantly male, based on the numbers who are coming into Ecuador which has visa-free entry from China. So it does appear to be that is the population that is most likely out of work, that very often can't find and is not happy in China. In some cases there is, you know, demographic changes in China that make more men than women so and then, of course, there is historical reasons why Chinese men have usually undertaken risky immigration journeys. Ms. Clarke. Very well. Well, Mr. Chairman, I really think that as part of a Committee on Homeland Security we have an obligation to really bring our immigration laws into the 21st Century and do it in a bipartisan manner. I hope that you will be a proponent for that going forward and in the future. Having said that, I thank you for the opportunity and I yield back the balance of my time. Chairman Bishop. The gentlewoman yields back. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Higgins for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Higgins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My colleagues across the aisle, I am just visiting this subcommittee today and I appreciate being here. I know I don't have the right to vote because I am not on this subcommittee. I sit on another one, but I would have voted in support of my Republican colleagues today. Let the historical record reflect that fact. Let me also state that my Democrat colleagues across the aisle appear to be saying to Americans across the country that have endured border policies enacted on the day that President Biden was inaugurated and began his actions, Executive Actions to change the policy of this country to open our border. It wasn't the cartels that changed on January 20, 2021. It was the President of the United States. It wasn't the 1,954 miles of our border that changed in January 2021. It was a President of the United States changed our policies and the world was listening, was it not, Mr. Bensman, as you pointed out. So Americans that have endured 15 million illegals crossing into our country in 4 years, crime waves rolling across America from sea to shining sea, fentanyl poisoning killing 100,000 Americans per year, Americans across the country that have an objection to that, and we have got a problem with that. Apparently Democrats are saying we are all bunch of Nazis, white supremacists, antisemitic. This is disconnected from reality, man. America is suffering generational trauma because of the Biden administration policies that have blown our border wide open. Now immigrants of means, Chinese healthy and well-funded coming into our country being granted what? Asylum. Is a healthy, well-funded, warrior age, young men coming into our country, nobody over there has a problem with that? Mr. Bensman, you mentioned interviewing thousands you said. That is quite a lot. I would say that places you in the expert category, sir. How can we confirm who these Chinese nationals rolling across our Southern Border, thousands at a time now, how can we confirm? How do we know who they are? They tell us. They give us a name. They give us some documentation, but they are healthy. They are well-funded. They could buy documentation anywhere, quality documentation. How do we know who they are? Are we taking any biometric data from them? Are we getting any documentation, DNA, fingerprints, retinal scans, photographs, et cetera? Mr. Bensman. We should be. There should be biometrics collected at different points along the trail in Panama, for example, Costa Rica, if they go through those. Mr. Higgins. At a processing center? Mr. Bensman. Yes, through the---- Mr. Higgins. You are talking about at a DHS-run processing center in another country. But does the United States, the DHS, have possession, from your experience of interviewing these thousands of illegal immigrants, does the United States have files on these people, who they are--fingerprints, retinal scans, et cetera? Mr. Bensman. I would say in general they do not. They will have, and especially they will have maybe a first fingerprint from somewhere along the trail. They may take them at the border once they get here, but they don't really have anything to bounce them off against. Mr. Higgins. OK. So these---- Mr. Bensman. The real---- Mr. Higgins. These Chinese nationals coming into our country from Europe experience or then maybe anyone can answer this, are they are being reviewed for gang affiliations and gang tattoos, triad tattoos, et cetera? Mr. Bensman. No. Mr. Higgins. I see a no. Mr. Singleton. Currently, no. Mr. Singleton. Dr. Oyen, do you know if these Chinese nationals are at least, you know, being looked at for tattoos coming into our country? Ms. Oyen. I would not know that, no. Mr. Higgins. You don't know. Mr. Hankinson, are they being checked? Mr. Hankinson. I wouldn't think they have the time to do a whole lot of checking given how quickly they are being released. Mr. Higgins. Take your shirt off, 10 seconds, tattoos, yes or no? We do it in jails across the country every day at the local, State, and Federal level. We look for tattoos, gang tattoos. We could do it at the border if we wanted to without hiring one more agent or spending one more penny. Take your shirt of. Do you have tattoos, yes or no? It is simple. We do it at jails across the country. Are we are doing that, Mr. Bensman? Mr. Bensman. I would say not. Mr. Higgins. That answer is no. The answer is no. Well, my goodness, I have expired my time, Mr. Chairman, but I have not expired my passion. Thank you, I yield. Chairman Bishop. The gentleman yields back. I had some indication, an inkling that we might proceed to a second round of the questioning, but I don't believe in the light of the turn of the hearing that we will do that. I had started off with great optimism about the nature of the hearing, but it is unfortunate. I will say it is amazing that the person injecting the acrimony is 1 of the 9 Democrats to vote against a resolution condemning the October 7 attack, also voted present on a resolution to bar Hamas members and those who participated in October 7 attack from entering our country. Astonishing. I will thank the witnesses for your valuable testimony and the Members for your questions. Members of the subcommittee may have additional questions for the witnesses, and we would ask the witnesses to respond in writing. Pursuant to committee rule VII(D), the hearing record will be open for 10 days. With that, the hearing is adjourned.  A P P E N D I X I ---------- Questions From Honorable August Pfluger for Simon R. Hankinson Question 1a. The PRC has expanded its activities and influence in Latin America in recent years, financing and developing critical infrastructure and entrapping governments in debt through programs like the Belt and Road Initiative. China has also increased its military ties in Latin America, selling arms and equipment to Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, and other countries in the region. What concerns should we have about China's growing presence in the Western Hemisphere? Answer. Concerns about China's recent activity in the Western Hemisphere are rooted in the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) concerted use of state power across domains. In Latin America, China uses political and economic power with its investment in dual-use infrastructure to serve strategic objectives and facilitate potential future military integration. The Belt and Road Initiative is a key factor, as 21 states in the region hold membership, creating formal inroads to facilitate CCP influence in the region. In Peru, for example, CCP-owned China Southern Power Grid acquired approximately $3 billion in assets from their domestic power grid, leading to 70 percent Chinese control in this sector. Recent Chinese lithium mining investments in Argentina alone total more than $2 billion, and generally speaking China is outcompeting U.S. infrastructure investments in Latin America. New CCP-backed infrastructure projects raise additional concern due to their dual-use and strategic implications. Seventeen Chinese infrastructure projects focused on constructing deep-water ports are now under way in the region, including multiple projects that surround the Panama Canal. Contracts for investment projects are carried out by state-owned companies, such as China Communications Construction (CCC) and China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO), that are informally part of China's expansive military-civil fusion program. Additionally, Chinese companies such as Huawei continue to create inroads through the construction of 4G and 5G telecommunications infrastructure throughout the region. The increased foothold could allow the CCP access to treasure troves of data by virtue of the PRC's 2015 National Security Law, which requires all firms to actively contribute to national security and cooperate with Government requests for information. Question 1b. To what extent do you believe the Chinese Communist Party may be recruiting individuals in these countries to help carry out their influence in the United States? Answer. The CCP is working with Latin American countries to advance Chinese interests in the region at the expense of U.S. security and prosperity. Since the turn of the century, the PLA has conducted over 200 senior leader visits to Latin America and the Caribbean. Last year, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva concluded a visit to China by pledging to work with Beijing to ``rebalance'' global politics and further their joint trading interests. A rebalancing of international systems and norms would benefit Chinese interests at the cost of American interests. Furthermore, the Wall Street Journal reported that Cuba is allowing China to build a surveillance facility for Chinese intelligence services to monitor maritime traffic and electronic communications from the United States. Beyond building ties with political leaders, China is also working to establish a cultural and educational relationship with the Latin American people. China has established at least 39 Confucious institutes in the region, which are Chinese propagandist institutions with known ties to China's security and intelligence agencies. China also awards Hanban scholarships to Latin America's best China scholars, along with free trips to China for academics and journalists, providing additional opportunities for recruitment and intelligence collection. Questions From Honorable August Pfluger for Craig Singleton Question 1. This Congress, the House Homeland Security Committee has led efforts to expose the malign and threatening activity occurring at clandestine Chinese Police Stations in the United States. In April 2023, the FBI arrested two individuals for operating a Chinese police station in Manhattan, New York, where they destroyed evidence, illegally stalked and assaulted people in the United States, conducted transnational repression, and ultimately obstructed justice. Recently, FBI Director Wray said, ``The PRC has made it clear that it considers every sector that makes our society run as fair game in its bid to dominate on the world stage.'' Now, this quote was in reference to civilian and critical infrastructure, but it sounds like they are already targeting the interworking of our civil society. A report in September 2022 revealed the presence of 110 Chinese police stations located around the world. In your opinion, what is the greatest threat posed by these Chinese police stations to U.S. citizens and our national security? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 2a. As we've discussed in this committee before, the Chinese Communist Party has a pattern of engaging in transnational repression and intimidation tactics against Chinese nationals, affiliates, and especially dissidents living in the United States. While this is not a new strategy for the CCP, I imagine it has been exacerbated by the increased presence of potentially malign actors with ties to the CCP crossing our border illegally. Do you believe the increase in transnational repression could be related to irregular, illegal immigration of Chinese nationals, some of whom may have ties to the People's Republic of China? Question 2b. What type of tactics does the CCP use, and do you expect them to continue? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question From Honorable August Pfluger for Todd Bensman Question. The PRC has expanded its activities and influence in Latin America in recent years, financing and developing critical infrastructure and entrapping governments in debt through programs like the Belt and Road Initiative. China has also increased its military ties in Latin America, selling arms and equipment to Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, and other countries in the region. The Associated Press recently reported that short video platforms and messaging apps are being used to provide on-the-ground footage and step-by-step guides from China to the United States, including tips on what to pack, how to survive in the jungle, what hotels and guides to use, how much to bribe police officers in certain countries along the way, and of course, what to do when encountering U.S. immigration officers. Apps like TikTok and Douyin are the primary platforms for this communication. How might these practices be used to facilitate and assist PRC operatives once they are already in the United States? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. A P P E N D I X I I ---------- Statement of Martin Kim, Director, Immigration Advocacy, Asian Americans Advancing Justice--AAJC May 16, 2024 Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Ivey, and Members of the subcommittee, I write today with great concern about how the recent increase in Chinese migration to the Southern Border has been framed by some members of this subcommittee. While there are legitimate and serious criticisms of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Xi Jinping regime, those criticism do not justify the attacks we have seen on immigrants fleeing the repression of the CCP and present a risk to the broader Asian and Pacific Islander (API) community. Asian Americans Advancing Justice--AAJC (``Advancing Justice-- AAJC'') is a national non-profit organization founded in 1991 dedicated to advancing civil and human rights for Asian Americans. We strive to empower Asian American and Pacific Islander communities across the country by bringing local and national constituencies together and advocating for Federal policy that reflects the needs of Asian Americans and promotes a fair and equitable society for all. Advancing Justice--AAJC is the leading national advocate for immigration and anti-racial profiling policy on behalf of the Asian American community, and in this capacity, we work to address the racial profiling and discriminatory targeting of Asian Americans and immigrants. As the subcommittee's invited witnesses noted, the recent increase in Chinese migration is due to a variety of factors, including increased oppression by the CCP and worsening economic conditions within China. These heightened pressures come at a moment when the wait times for Chinese immigrants looking to migrate through other channels have skyrocketed: according to the most recent visa bulletin, and as just one example, Chinese immigrants with approved family petitions who applied 3 to 17 years ago are only now eligible to receive family-based visas.\1\ As might be expected, the increased pressures leading people to leave China combined with the difficulty securing other pathways into the United States has led to a change in the historical migration patterns of this population. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ Visa Bulletin, U.S. Dep't of State, Vol. X, No. 89 (May 2024), https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa- bulletin/2024/visa-bulletin-for-may-2024.html. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Given that the United States is a country that values democracy and individual liberty, it is no surprise that those fleeing repressive environments like the Xi Jinping regime seek to immigrate to the United States. In fact, it is precisely these kinds of immigrants that the United States should welcome. History is filled with examples of immigrants from totalitarian and repressive regimes seeking refuge here, whether they were Jewish immigrants who fled Nazi Germany or those seeking to leave the Soviet Union during the Cold War. We should not look at immigrants, like those from China, coming to the United States from these conditions with automatic suspicion. However, instead of welcoming Chinese immigrants, Members of this subcommittee have called this new Chinese immigration ``illegal'' and claim that these immigrants represent a ``security risk.'' While it is true that the number of Chinese immigrants at the Southern Border has increased, it is important to note that--contrary to the framing of this hearing--seeking asylum at the Southern Border is not illegal: it is a human right enshrined in international \2\ and domestic law.\3\ Chinese immigrants, like other immigrants, have the right to seek asylum here in the United States. Similarly, even though the CCP has engaged in activities seeking to undermine U.S. interests, there is no evidence that all or even a significant proportion of Chinese immigrants have strong ties to the CCP.\4\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \2\ Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, signed July 28, 1951, 189 U.N.T.S. 150 (entered into force April 22, 1954); Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, signed Jan. 31, 1967, 606 U.N.T.S. 267 (entered into force October 4, 1967). \3\ 8 U.S.C.  1158. \4\ Fu Ting, Ali Swenson, and Didi Tang, Trump suggests Chinese migrants are in the US to build an `army.'

The rhetoric and framing deployed in this hearing fails to meaningfully distinguish between the Chinese government and Chinese citizens. Instead, Members of this committee should seek to better understand the nuances that impact migration patterns. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \5\ Viet Thanh Nguyen and Janelle Wong, Bipartisan political rhetoric about Asia leads to anti-Asian violence here, THE WASHINGTON POST (Mar. 19, 2021), https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/atlanta- shooting-political-rhetoric-violence/2021/03/19/f882f8e8-88b9-11eb- 8a8b-5cf82c3dffe4_story.html. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As we have seen time and time again, overbroadly attributing anti- U.S. sentiment to Chinese people is not only a misrepresentation of a diverse group, but also leads to discriminatory blowback against the Asian American community in the United States. Racist stereotypes about Asian American ``foreignness'' and ``disloyalty'' have been used to justify incarceration, assault, and even the murder of our community members. During World War II, unfounded suspicion of Japanese Americans led to the forced incarceration of over 120,000 Japanese Americans by the U.S. Government. In 1982, anti-Japanese sentiment stemming from economic competition in the United States led to the brutal assault and murder of Chinese American Vincent Chin, who was mistaken as a Japanese American. After 9/11, misplaced blame for terrorist attacks fed directly into rampant Islamophobia and violent attacks against Muslim Americans, as well as Sikh and South Asian Americans who were inaccurately perceived to be Muslim. More recently during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, prominent politicians wrongfully attributed the disease to Chinese individuals in our community, leading to a 339 percent increase in reported violent anti-Asian attacks across the United States.\6\ And even more recently, there has been a 180 percent increase in anti-Muslim hate incidents exacerbated by the conflict in Gaza, the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and Israel.\7\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \6\ Kimmy Yam, Anti-Asian hate crimes increased 339 percent nationwide last year, report says, NBCNEWS.COM (Jan. 31, 2022, updated Feb. 14, 2022), https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/anti-asian- hate-crimes-increased-339-percent-nationwide-last-year-repo-rcna14282 (last updated May 22, 2024). \7\ Kanishka Singh, Anti-Muslim incidents jump in US amid Israel- Gaza war, REUTERS (Jan. 29, 2024), https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ anti-muslim-incidents-jump-us-amid-israel-gaza-war-2024-01-29/; Nicquel Terry Ellis and Chandelis Duster, `Anxiety and fear are high:' US Palestinians, Muslims fear a return to post-9/11 Islamophobia, CNN.COM (Oct. 17, 2023), https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/17/us/us-palestinians- muslims-fear-islamophobia-surge-reaj/index.html. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- We agree with the subcommittee that the increase in Chinese immigration to the Southern Border is worthy of attention. We also agree that the threats posed by the Chinese government are real and should be explored. There are ways to do so without painting all API immigrants and Asian Americans as possible threats.\8\ For this reason, we ask that the Members of this subcommittee refrain from inflammatory rhetoric that will only serve to expose our communities to risk and weaken the United States as a whole. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \8\ Asian Americans Advancing Justice/AAJC, Advancing Justice--AAJC Messaging Guidance, https://www.advancingjustice-aajc.org/publication/ advancing-justice-aajc-messaging-guidance (updated Jan. 19, 2024). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ______ Statement of the Niskanen Center May 16, 2024 New data suggests political repression, slowing economy driving irregular Chinese migration to United States introduction Despite intense interest from lawmakers and the media about Chinese migration through the Southern Border, reliable data sources about these migrants are limited. One of the available sources is the annually updated Ecuadorian Statistical Registry of International Entries and Exits. This database offers an invaluable glimpse into the characteristics of Chinese migrants entering Ecuador, the only mainland country in the Western Hemisphere that offers visa-free travel to Chinese nationals. Since most Chinese migrants enter the Americas via Ecuador, these records can reasonably be used to draw inferences about irregular Chinese migration. This assumption is supported by the net entry/exit data, which show that Chinese nationals entered Ecuador 48,381 times in 2023 but only left 24,240 times. The resulting entry/exit deficit was 24,141--by far the highest number of any nationality. Several other data points from the latest release, which summarizes 2023 international entries, further strengthen our knowledge of irregular Chinese migration. For example, U.S. Customs and Border Protection data has shown a sharp increase in encounters with Chinese nationals in recent years. This increase is mirrored by the Ecuadorian travel data, which indicates a record high of 23,859 Chinese nationals traveled to Ecuador at least once in 2023, an increase of almost 235 percent compared to the previous 5-year average.  Some of the new data points, however, complicate our assumptions about who these migrants are. areas experiencing repression remain overrepresented Our analysis of last year's data found that Hong Kong and Xinjiang, which have experienced acute levels of social and political repression by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in recent years, were overrepresented as cities of origin logged in Ecuadorian entry data. This finding is replicated in this year's data, with Hong Kong having the second-highest rate of travel to Ecuador per million and Xinjiang having the sixth.  Hong Kong can be explained to some extent by the region's relatively high economic development, airport presence, and overall population, making regular business travel and overrepresentation in the entry data plausible. However, two consecutive years of high proportional numbers from Xinjiang defy easy explanation. High levels of travel from the prefectures of Aksu and Altay heavily skew Xinjiang's numbers. Aksu is 80 percent Uyghur, while Altay is majority Kazakh--which could indicate that the travelers from this region may not be Han Chinese or at least have first-hand familiarity with the CCP's system of repression in this region. The most reasonable explanation for Xinjiang's high numbers are that residents are especially motivated to escape the repressive CCP security apparatus in the region. However, the numbers from this data set need to be stronger to indicate that persecution is a necessary driver for irregular travel from China to Ecuador. Only two provinces saw no travel to Ecuador in 2022 and 2023: Qinghai, which is only 51 percent Han Chinese, and the Tibetan Autonomous Region, which is 86 percent ethnic Tibetan. Both provinces have experienced large-scale human rights violations but have yet to record the same levels of outbound travel as Xinjiang and Hong Kong. This suggests that other factors outside of possible social, religious, and political concerns are also significant in determining whether a region has a high amount of irregular emigration. declining northeastern regions also high The provinces in China's ``rust belt'' in the northeast have experienced a significant population decline in recent years, losing 30 percent of their population from 2010 to 2020. In this region, despite their plummeting populations, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning are all in the top third of origin regions among Chinese travelers to Ecuador when adjusted for population, as indicated in this table by an asterisk. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2023 Rate of Travel to Region Ecuador per Million ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Shanghai Municipality........................................ 274 Hong Kong Special Administrative Region...................... 257 Beijing Municipality......................................... 161 Heilongjiang Province*....................................... 123 Fujian Province.............................................. 28 Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region............................ 24 Macau Special Administrative Region.......................... 19 Jilin Province*.............................................. 19 Hubei Province............................................... 11 Shaanxi Province............................................. 11 Liaoning Province*........................................... 9 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Author's tabulation of data from Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Censos, Registro Estadistico de Entradas y Salidas 2023. These regional reflections that China's intensifying political persecution and a slowing economy likely contribute to irregular migration are supported by the broader Chinese demographic profile drawn from the Ecuadorian travel data. most travelers male, middle class, under 40 Chinese migrants encountered at the U.S.-Mexico border are often ominously referred to as ``military-aged males.'' This data corroborates the fact that the migrants are largely young and male. In 2023, 71 percent of Chinese entrants to Ecuador were male, and 55 percent were between 15 and 39 years of age. Three factors almost certainly explain these demographics, none indicating a national security risk. First, due to the one-child policy, China has a significant gender imbalance that has left many men struggling to find women they could marry. The pressure created by this imbalance has already created a market for trafficking within China, and it is reasonable to assume that young Chinese men could be motivated to undertake the journey if they believe it will make it easier to find a spouse. Second, social media has made the otherwise logistically daunting journey far more manageable and appealing, and young people are more likely to feel comfortable using social media to navigate the journey. Finally, middle-class young men in China are the demographic most likely to have the means and capability to organize and complete the expensive and grueling route to the United States via Ecuador. Occupational data from entrants to Ecuador corroborate this explanation: Almost 80 percent were either high- or middle-skilled professionals, while less than 1 percent (and only 2 in total) listed ``military'' as their field of work.  conclusion There is no singular characteristic that explains why increasing numbers of asylum seekers from China are presenting themselves at the Southern Border. Stifling political repression, a slowing Chinese economy, the emergence of social media as a conduit for irregular travel, and a perceived limited window of opportunity are all mutually- compounding factors that together make the record 24,376 encounters with Chinese nationals recorded by U.S. CBP in fiscal year 2024 to date easier to comprehend. One popular explanation favored by some commentators is that these Chinese migrants are spies. As we have explained before, this interpretation is highly dubious. American policy makers interested in effectively rolling back the CCP should instead reject their assumption that any ethnic Chinese person owes them fealty and aggressively promote practical, bipartisan solutions that protect anti-communist dissidents and advance American Democracy as an alternative worldview. Olivia Enos at the Hudson Institute has convincingly made the case for stepping up enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, and the Global Magnitsky Act to target CCP human rights violations. At the level of immigration policy, the United States should better enable Chinese dissidents to access our refugee system. This can be done by passing the Uyghur Human Rights Protection Act and the Hong Kong Safe Harbor Act, which would allow dissidents from these areas to enjoy Priority Two (P-2) processing in the refugee resettlement system, allowing them to enter the United States refugee program without a referral from the UNHCR, an embassy, or an NGO. Despite their authoritarian structure, the CCP does not control the narrative over irregular Chinese migration to the United States. Whether the United States decides to shape this narrative before it shapes us in the eyes of people seeking freedom in China, East Asia, and the world is up to us.
