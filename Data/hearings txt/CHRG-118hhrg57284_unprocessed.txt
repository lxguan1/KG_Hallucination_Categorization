DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION BUDGET REQUEST WITNESS HON. PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY, DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Mr. Womack. The subcommittee will come to order. Welcome to our first subcommittee hearing of the fiscal year 2025 Appropriation season, and my first hearing as chairman of this subcommittee. Thank you. Right on cue, Mike. I'm deeply honored to lead this piece of the Appropriations Committee with potentially the most direct impact on each congressional district across the United States, including my own. Today we welcome the testimony from the Honorable Pete Buttigieg, Secretary of the Department of Transportation implementation on the fiscal year 2025 budget. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, for appearing before us today and for your service to this country. I know I've said it to you before, but as a former mayor myself, I appreciate that we have such a successful Mayor at the helm of the DOT, and I mean that. The Department of Transportation is requesting $25.5 billion in discretionary budget authority for fiscal year 2025, coupled with the $36.8 billion in advanced appropriations provided by the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act. The IIJA and the nearly 81 billion from the Highway Trust fund. DOT is seeking $143 billion in total resources. In total, the IIJA provides 184 billion in advance of program appropriations from 2022 to 2026. Let me remind you, these appropriations are under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee. As such, we will continue to subject the IIJA appropriations to strong oversight as we develop the fiscal 2025 bill. Mr. Secretary, I look forward to working with you to prioritize our Nation's vital infrastructure and transportation needs in Arkansas's third district and across the country, while safeguarding hard working the hard earned taxpayer dollars of our citizens. I know our work on this subcommittee impacts the safety, economic opportunity, and the quality of life of every American, a duty I take seriously. Even as we work to rein in excessive spending, let me assure you that safety will remain our top priority for the subcommittee as we prepare the 2025 bill. From the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse to the East Palestine Trail derailment, to the close calls happening far too often at our airports, you can see the importance of safe transportation systems. We will continue to provide appropriate levels of support to DOT programs that ensure the safety of our skies, our roads, and our railroads. I want to work with you, Mr. Secretary, to ensure that our states and localities are getting the most bang for their buck out of this infusion of federal support for infrastructure. We cannot expect these unprecedented levels of funding to continue in perpetuity, which means the grants being delivered now need to be an effective use of taxpayer dollars. Burdensome 100 page applications and an immense web of new regulatory requirements is not helpful to grantees trying to get shovels in the ground. I also want to ensure that the impacts of these unprecedented levels in investment continue to be felt by all districts around the country, not just the large urban areas. I recognize the mega projects that have been needed for a long time in our big cities, but Arkansas's third district and rural areas around the Nation need a level playing field. I look forward to your testimony today in working with you to ensure that the department can continue to deliver on its mission to ensure a safe and modern transportation system. The jurisdiction of this subcommittee is one of the most unique of the Appropriations Committee as it impacts its impacts are seen in every single congressional district. As such, we have a history of bipartisanship that I look forward to continuing as we begin the fiscal 2025 appropriations process. I'd now like to recognize my good friend and the ranking member from Illinois, Mr. Quigley, for his opening statement. Mike. Mr. Quigley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. For those who did not know, we had a very strong bipartisan partnership during a time where we flipped and did both chair and ranking members of the FSGG subcommittee. I look forward to carrying on that tradition on the T-HUD subcommittee. And I must recognize from Rogers, Arkansas to South Bend, Indiana, America's mayors are the cradle of leadership. So, Mr. Secretary, welcome back. You've been a great partner over the years, and I appreciate your continued commitment to work with this committee to strengthen our transportation networks. Overall, the budget request dedicates nearly $10.9 billion--$109 billion to sustain our transportation networks and protect the safety of our transportation workers. This investment includes hiring 2,000 additional air traffic controllers to keep our skies and runways safe and efficient, $2.4 billion to expand bus and rapid transit to help everyday Americans travel to work, school and health appointments, and more than $3 billion to prevent collisions, improve worker safety and perform signal and traffic upgrade track upgrades on our rail systems. These investments, combined with those made during the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, will ensure that whether it flies, floats, or rolls, advancements in safety and modernization of our transportation can be made in this decade. These targeted investments will help accelerate transportation safety, resiliency and mobility improvements while prioritizing lengthy and costly capital backlogs that propel the sophistication of America's transportation networks. Yet and still emergencies and unforeseen circumstances happen, and this subcommittee should be prepared to help our federal partners respond. Ensuring agencies such as DOT have the resources and flexibility necessary to deploy and rapidly respond to accidents, near incursions, or major catastrophe in real time is vital. We must continue to invest in solutions to create more resilient supply chain networks, workforce pipelines, and multimodal reliability. Revisiting the emergence of these needs each year through the annual appropriation process is critical. I look forward to working with the Chairman and you, Mr. Secretary, in getting to fiscal year 2025 agreement that adheres to the Fiscal Responsibility Act requirements without compromising the future of America's transportation system. We look forward to your testimony today, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Womack. I thank the gentleman from Illinois, and he is correct, we had a terrific working relationship over at financial services and general government. Look forward to continuing that relationship here today. The overall chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Cole, had intended to be here today, but I think everybody knows he's facing a disaster in his own district with tornadoes a couple of days ago, and he is there attending to matters in his district in Oklahoma. Without objection, his prepared remarks will be included in the record. And now I'd like to recognize my good friend from the great state of Connecticut and the ranking member on appropriations, Ms. DeLauro. Ms. DeLauro. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Womack, ranking member Quigley. Thank you both for holding this hearing. Congratulations to you, Chairman Womack, on your first hearing as chair of the subcommittee, and you are indeed a great friend. I want to say a thank you to you, Secretary Buttigieg, for being here today, for all that you have done to streamline and improve the travel experience throughout our airports, rail systems, and other transportation modes, and for your role in overseeing all the work underway across this country, rebuilding American infrastructure. And that is thanks to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. I know we all wish we were joined in this hearing by the new Chair of the full committee and the previous chair of this subcommittee, Chairman Cole. But as the chair remarked, he's unable to be here. But we pray for a swift recovery for the communities across Oklahoma that are impacted by the recent tornadoes. For hardworking Americans, business travel, daily commutes, hard earned leisure travel, everything in between, life in America requires safe and efficient ways of connecting. Americans deserve the safest, most advanced systems in the world, across all forms of transportation. Our transportation infrastructure is central to the health and to the well-being of all of our communities. It connects everyone, urban, suburban, rural areas, to their jobs, schools, grocery stores, and the care that they depend on. And the work of your department, together with this subcommittee, ensures every American has access to reliable, safe, and efficient transportation. As Americans travel in greater numbers than ever before, we have seen our transportation infrastructure really put to the test. Massive air travel disruptions, catastrophic train derailments, elevated pedestrian fatality rates, emphasize the work to improve our transportation systems is never, never ending. And together, over the past three years, through this committee's annual investments and in the bipartisan infrastructure law, we have done so much to repair our transportation infrastructure. But the progress must continue. In the 2024 government funding package, this committee made robust investments in the safety and durability of our transportation infrastructure. We created and sustained tens of thousands of good paying American jobs with investments in airports, highways, transit systems systems, passenger rail, and in our ports. We made targeted investments to improve our transportation system safety, cut emissions, increase resiliency, address inequities, and fight the climate crisis while generating economic opportunities for working and middle class families. And we protected the bipartisan infrastructure law, ensuring that the legislation's generational investments continue to complement the work that your department does on an annual basis. To build on the success, the president's request for DOT includes $25.7 billion in discretionary funding to create safer, more equitable, and more modern transportation systems. Critically, the budget calls for an additional $1.7 billion in funding for the Federal Aviation Administration, which desperately needs to bolster staffing, modernize its systems to keep up with the historic rates at which Americans are traveling through the skies. The budget also invests in the Federal Railroad Administration for infrastructure and safety enhancements and to assure that Amtrak is able to meet the needs and demands of the public, which is increasingly looking for rail options to meet their travel needs. Just as an aside, Mr. Secretary, I ride Amtrak twice a week, and it's always crowded. It really is full, and it is a great and wonderful, safe way to travel, and we thank you for that. I know you believe, like I do, that investing in our transportation infrastructure is one of the best ways to supercharge the American economy. We get an extraordinary return on our investment dollar when we connect communities, facilitate commerce, and draw Americans closer together by building modern, fast, and safe transportation systems. So it's wonderful to have you here with us this morning. We thank you for all of your work. Look forward to your testimony. And with that, I want to say a thank you to Chairman Womack and ranking member Quigley, and I yield back. Mr. Womack. Thank the gentlelady. Mr. Secretary, this is the first hearing of the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development subcommittee in this cycle of appropriations, and I cannot think of a more appropriate first witness than the Secretary of Transportation. And with that, sir, the floor is yours, and we'll accept your opening statement. Secretary Buttigieg. Well, thanks very much, Chairman. And let me add to the congratulations for your taking on this leadership role. We're looking forward to working with you, and our whole department feels the same way. Likewise, I want to acknowledge and congratulate Chairman Cole, and our thoughts are certainly with the communities impacted that he's with right now. So with that, Chair, ranking member Quigley, ranking member DeLauro, and all of the members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss President Biden's fiscal year 2025 budget request for our Department of Transportation, and thank you for your partnership as we have delivered safer, stronger transportation across every mode and across the United States. Roadway fatalities are at last trending downward, shipping costs are down as supply chains run more smoothly, and airline cancellations last year were the lowest in a decade. As you all know, we also have much more to do. We are rebuilding not just from the pandemic, but from decades of disinvestment and an enforcement environment that, in our view, for too long, privileged corporations instead of protecting people. The President's budget request, totaling $146.2 billion, builds on the progress that we've made and enables us to deliver on the important challenges and opportunities that remain. I'll start with our primary mission across every mode, which is safety. On our roads, we have funded projects in every state to improve safety for all travelers. After years of heading in the wrong direction, we've now had seven consecutive quarters of declining deaths on America's roadways. But this remains a national crisis, taking over 40,000 lives a year. And we're requesting $72 billion to improve America's roads and bridges with an emphasis on safety and efficiency. We are constantly reminded of the importance of transportation safety. The country watched in shock as a cargo ship struck and destroyed the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, taking six lives and closing a vital port. We're working across the Biden- Harris administration and with state, local, and private sector partners to help reopen that port as quickly as possible. We also immediately got to work with the state on the first steps toward rebuilding the bridge. With regard to aviation, America was rightly alarmed when a door blew out of an Alaska Airlines flight in January. The FAA acted swiftly to ground 737 MAX-9 aircraft until each plane was safe to return to the air. And the FAA is significantly increasing oversight of Boeing. The agency is also investing in the physical infrastructure, staffing, and technology of our national airspace and airports, requesting $26.8 billion for the FAA, which will support oversight of aircraft production, accelerate the modernization of the National Airspace System, increase the target to hire 2,000 air traffic controllers and continue improving airports. On our rails, we're modernizing infrastructure, fixing road-rail crossings and improving service in places like Chicago; Moore, Oklahoma; and between New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, just to name a few. We are requesting $16.4 billion, which, in addition to expanding and improving rail service, will allow us to increase the number of safety inspectors to 400 and add new staff to complete safety audits. We recently finalized the rule for safe train crew sizes, establishing what most Americans assumed was already the case, which is a minimum of two crew members generally applying to large freight trains. Indeed, we're taking every step that does not require an act of Congress. But we are also continuing to call on Congress to pass the bipartisan Railway Safety Act that would provide much needed authorities to keep passengers, workers, and communities safe. Across the country, we are repairing and replacing what existed in building and modernizing for the future. Last week, I was in Las Vegas for the groundbreaking of the new rail line from southern California to Las Vegas, which will, we expect, be the first true high-speed rail line in service in the United States. It was a very good day--for the millions of Americans who will ride that train every year; for our truck drivers and supply chains that will benefit from less congested highways; for everyone across the country who will live in a climate with 800 million fewer pounds of carbon pollution annually. But it is more than each of those separate benefits. It's a celebration of the idea that America can still build massive, forward-looking engineering marvels that make people's lives better--with the potential of many more to come. That one project is creating good union jobs for 1,000 men and women who will maintain and operate the train line, plus another 10,000 good union construction jobs to build it. And everywhere I go, I meet workers already benefiting from these jobs. I think of workers like a young veteran I met in Washington State who reminded me of so many people that I got to know in uniform now facing the challenges of building a civilian life. He talked about what it was like coming off active duty as a marine, how hard it was to get on his feet as a civilian. And then he said, ``I came across this union, the amount of training I got, the amount of work stability, the level I have to conduct myself at, the purpose I have . . . prevented me from becoming a statistic.'' And now he is the first person in his family to own a house. Everywhere we're meeting people who remind us what it means to have these kinds of jobs. These benefits are being multiplied across tens of thousands of projects, including construction workers building livelihoods as they modernize America's infrastructure, helping us build stronger supply chains, cleaner air, and safer, more affordable ways for every American to get where they need to go. We're making good progress, but there's more to do. And we look forward to working with this committee to continue delivering for every community in the country. Thanks very much. And I look forward to our discussion. Mr. Womack. Thank you, sir. We'll now begin the Q and A portion of this hearing. Let me remind everybody, strict adherence to the five minute rule should be noted that sometime in the next hour and ten or 15 minutes, we'll have votes called. We will make a game time decision at that time about whether we break for votes and come back. The Secretary has been very generous with his time, and we'll have to kind of sort out where we are in the rounds before we determine that. And some of that will be influenced by how many members are expecting to return for potentially a second round of questions. So I'll recognize myself first. And not surprisingly, we're going to talk a little bit about the Baltimore Bridge. Mr. Secretary, a couple of weeks ago, I had a chance to sit down with my friend, Governor Wes Moore of Maryland, to express my support to Maryland in its recovery efforts after the Baltimore Bridge collapse. Chairman Cole and I and other members of this subcommittee and others will get to see those efforts firsthand this coming Thursday when we take a trip there. I want to take this opportunity to send my condolences, and I speak on behalf of this entire subcommittee in expressing our condolences to the families of the workers who perished in the line of duty and convey my sincere appreciation to the first responders who kept this event from being a bigger tragedy and to the men and women who are working it night and day to clear the wreckage and reopen the port of Baltimore. I understand the goal is to restore full service to the port by the end of May. I was pleased to see that more temporary channels have opened recently and ahead of schedule to allow bigger ships to leave and enter the port. Along those lines, Mr. secretary, give us an update on the status of the full reopening of the port, what the impact on the economy and supply chain has been, and what your department has done to help the truckers, the shippers, and other industries affected by its closure. Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you, Chairman, and thank you for your and this committee's attention to that situation. And certainly was glad to hear that you and other members of the subcommittee will be visiting, will participate in that visit, as hosted by Governor Moore. The port of Baltimore is essential to the regional economy, and it plays an important role in the national supply chain as well, especially given its specialization in the transit of vehicles, and then the bridge itself, which provides such a vital connection for people and goods--obviously missing that has a substantial impact, or about 30,000 vehicles crossing that bridge on a daily basis. We got to work right away, as soon as we got those calls in the middle of the night, and have been working with Maryland throughout to try to help them get back to normal. That's included the immediate availability of $60 million in quick release emergency relief funds for the Maryland DOT. We view that as a down payment on what we know will be the substantial cost of building a new bridge. With regard to the opening of the channel, I can tell you that while that limited access, deep draft channel was opened, that allowed for 19 total transits--ten outbound ships (some vessels were effectively stuck there because of the wreckage), as well as nine inbound--and made it possible for more of the workers in that port to be able to do what they do best. The Army Corps of Engineers is projecting that they are on track, as I understand it, for that May opening timeline of the full channel, and that really is necessary. Even that 38-foot channel is not enough to accommodate the largest vessels and get the port and the workers who count on it back to normal. Briefly, I would just also note that through our Port Infrastructure Development Program, we were able to make funds available for paving of a cargo laydown area at a facility called Trade Point, which is one of the few parts of the port that is outside and not inside of the channel that was obstructed by the wreckage of the bridge. My understanding is that that is already now helping to move some cargo. And I would note that we continue to be in regular contact both on the supply chain side through our new multimodal freight office and our Maritime Administration, and then on the bridge rebuilding side through our Federal Highway Administration and have conveyed our Department's echo the President's commitment that Baltimore and Maryland will have everything that they need on the federal side. Mr. Womack. We'll have some other questions that we'll submit for the record on the Baltimore Bridge, and I'm sure they will follow our visit up there on Thursday. Real quickly, in my last minute, the fiscal 2024 Appropriations Act included $12 million to start the recapitalization of the National Defense Reserve Fleet, which is appropriate project designed to help us in the Navy meet specifications and build that design out of an American shipyard. Can you give us an update on the status of this project and the timeline to get a contract awarded in these remaining 45 seconds? Secretary Buttigieg. I'll do my best to be brief and knowing that you'll have our Maritime Administrator before you soon, I'll just note that we take great pride in helping to fulfill that important defense mission with the ready reserve fleet and are working to recapitalize it using the resources that were provided, while candidly noting that it has been a challenge to recapitalize the vessels as quickly as they are going out of date. But my understanding is that we are on track to proceed with that, and we'll be happy to invite the Maritime Administrator to provide a more fulsome update when there's the opportunity later today. Mr. Womack. Thank you, Mr. Quigley. Mr. Quigley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to associate myself with the remarks the Chairman made about the tragedy in Baltimore and the families who lost loved ones there. But I think we need to have an honest discussion here about the emergency relief fund. Going into this there was a significant backlog and recognizing that disasters like this can and do happen, but the severity, the number and severity of natural disasters as well wearing on our resources is significant. So we need to have this discussion because there's not enough in that fund. And we can argue, oh, we want to cut spending. Well, if disasters happen, they disproportionately impact one area that simply cannot handle this, but they do impact the country. So if you could give us, Mr. Secretary, a deeper understanding of the status of the emergency relief fund, how you envision a supplemental at least addressing this Baltimore disaster, but perhaps also the fact that we have a backlog and that we need to recognize that that spigot, that fund, has to be larger every year, just to be honest with ourselves, that it needs more money. Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you for the question and for your attention to the Emergency Relief Program, which we know is so important anytime there is an incident affecting transportation, like the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. For perspective, in terms of the proportions that are in play, in May of 2023, FHWA provided $749 million in ER program funds to help 39 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico make repairs for roads and bridges that had been damaged by storms, floods, wildfires and other events. In January 2024, Federal Highways provided $729 million in the ER program funds to help 34 states, as well as DC, the US Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. The last update I got showed $950 million available in that fund. But we're tracking approximately $2 billion of unmet need, and that is not including the projected cost of the Francis Scott Key Bridge. Now, to be clear, that does not necessarily mean that we would have $2 billion of requests ready to go looking for reimbursement in a single year. Mr. Quigley. What is that $2 billion? Secretary Buttigieg. So that's effectively a pipeline that will then be reimbursed as the states are ready and do their spending. We've had some cases where just because of the length of time it takes to do reconstruction, checks may be going out five or even more years after the original incident, just through the flow of the project. But what we do see is there is a mismatch between the $950 million and the $2 billion plus and counting that we see by way of need. And so, we would welcome support on ways to make sure that that fund is adequately topped up, knowing that severe weather is becoming more severe and more frequent, not less. And that even though we are separately working through programs like Protect to make our infrastructure more resilient in the first place against the kinds of threats that weather, natural disasters, and other effects can cause, we still are facing an uphill struggle and are going to need to do everything we can to be ready on the back end to respond when disaster strikes. Mr. Quigley. So if we equate this, as we often do, with a household, it's like operating without insurance, in a sense, and disasters do happen. What is the probable need for supplemental? And if we're going to go to that expense, what would it take to fill that fund with a reasonable amount of money, an endowment, in a sense, to not have to have a, you know, a wanting a wait for a supplemental when the next disaster takes place? Secretary Buttigieg. Well, I'd certainly concur that it would be optimal to know that the fund is being refreshed at a rate that keeps up with the needs that have come to it. Again, if we're using recent years as an index, we would see the last 2 years' disbursements would have been between $700 and $800 million, but we know there is even more, and you would want, given the Francis Scott Key Bridge, you would want some kind of cushion there. So, while we have not proposed a specific supplemental at this time, that gives you a sense of the proportion that we think would be needed in order to make sure the ER fund was at a healthy level, and, of course, would also spare us needing to go to supplementals in the future if we knew that there were adequate balances for the unmet need that was coming in. Mr. Quigley. No, again. And those details are matters. So, again, making sure the committee knows for the future, what would it take to get the fund at a healthy level to address the needs as they hit, and what would be a normal, appropriate amount to fund that spigot every year? Thank you. Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you. You know, being authorized at $100 million a year and then periodically being supplemented by Congress, we can work with that. But a cushion that's more in the line of the levels that we've found ourselves dispersing in recent years would help us to stay ahead of that and reduce the need for supplementals or additional work outside of the regular budget cycle. Mr. Womack. Sheriff Rutherford. Mr. Rutherford. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Secretary, great to see you again, and thank you for being here this morning. One of the things that I want to bring up is this issue of vehicle technology and cybersecurity. You know, these new connective vehicles, as they're called, particularly in light of the fact that China has emerged now as the largest exporter of vehicles globally, including here in the United States. And, Mr. Secretary, I have to tell you, I'm concerned about the potential security risk of these connected vehicles built by the Chinese automakers and now operating in the United States because through their massive subsidies and workforce practices, as I said, they've become the largest exporter. They're here. And these vehicles literally have the capability of being manipulated and manipulating the vehicle's life and safety systems, collect and transmit data, and implement surveillance capabilities embedded within the vehicle's technology. Now, I know the select committee on the Chinese Communist Party has sent a letter to the Department of Commerce and the Department of Defense issuing those concerns about these vehicles. Can you talk a little bit about what DOT, maybe NHTSA, whoever, can really help here in America, ensure, like the Chinese are doing? If you--any vehicle data collected in China has to be stored locally. Are we required anything like that? Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you for the question. It touches on something we take very seriously, which is the safety implications of vehicle cybersecurity issues. The reality is that vehicles are becoming more and more complex and more and more software intensive each passing year. There's already probably been more computerization on board than many consumers were aware of, but that is only increasing. NHTSA was involved in establishing a body called the Auto ISAC, an industry data sharing partnership which is committed to quickly identifying and responding to cybersecurity risks and threats in the Nation's vehicle fleet. And NHTSA has refreshed its own updated cybersecurity best practices, which we also believe is a contribution to this issue, working with a number of stakeholders and also updating a cybersecurity incident response plan, which makes more clear the agency's responsibilities in the event of a cyberattack or any issue that would involve safety critical systems there. I think that going forward, we need to continue assessing how best to protect consumers without, of course, hindering the technological developments that can make vehicles safer, more convenient. There's a lot of consumer demand for this. Mr. Rutherford. But excuse me, did they say anything about collecting data here locally, keep it in America, as opposed to going back to the CCP? Secretary Buttigieg. I'm not aware of restrictions in terms of how data is stored. Of course, most of our international automakers are not Chinese automakers. But you also know how many different components are finding their way into any vehicle, regardless of the OEM. So that's certainly an area that we'd welcome more dialogue on and be eager to work on. Mr. Rutherford. Okay, thank you. I'd like to flip over to the EV standards and really talk about the cafe standards that have recently been announced that everyone is, I do not want to say. Well, I might say up in arms about because nowhere in law did Congress authorize DOT to set fuel economy standards that effectively mandate EVs, while at the same time will force the internal combustion engine out of the market. In fact, Mr. Secretary, federal statute expressly prohibits NHTSA from considering the fuel economy of EVs when determining maximum feasible cafe standards for passenger cars and trucks. Now, can you give me a little update on the cafe standards? What are they finally going to boil down to? And how does DOT plan to implement such as such a massive move to EVs without consumer buy in, really? Because as we've all seen, so few really want to buy them at this point. Secretary Buttigieg. Well, I do think it's important to note that every year more Americans choose EVs than the year before. And very few Americans who choose an EV decide to go back. But I do want to agree and note that, as you correctly stated, NHTSA does not take EVs into account when it's formulating CAFE standards. They're about the quality of an internal combustion engine. The rule that was proposed would require a fleet-wide average of 58 miles per gallon by 2032. I know that seems aggressive, but frankly, every CAFE---- Mr. Rutherford. To say the least. Secretary Buttigieg. Yeah, but that's exactly what they said when we outrageously suggested that you could get 20 miles a gallon back in the eighties or nineties. So every time we raise the bar, we find that industry is able to meet it. And it's remarkable the innovation that goes on. But ultimately, we believe these are about not just cleaner air, but saving Americans money by having more efficient gas engines. And we know that these gas cars are going to be on the road a long time, even as the EV market share grows, which is part of why we continue to think it's important to meet our statutory responsibility with the CAFE standards. Mr. Rutherford. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield back, Mr. Chair. Mr. Womack. Ms. Watson Coleman. Ms. Watson Coleman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And congratulations to you. I look forward to working with you. It's good to see you, Mr. Secretary. It's always good to see you. Thank you for your visit to New Jersey. Let's make it happen again. You know, through the funding from both the bipartisan infrastructure and the budget, your department has been able to provide really good union jobs to many people in this country. Uplifting our working class families while lifting them up is vitally important. It's also very important that we are inclusive. And for those communities which have been marginalized, particularly black and brown we want to make sure that they are reaping the benefit of this wonderful work under this administration. Can you please discuss the Department of Transportation's ongoing efforts to ensure that members of historically marginalized communities, again, especially black and brown and even women in nontraditional jobs, are being included in the efforts to uplift the Americas working class? Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you. This continues to be a very important consideration for us. And as we advance initiatives like the President's Justice40 Commitment, always, of course, being mindful of the statutory authority behind it, we believe we continue to have extraordinary opportunities to lift up communities that have been passed over or in some cases even harmed by the transportation decisions of past generations. And we know that when we do that, nobody is made worse off and a lot of people are better off. In terms of how we can best do that, that has included measures like technical assistance to help communities that are not wealthy enough to have, sometimes, the most well-heeled federal relations organizations, for example, still be able to compete and win in our discretionary grant processes. It means, to the extent permitted by statute, considering the areas of persistent poverty or other factors that have placed an area at a disadvantage, and generally ensuring that all community voices are heard in the proposals for projects that are coming forward. And I really believe that we are turning a corner as a country in terms of how we make sure that federal dollars benefit everybody and not just the fewer, the well-off. Ms. Watson Coleman. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. How is the department measuring the success of those efforts? Secretary Buttigieg. Well, this is . . . first of all, again, I would point to Justice40 because that has set a clear goal for us as an administration, and that is being tracked not just in our Department, but on a government-wide basis. The White House has updated its covered program list, and 40 of those programs are in the US DOT alone. And they're subject to a level of data gathering that can help us understand the impacts of the choices that we're making. We're also making sure that we just track the level of projects that are moving through the different stages to make sure that those are in lower-capacity or lower-wealth communities are not systematically encountering more issues. We know that can happen just because they have sometimes fewer resources, less experience working with federal programs. And we're actively engaging those who do not succeed in some of our applications through debriefs, knowing that often it's on a third or a second or third attempt that a community, especially a low- income community, can successfully get these kinds of federal funds. Ms. Watson Coleman. So what is it that you all are doing to be able to demonstrate whether or not you're being successful in accomplishing what I believe is your noble and genuine goal? My issue has always been working in this field myself years ago that we put in these good faith efforts, but we missed the mark when it comes time to actually showing where the dollars went, where the contracts went. So how are we measuring that, sir? What is your department doing to collect that information, and is it available for us to peruse? Secretary Buttigieg. So I certainly agree that often we see the phrase ``good faith effort'' used, but we do not always see the results. So we've held ourselves to a higher standard, beginning with the dollars that we have the most visibility and control over, which is, of course, our direct contracting dollars. There we set a 20 percent goal. We're transparent about how we're doing on that, and I'm pleased to report we've exceeded that goal, and we're thinking about how to take it higher in terms of the proportion of grants that go to SDBs, small and disadvantaged businesses. We're likewise encouraging our project sponsors, who of course handle the bulk of the money--states, cities, airport authorities, transit agencies-- to do the same. And our recently revised DBE and ACDBE rule contains provisions to make sure we have good data going forward, too. The balance we're trying to strike, of course, is we do not want to make it harder for those very same businesses with overly burdensome data reporting requirements, but we do want to make sure we have and can publish enough data to really see how we're doing in that regard and would be happy to share with your office more granular numbers, especially about the progress we've made in our own contracting. Ms. Watson Coleman. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Mr. Womack. Mr. Gonzales. Mr. Gonzales. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Secretary. Texas has the greatest increase in population than any other state in the country. And I was a little shocked to learn that the chairman of TXDOT has not had an opportunity to meet you and have a conversation with you. Would you be willing to get on a call with myself, your team, and the Chairman of TXDOT? An introductory call? Secretary Buttigieg. Sure. I'd be happy to. I typically engage with leaders of state DOTS in the context of AASHTO, but if there's a more specific issue, we can work, or if you would just like to arrange an introduction, I'd be happy to do that. Mr. Gonzales. Fantastic. Thank you for that, Mr. Secretary. San Antonio, Texas is home to one of the largest military populations in the Nation. As a 20 year Navy veteran, it is critical. I know that it is critical that we equip our military personnel with the tools they need to succeed. One of those tools is travel, and we have yet to see a direct flight added to the DCA to San Antonio. There are a significant number of personnel that travel back and forth from San Antonio to our Nation's capital. It is critical that we have that we make this as painless as possible for our men and women in uniform. Currently, there are discussions about adding a direct flight between San Antonio and DCA. I'm in full support of that. My question for you is, do you believe it is important for our military men and women to have direct access to our Nation's capital? Secretary Buttigieg. Well, having traveled on orders myself, I certainly recognize and appreciate the importance of good air travel and other travel options for our military members. Mr. Gonzales. Excellent. My next question is, my district is massive. It's larger than the State of Pennsylvania. I have 29 counties. 27 of those counties are rural. Livestock plays a very important role in our economy. For years, livestock has been relied on, has relied on an exemption to the electronic logging device ELD rule. Without these exceptions for livestock carriers, there is a risk of animals being left without proper grazing accommodations or becoming subject to other health risks. Mr. Secretary, do you have any, do you have any plans to grant an exception to livestock haulers for the ELD rules in fiscal year 2025? Secretary Buttigieg. Certainly, I'm aware of the unique issues that livestock haulers face. When you have living cargo, it's a little bit different than boxes and inanimate objects, and I think that's contemplated in the practices of FMCSA. I'm not aware of any change to the current practice that is forthcoming in terms of some of the flexibilities. Of course, what we're trying to do is balance the importance of livestock with the importance of safety. And those ELDs are there for safety reasons. But we continually seek to strike the right balance, to be reasonable in our flexibilities, and yet demonstrate our commitment to the life safety issues that are implicated in any of our regulations with FMCSA. Mr. Gonzales. Excellent. I also represent a large part of the Texas-Mexico border, nearly half of the overall Texas- Mexico border. And trade and commerce is a big part of that. You know, big function of trade and commerce is the infrastructure that builds out to that and the level of different roads. And I'd ask that you take a look at that as we, as we're reviewing, you know, updating USMCA and some of these other trade partnerships. It's so critical that we have the infrastructure built out right as we nearshore from other places, not only nearshore to America, but also North America. I think it's critical that we, we look to, you know, our partners to the south and how do we have this infrastructure once again built out. We cannot just turn a switch off and turn it on without that investment in there. So I look forward to working with you and your team on these projects and others, and thank you once again for coming before the committee, and I look forward to that call. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Womack. Thank you Tony. Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you very much. Mr. Womack. Ms. Torres. Ms. Torres. Thank you Chairman. And I also want to congratulate you on your new position. I hope that you are kind to us when it comes to community projects. Mr. Womack. I started by getting your name right. Ms. Torres. Yes. Thank you. Secretary, it's really great to see you again and I really look forward to hosting you in my district when the Brightline project finishes. And I hope that you and I and my colleague here can work together to ensure that, you know, we move this project as fast as a train will travel. So, you know, on time, on budget, all of that. As you know, I represent SoCal's Inland empire. You visited my district a couple of years ago and we were fortunate to receive a $15 million award for a pedestrian bridge that was so desperately needed. We are the suburbs of workers that work in Los Angeles and, you know, they travel to 40, 50, 60 miles one way to work. I represent a freight corridor, so anything that happens at the port of LA and Long Beach impact my district, Alameda corridor runs and splits my district in half. So you can imagine the needs that we have, as you have seen them yourself. In fiscal year 2023 funding package, I secured a transit oriented development pilot program with over $13 million of funding. It's a pilot program. Transit oriented development is important, as you know, for bringing transit and affordable housing together, which is what we desperately need in the Inline empire. Can you provide us an update on the department's transit oriented development pilot program? And have you worked with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to ensure that we are coordinating the goal of this pilot program? Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you. And the short answer on working with HUD is yes. I've spoken with both Acting Secretary Todman and before that Secretary Fudge about this because we recognize the relationship between housing affordability and transportation options, specifically with regard to the program. Just recently, in fact, earlier this month, FTA announced $17.6 million in grants going to 20 communities in 16 States to support equitable transit-oriented development. And the goal is to again try to integrate our thinking about what are the two biggest costs for most households taken together, housing and transportation. The overall funding for that program is $68.9 million provided by the IIJA, which is a substantial increase over the prior five years. I would also note that we have credit programs in the Build America Bureau, which can also be used to support transit-oriented development. We hope to be able to make an announcement in the coming days about a project that will go forward based on that. So we certainly believe in the importance of transit solutions to help with housing affordability, and welcome the opportunity to continue working to bring that to your constituents. Ms. Torres. Thank you. Thank you so much. This pilot program was so successful that I look forward to working with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to put it into law to ensure that we continue to support. By the way, the 16 States that received this funding, in communities across those 16 States, none of them were from SoCal's Inland empire. We did not apply. And we did not apply because, again, what you talked about in your opening statement, the need for assistance in filling out these lengthy applications, I cannot stress to you how much we need to ensure that we simplify the processes, that we simplify the reporting options that we have currently available for our communities, because they just, it is not sustainable for smaller cities like the ones that I represent. I also want to ask if you have a status on another program that we funded, and that's the regional infrastructure Accelerator, a program that was created for the development of regional projects to get cities to work together? Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you. Yes, that's also part of the Build America Bureau that I mentioned earlier. That program accelerates project delivery and helps clear barriers. In October, we were able to announce another step forward, thereby expanding the RIA program to 24 accelerators, receiving $24 million in new funding, and we look forward to continuing to develop that program. Also, with regard to your earlier note, I appreciate the opportunity to mention our belief in the thriving communities program and how that has helped link many of these communities up to support for navigating those sometimes challenging federal processes. Ms. Torres. Mayors get things done, and with that, I yield back. Mr. Womack. Amen. Thank you, and amen. Mr. Valadao. Mr. Valadao. Thank you, Chair. Thank you, Secretary, for your time today. I really appreciate you taking some time to be with us today. Mr. Secretary, the State of California has adopted a regulation targeting emissions of locomotives, and they are seeking authorization from EPA to begin enforcing that regulation. The regulation requires that railroads operating in California must quickly begin adopting zero emission technology for locomotives, technology that is currently not commercially available. The EPA authorizes--if the EPA authorizes California's regulation, supply chains across the country would be in danger due to the operational and financial restraints placed on the railroads. For that reason, numerous groups representing manufacturers, businesses, farmers, ranchers weighed in with EPA, expressing significant concerns. One of the reasons why I bring this up is 65 percent of the national locomotive fleet touches California. We're obviously 40 million people. We have major ports all along the coast, move in products. I think 167 million tons of freight that were moved by rail in California in 2021, employs thousands of people. It's huge for our economy. Where do you stand on this, and how do you plan to move forward on this? Hopefully, some common sense will prevail here. Secretary Buttigieg. So when it comes to railroad regulation, our authorities mostly relate to the physical safety and safe operation of locomotives and railroads, and are in that sense neutral to forms of propulsion or air pollution issues that might be the jurisdiction of the EPA. I would have to refer you to the EPA for anything more on their rule. I'm not as familiar with it. Again, given that our authorities typically have more to do with physical safety. Mr. Valadao. I understand the EPA that's going to have this position. But you're the one that's going to be left holding the bag when again, it's controlling or having an impact on not just California citizens across the country. If 65 percent of the locomotives in the country are touching California and are being delayed because of having either change engines or completely remove engines off the fleet, it's going to have an impact and you're going to be the one to blame. Because when they think locomotion locomotives, they do not think EPA, they're thinking Secretary of Transportation. Secretary Buttigieg. I mean, our experience in this regard probably is mostly more in the realm of the CAFE rule that I was discussing with Mr. Rutherford. Certainly corporations tend to resist regulations to have cleaner air. Our job is to try to make sure that we strike a reasonable balance between what's feasible and what's going to lead to fewer harms from pollution. And certainly, we're hopeful that our supply chains can become both more efficient and greener at the same time. But again, I say that without professing a tab more knowledge than I do about the pending EPA rule or California rule. Mr. Valadao. So 1.6 billion tons of goods removed nationwide, and the EPA's own numbers, only two percent was from locomotives of all the greenhouse gas emissions. So we're talking about a very small amount. I mean, you can move a huge amount of goods with very little bit of very little fuel, but they play such a vital role over the last few years. And I know your office was really helpful on this but we struggled a lot with moving goods. We had cattle all across California, were running out of feed mills because we moved in so many goods from Canada and from the Midwest to feed animals. But there was even a point in time where we were on the verge of running out of cement at our concrete plants to stock construction in our major areas. These are things that have a huge impact on housing prices, food, every other item that is on a storefront. And when you look at greenhouse gas emissions, locomotives are such a small part of it. But when you look at the overall part of what they play in moving goods across the country, this is a huge issue for us, and we have to take this with--we really do have to pay some attention to it and shifting just a little bit. You were in Vegas the other day for the high speed rail. One comment that you made that stood out to me because high speed rail in California, they broke ground in 2015, was that this was going to be the first true high speed rail. What do you mean by that? And why is California, 10 years into this project, construction already started? Why is Las Vegas is going to be done before ours? Secretary Buttigieg. Well, the Las Vegas to Rancho Cucamonga project follows a unique right of way, the bulk of which is actually basically shooting down the middle of the median of I-15. It's part of how they were able to establish the project timelines that they were. So my remark, I should to be very specific, it is not the first true high speed rail to break ground. What I mean by that is, it will we project be the first high speed rail to be in service in terms of revenue rides. Their goal is to be in operation by 2028. They've got an eye on the Olympics, and so we're excited that that would be happening sooner. The north-south project, which we also believe in, are investing in but recognize has a much more complex right of way picture, is on a longer timeline than the Brightline West project. Mr. Valadao. All right, thank you, and I yield back. Mr. Womack. Now let's have a real Pete to Pete conversation. Mr. Aguilar. Mr. Aguilar. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Look forward to your leadership and your tenure in this committee. I've indicated to you privately I want you to be successful. Whether that means you want me to be for you or against you, I will do whatever is best for you. Secretary Buttigieg, good to see you again. As former mayor Torres mentioned, it was good to be in your company at that Brightline event. And I want to thank Mr. Valadao for the segue in this question that I have. The California delegation is incredibly excited to play a role in bringing the Olympic and Paralympic Games to Southern California in 2028. The ELA Olympic Organizing Committee is already fully engaged in the planning process. Historically, the Federal Government has provided significant resources to support and ensure the safety and success of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Just thinking ahead about the department and their preparations for L.A. 2028 Olympic transportation needs, how are you thinking through that? Realizing that this is always difficult? These are not annual things, but clearly this is a significant event. It was equal to seven Super Bowls over a short period of time and the significant challenges that we have. How are you guiding the department and thinking about the L.A. 2028 Olympics? Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you for the question, and as you note, the Olympic Games are just a massive undertaking that requires a lot of forward thinking about how to move people around efficiently and safely. DOT, in particular our Federal Transit Administration, have been working with the Olympic organizing committee, L.A. 2028, since early 2023. Just had a conversation the other day, most recently with that committee myself, and I should note there's an intergovernmental working group that's been set up by the White House to try to make sure that transportation security and other needs faced by the organizers are well coordinated on the federal side. We've had DOT staff tour the expected venues, housing and transportation projects recently, and are committed to working with the L.A. region to make these the best Olympic and Paralympic Games in American history. A couple things of note. They have declared their intention to expand transit in the region to meet the needs for these games. So they are establishing a games bus route network to provide the ability to reach relevant destinations and hubs. There is also the supplemental bus system or SBS concept. We will continue to work with L.A. to address the challenges that come with that--basically mobilizing vehicles borrowed from other jurisdictions, trying to help make sure they can navigate funding, availability of vehicles, drivers and mechanics, and just the logistics of borrowing buses from other transit operators in other jurisdictions. I would also note there are plans to establish mobility hubs that will create inclusivity for all of the suburbs and the outlying communities that are going to play a very important role in the games. And we are pleased to see that the GM of L.A. Metro has been working hard to try to turn L.A.'s resources to work for what we think could be a chance to really showcase what 21st century transportation can look like under the kind of pressure that the foot traffic associated with the games can cause. Mr. Aguilar. And we want that to be successful. What resources do you anticipate needing from this committee in order to make that happen? Specifically, the bus program, that you mentioned, it has been discussed about resources. Secretary Buttigieg. That certainly is one where funding could play an important role. We would be happy to work with this committee and work with the organizers, depending on what funding Congress could make available, just because we are talking about a lot of vehicles and a lot of pieces that have to come into place. We are also working to just make sure we have the technical expertise and assistance in place and think that that working group and that regular cadence of contact is going to serve us well. Mr. Aguilar. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. As Representative Torres mentioned, and again, Mr. Valadao alluded to, we were at that Brightline event. I appreciate in your testimony, and I also wanted to highlight that you discussed the project creating 35,000 jobs, lowering our carbon footprint, and bringing communities closer together. As the DOT distributes funds from the Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, how do we ensure that communities and transportation agencies at the state level are working together for that shared goal of lowering emissions while connecting communities? Secretary Buttigieg. Well, we certainly find that every state has a different strategy for addressing air pollution and carbon emissions. So we are trying to meet them where they are and, at the same time, ensure that every statutory high bar is met. Often, we find there are projects that the states have been wanting to do for a long time, but until the IIJA just didn't have the resources for. And so, whether we are talking about longstanding programs like the Congestion Mitigation Air Quality Program, or things like the PROTECT grants on resilience that didn't exist before the BIL, we are mobilizing every tool that we can, and also, I would mention, in addition to our state partners, sometimes directly engaging cities, transit agencies, airport authorities, especially if we find that they have maybe a higher level of climate ambition than their respective state capitals, and we want to make sure we are supporting them too. Mr. Aguilar. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Womack. Thank you, Pete. Mr. Cline. Mr. Cline. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here. I want to ask a couple of questions about the sixth district of Virginia and the way that various national events are impacting transportation in the sixth. We all are concerned about the bridge collapse, the tragedy involving the six deaths and the billions of dollars in damage, effectively closing the Port of Baltimore, affecting $100 to $200 million in cargo every day. Understand that this could have some impact on rail traffic in Western Virginia. Union officials say some coal trains are being rerouted through Roanoke to coal piers in Norfolk. Could require Norfolk Southern to double the amount of export coal loaded each month at the Lambert Point Terminal. With coal, Baltimore is the number two port, but Norfolk is the number one port. And it is my understanding that CSX and Norfolk Southern are the two main coal carriers in the region. Can you tell us how you have been working with the railroads in the Port of Norfolk to ensure not only that Norfolk plays an integral role there in accommodating a lot of the traffic from Baltimore and that there is a seamless transition there, but how we can ensure that rail is able to accommodate without delays, in particular to passenger rail, that has grown quite a bit in that area as well? Secretary Buttigieg. Thanks, and yes, this is not only a shipping picture, but really has impacted rail, trucking, every form of freight transportation. The week of the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse, I convened supply chain stakeholders from across the spectrum, as well as across the region and the country--not just the ports, but for this very reason, we had rail, trucking, and cargo owners and other representatives there. I will say I have been impressed by how various ports, including Virginia ports, have stepped up to absorb some of that temporarily-diverted cargo, and not just what that means in terms of port capacity, but the railroad and also trucking elements of that as well. Just to convey how complex it can be, there are actually some processes in the automotive finishing process that take place on the grounds of the port of Baltimore that can't easily be moved, such that vehicles that were absorbed in Georgia or in Rhode Island because they couldn't get to Baltimore coming off the ships still had to be trucked to Baltimore in order to be finished and then trucked back out. And obviously, they had to do that without the benefit of having the Key Bridge, which serves so much of that cargo. So at the working level, our multimodal freight office, which was newly created by the IIJA, has been a very important tool that has helped us to have those conversations, that dialogue, and we find that all the different players have stepped up very effectively to absorb what we certainly expect as a temporary but not trivial impact. Mr. Cline. Now when it comes to road transportation, Interstate 81 has been overburdened by truck traffic for decades now. Originally built for around 15 percent truck traffic, it accommodates over 30, 40, sometimes even 50 percent truck traffic, depending on the day of the week, traveling up to the Northeast from points South. And while we are working to add a third lane and would appreciate your cooperation with that, traffic fatalities are up on 81. NHTSA estimated that nearly 41 thousand died in traffic crashes Nationwide in 2023. What are NHTSA's plans to reduce fatalities impacted by crashes? Is widening one of those ways that you all are seeking to reduce crashes? And can you speak to the department's support for adding that third lane to 81? Secretary Buttigieg. Thanks. NHTSA is very focused on reversing the rise in roadway deaths that we have experienced in recent years. The data is suggesting we have finally come off the peak, but I am certainly not satisfied with the current level of roadway death in this country--about 40 thousand people, which means roughly the equivalent of a fully loaded airliner every single day, and a number that I should also add is significantly higher than our peer developed countries. Our strategy for addressing that has five elements: safer roads, safer vehicles, safer speeds, safer people, including drivers, and then a higher standard of post-crash care. Mr. Cline. And that first thing that you mentioned, safer roads. Wouldn't adding additional lanes mileage be part of that? Secretary Buttigieg. Potentially, yes. It certainly depends on the project and the specifics, but we want to make sure that there is a healthy and safe flow of traffic on any interstate. Mr. Cline. Let me ask one more question, before my time expires, that impacts the Roanoke airport because we do have flights that go through Reagan National. The FAA recently issued an analysis of adding more daily round trip flights to Reagan National. It found that 5 more round trips would result in an extra 12 hours of delays each day. It is already the 10th most delayed airport in the country. It would have a negative impact on safety at the airport. Just a few weeks ago, there was a near collision between two commercial flights on a runway with 819 daily take-offs, more than LAX, Newark or O'Hare, it is clear that Reagan National's Runway is the busiest in the Nation. It already ranks third for runway incursions. Can you comment on the administration's position on adding those extra 5 slots? Secretary Buttigieg. Yes. We certainly recognize and respect the role of Congress in determining the availability of slots. I would note, having spent time up in that tower at DCA, that it really is an exceptionally, as you noticed, not only an exceptionally busy airstrip in terms of that one runway, the hardest working runway in the National airspace. We would be concerned about the pressure that that could put on the system. Of course, we stand ready to make good on whatever Congress provides. Mr. Cline. Thank you. Yield back. Mr. Womack. Mr. Espaillat. Mr. Espaillat. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary, thank you. First, I want to thank you for your recent compensation program for flights delay and cancel and the dashboard page that you have available for consumers. I think it is important that we help consumers as delays and cancellations continue to occur, but thank you for that. And I also, obviously, want to thank you, express my sincerity for including $496 million in the proposed funding for Second Avenue subway. And thank you for coming to Harlem. That is an important project that will obviously connect Harlem to the rest of the world. And I also want to stress to my colleagues in the committee that this also provides a social equity component that I think is so important to the communities that we represent, those that have been left behind for far too long, and that need for these projects, not just to be a transportation project for a transportation desert, but an economic stimulus for the communities that we serve. And I thank you for your vision and the president's vision for this particular model. Given the complex nature of urban subway expansions, what measures are being implemented to ensure that Second Avenue phase--Second Avenue subway Phase II remains on schedule and within budget? Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you for your ongoing support for this effort. And it was an absolute joy and one of the highlights of my time here to be able to celebrate that signature with the people who had been waiting for so long in the case of the Second Avenue subway, and finally seeing that funding. Now all eyes are on delivery, and that means making sure that we maintain a tight cadence of interaction and collaboration with MTA and all the players involved in that. We are doing that through our Federal Transit Administration, but this is also a big enough project that it is being tracked at an agency-wide level, too. We know that hurdles and issues can come up. We stand committed to working through any of those to make sure that this is delivered now that the funding is in place, because the people of those Harlem communities and really that whole part of New York that is served up to 125th Street deserve finally seeing that project through after having waited literally for decades in order to see it become real. Mr. Espaillat. Well, I hope the subway leaves the station fairly soon, Mr. Secretary, but I have another question. As you know, I represent a district that has a significant number of Dominican Americans. And as you know, the Department of State and the governor--the government of the Dominican Republic, are in final talks for a long anticipated modern U.S.-D.R. Open Skies Agreement. The cost of flying back home for many of these families is exorbitant. When they go visit their families back home, sometimes they have to pay $1,500, $2,000. So a family of four is going to have a difficult time going back home. And I want to know, given the evolving dynamics of international air travel, what strategies are in place to ensure the effective implementation of the modernized U.S.-D.R. Open Skies Agreement? Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you. I know how important this is, especially to Dominican communities in the U.S. and to the Dominican Republic, and I have had direct conversations with my counterparts from the Dominican Republic about the importance of this. Our Department and our interagency partners at State and Commerce are all participating in these negotiations. We have been negotiating for some time. We are very encouraged by recent progress, though we are not there quite yet. And the real focus is to make sure that we can get to a good place while maintaining the essential elements of a U.S. Open Skies Agreement and the policies that have helped to define that through us in our relationships with all of the countries where we have an air transport agreement. So we are looking forward to getting to a conclusion on a modernized agreement for what is the largest Caribbean market for U.S. travelers. And Open Skies would certainly further facilitate travel and tourism by promoting competition and, we think, creating more affordable options for travelers. Mr. Espaillat. Thank you. And finally, could you elaborate how the Federal Highway Administration investment will help to advance environmental restoration and cleanup within our Nation's highways? Secretary Buttigieg. Yes, thank you. Often there is a brownfield element to some of the grants that we are pursuing, including Federal Highways. That is one of the things that, pursuant to our statutory authority, can help a project to score well in discretionary programs. And we certainly value chances to work with project sponsors to make sure that cleanups are, where required, part of the benefit of a transportation project for the future. Mr. Espaillat. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Mr. Womack. Thank you, Mr. Ciscomani. Mr. Ciscomani Thank you, Chairman, and I am glad to see you in this committee as well. I know you have been serving for a while, and it was great serving with you on FSGG. So, great to be working with you here as well. Thank you. And thank you, Secretary Buttigieg, for being here today. First, I actually want to thank you--offer you our gratitude in Arizona, for it is great to see the I-10. As you know, a main corridor here for us in our state, both for commerce and for tourism, for safety reasons, all of the above, received desperately needed funding for widening earlier this year. So I want to thank you for that. The grant will go a long way in improving safety, travel, and commerce, like I mentioned. This was long overdue. So I do want to, once again, thank your department for prioritizing this important issue for Arizona. Now, Mr. Secretary, I am sure you are aware that there was recently a major train derailment along the Arizona-New Mexico border in which a train carrying car's capacitor material fell off the tracks, caught a fire, and consequently closed down parts of the I-40, which is an essential route for trade and commerce. Many Arizona and New Mexico residents, as well as the Navajo Nation tribal members, have been evacuated from their homes, and many more are concerned about the health effects that this derailment will have on their neighborhoods moving forward. While I am grateful for the fact that local first responders took immediate and effective action to ensure that no one was injured, train derailment after train derailment should not be the new normal. In America, our transportation safety standards should be the gold standard, but the American people are rightfully beginning to lose faith in that standard when they see incidents like this one in Arizona putting their communities at risk. What specifically--what are you specifically changing within your department to ensure something like this never happens again? Secretary Buttigieg. Well, thank you for the question. I passionately agree that there needs to be more done to secure rail safety and to prevent derailments and other accidents. In regards to this particular incident, that day I was in touch with the leadership of the Navajo Nation, as well as Arizona and New Mexico. Our FRA administrator was on site yesterday and will continue to engage. I-40, that stretch of I-40 is back open, but there continue, of course, to be effects due to that derailment and that fire. Within the Department, we have taken a number of steps, some of which we were working on from day one, others accelerated in the wake of the East Palestine, Ohio, derailment. That has included focused inspection programs, including a focused review of the phase in of robust tank cars that can handle the transportation of hazardous materials, as well as a route assessment for high-hazard flammable trains. Railroad by railroad, we have been conducting safety assessments and acting on the findings of those assessments. And I am pleased to note that just a couple of days ago, we welcomed a new partner to our C3RS, or Confidential Close Call Reporting System, as BNSF agreed to join that pilot following the lead of Norfolk Southern. I will say, though, that the overall rates are an extreme concern. With the exception of Norfolk Southern, we have not seen a dramatic reduction in derailments in the last year with Class I railroads. In fact, for many, if not all of them, the rate has gone up. That is one reason that I take every opportunity to renew my urgent call for Congress to act on the bipartisan Railway Safety Act. We will continue to do everything that we can that doesn't require an act of Congress, but given that it has been more than a year since East Palestine, we strongly believe that it is time for Congress to act because that bipartisan legislation would give us a stronger hand and more tools to try to drive down that accident rate. I don't think most Americans realized that there were derailments on a daily basis in this country until what happened in Ohio. And every community that lives near a railroad, including where I grew up, is asking whether they are safe. Mr. Ciscomani. Well, I agree with you that there is a heightened attention on this, and certainly in Arizona, we are seeing the effects of the rates that you are mentioning. I do want to urge you and your team to prioritize rail safety, which it seems that you have a clear understanding of the rates going up on that, and get boots on the ground as soon as possible to see what the community is dealing with in Arizona as soon as you can. And as a result of this incident, analyze how DOT can do better moving forward, which, by your notes, it seems that that is what you are doing. I would love to work with you on this. And I do have another question about. We were running out of time, and I know votes are called, sir, so we will. It may take more than 30 seconds, so I will wait for the second round if that is okay. Mr. Womack. Ms. Wexton. Ms. Wexton. Thank you, Chairman Womack. Congratulations to you. I have no doubt you will continue Chairman Cole's high standard of leadership for this great subcommittee. As members of the committee may know, last year I was diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy, or PSP. I describe it as Parkinson's on steroids and I don't recommend it. PSP makes it very difficult for me to speak, so I use an assistive app so that I can participate and you can understand me. I want to thank the chair and the ranking member for allowing me to do so today. Secretary Buttigieg, it is great to see you again. I want to take a moment to thank you on behalf of the father and father-to-be in my office for taking parental leave not long after you and Jason adopted your two kids as newborns. Even though you didn't take anything close to the 12 weeks that your staff would, it was still a great example to set. I was also happy to read recently that although you are not the stay at home parent, you give the twins their bath every night. I am intrigued that you composed a bath time song. My husband was a stay at home dad when our kids were young and when they were toddlers, bath time was my special time with them. I am not creative enough to compose my own song, but my bath time selection was ``I like You'' by Ernie and Bert from Sesame Street. And yes, I sang both parts. If you are ever looking for another bath time song, I highly recommend it. I also want to thank you for the recent alternative PNTR-FP that DOT released. We have spoken about this critical vulnerability several times before and I am excited to see things moving forward to address it, thanks to your and the department's leadership. It is an exciting time to be a passenger rail supporter in Virginia. At the end of the last year and in large part thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure law, two major awards were announced through the Federal State Partnership program for the expansion of Long Bridge and for high speed rail service between Richmond and Raleigh. The FRA also awarded two grants to extend the D.C. to Roanoke and track line to Bristol and establish daily Cardinal Line service which travels right through my district in Manassas. Just yesterday it was announced that Amtrak Virginia had its highest ridership ever this past March with over 123 thousand passengers. As you know, Union Station is the second busiest rail station in the country. We are all aware that it has significant infrastructure needs, yet it is getting no direct funding from the infrastructure law. I was glad to see the environmental impact statement and record of decision in March, but that is just one step towards the much needed expansion project. We all want to maximize the investments in Virginia that I mentioned, as well as all the work that is being done in the Northeast Corridor, but we won't be able to if Union Station remains a bottleneck. My question for you is how can DOT, FRA, our regional delegation, and other important partners like Amtrak work together to identify funding solutions for this critical project? Secretary Buttigieg. Well, thanks for the question. First, let me just note my admiration for the courage and spirit that you have shown in confronting your diagnosis and continuing to be an effective leader here in Congress, and for your kind words about my family. With regard to Union Station, we recognize its importance really as not just a regional but a national transportation center. And while we are glad that the President's Budget proposes to reserve a $15 million set-aside for immediate state of good repair projects, as you are well aware, the ultimate needs of Union Station are at another order of magnitude. The completion of the EIS is certainly an important step, and I have been in dialogue with the District of Columbia and other stakeholders about how to best position Union Station for long- term success. That is going to include working to make sure that they are not just on top of addressing some end of life station infrastructure, but really preparing the vision for what the future can look like in ways that would qualify for discretionary funds. And of course, we would welcome opportunities to work with appropriators on any source of funding that could help get that done. There is little question that will require multiple sources, Federal, District, Amtrak, and others. Certainly that is an eligibility for Amtrak with the Amtrak grants, but we know how many different needs they are trying to cover on the Amtrak site side as well, and we will maintain that dialogue to try to make progress there. Thank you. Ms. Wexton. I also want to thank you for your and the administration's steadfast support for our Nation's transit systems and transit workers. Transit workers deserve to be treated with respect and to be free from violence, injury, and harassment in the workplace. I was very glad to see the FDA announce a final rule earlier this month taking major steps to protect transit workers, including giving workers an equal seat at the table with transit agencies in identifying and addressing safety and policy issues. How do you see this rule making things safer for transit workers and writers, and how can this subcommittee support that goal? Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you for the question and for your support of transit workers. We believe this rule is an important step forward in giving transit workers the right kinds of protections and the right kind of voice, participating in the newer structures that have been created by legislation, including committee processes, so that any kind of safety- critical needs are addressed in a way that has to include the voice of transit workers. Operators have been through so much, and we think it is very important to back them and believe it is absolutely possible to back them and hear them while also meeting the needs of management and operating these agencies. And I should note that I was thinking of them and of your longtime advocacy yesterday when the family minivan became unavailable and I found myself on a WMATA bus in the morning and the Metro in the afternoon, getting my kids back and forth from daycare, and that bus was full of people who count on it every single day. Ms. Wexton. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Womack. Thank you. Jennifer, you are a valued member of this subcommittee and I share in the Secretary's remarks about your courage and your willingness to continue to participate. And I for one am thankful for the technology that has been developed that allows you to be that valued and important member of this subcommittee. Thank you, so much. We are going to be called for votes here in 3 or 4 minutes, which means in typical congressional fashion, we probably got a good half hour left if we need it. And Mr. Joyce walks in just in time to--go have a seat and I will call on you here, Mr. Joyce. If anybody at the dais has a burning question that they would like to ask in round two, I am going to be able to yield that. And so, Ms. Watson Coleman, I will recognize you first. Just be as brief as you can so that we can get--oh, I know you are. And you are recognized, please. Ms. Watson Coleman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Buttigieg, you know what I am going to ask about. I am going to ask about Mercer Airport. For 3 years we have been trying to get that infrastructure built. We were told most recently that we asked for too much for this size airport. A: I needed to know, is there sort of a metrics where size equals the maximum amount you can be awarded? That is No. 1. Number 2 is, can I have a conversation with someone who will kind of guide me as to how to direct this airport to ask for the right amount to get this infrastructure? You know how much we need it. We deal with 40,000 people a year now, and looking to double that. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Was that quick enough? Mr. Womack. Thank you, that was quite quick. Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you. I will try to likewise be concise. There is, of course, no way that I could miss out on the importance of Mercer Airport after you hosted us for a visit there, and I saw both the importance of it to passengers there and the needs. With regard to successfully receiving a discretionary grant, it is often the case that a project might be rescoped in dialogue with the partner to try to get the size to something that is enough to get something done, but also fits within the program, given all of the different grants that are needed. Without knowing all of the details of the most recent application, you certainly have my commitment to make sure that there is a good debrief, which we would welcome your office participating in as well, to try to get them the best possible information about how to put their best foot forward for any upcoming rounds of discretionary grants. Ms. Watson Coleman. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Womack. Thank you. Mr. Joyce is ready. The gentleman is recognized. Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Chairman Womack, and I apologize for being late. I was at a Defense hearing, and certainly apologize to you, sir. Secretary Buttigieg. No problem. Mr. Joyce. Mr. Secretary, in fiscal year 2019, the Department of Transportation launched the Port Infrastructure Development program. Since then, the department has distributed more than $2 billion to port authorities, tribal, state and local governments, and private companies. While 72 percent of those funds have gone to the west and east coast, only 8 percent of those funds have gone to the Great Lakes ports over the last 5 years. I am concerned that these funds are not being distributed in a regionally equitable manner. Given the concerning disparity, what should we in the Great Lakes region be telling our local communities? Secretary Buttigieg. Well, as you know, representative, I am myself a creature of the Great Lakes. I grew up in Indiana, live in Michigan, met my spouse in Chicago soon after he would returned from Milwaukee, and I know how important those facilities are. I will say that while the dollar amounts can vary on our grants, especially when you consider the different-sized ports that we support, the Great Lakes ports characteristically have been punching above their weight, not just in the value they add to the American economy, but also in the last couple of rounds of the PIDP program. Now that, of course, doesn't mean that every application was successful, but what I will say is that we recognize that America's supply chains and the importance of our ports isn't just about the well-publicized matter of the large container ships that are bearing down, often on ports like L.A. and Long Beach, but the traffic that goes on, often bulk traffic that traverses the Great Lakes, and that we also, of course, support through our management of the U.S. side of the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway, which links those to the Atlantic. And we are certainly happy to provide debriefs to any port that was hopeful of a grant recently, is going to try to come back for another round, again noting that these ports have really demonstrated their often small but mighty character, both in our programs and just in their contributions to U.S. shipping. Mr. Joyce. Can you describe any actions your department has taken to ensure and improve the equitable distribution of Federal Grant Assistance under the program? Secretary Buttigieg. Well, one thing I did was I sat with the representatives of the Great Lakes ports, make sure that my staff and I had an opportunity to hear about the pride they rightfully take and the value they add, and to share some thoughts on how our programs are structured and how to make sure that they do well and continue to grow their share. At a project-by-project or port-by-port level, I also would be happy to engage. And would note that our GLS administrator is himself a veteran of the Great Lakes ports world, and we just see a ton of opportunity there. Mr. Joyce. Thank you, I appreciate it. And I apologize again for being late, sir. Mr. Womack. Mr. Ciscomani. Mr. Ciscomani. Great, thank you chair for this second opportunity. Mr. Secretary, my question is around rest stops and rest areas. As you know, Arizona is one of the fastest growing States in the country and as such, it has pressing needs in transportation. Now, Arizona DOT needs more financial resources and it is looking at creative ways to bring in additional revenue. And also, you may know, that many states in the Northeast, especially along the I-95 corridor, have commercialized rest areas. They add convenience, safety, and more importantly, a revenue stream for States to utilize them. However, because of a 1956 Federal regulation, some Western states, like Arizona, can't commercialize their rest areas. While some states produce revenue because of these rest areas, Arizona is burdened with the cost of these areas. I kind of see this as a double standard, to be honest with you. That is what it strikes me as. So all I am looking for is can you commit to working with me to address the disparity through the appropriations process or the Surface Transportation Reauthorization? Secretary Buttigieg. Yes. As you know, this relates to federal law that prohibits that kind of commercialization. Knowing that there is a great interest in provisions that would either open up additional exceptions or change that provision, we would welcome any request to provide technical assistance and work with you and your office on that. Mr. Ciscomani. Excellent. We will follow up offline here as well so we can work on something. This is something that Arizona has been working on for a long time. We have worked with different secretaries on this and different congresses. We haven't been able to get the result that we need on this. So I am looking forward to working with you on that and hopefully get it done. Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you. Mr. Ciscomani. Thank you, sir. Thank you, chairman. Mr. Womack. All right, thank you, Mr. Joyce. Mr. Joyce. Given the opportunity for a second round, thank you very much. And Mr. Secretary---- Mr. Womack. It pays to come late. Mr. Joyce. Discretionary grants are becoming more and more difficult for smaller communities to apply for because the amount of work needed to complete a given application. From completing the benefit cost analysis to having to review 60 pages for notices of funding opportunities, small businesses are effectively being disqualified from receiving funds for vital community projects because of this burdensome process. Mr. Secretary, what is the department doing to make these programs more accessible to small and rural communities? And once these funds are awarded, what is the department doing to streamline the process so that they can be completed in a timely manner? Secretary Buttigieg. Thanks for the question. I approach this as many other things with the mentality of a mayor who once found myself knocking on the door of the USDOT and a mayor of not the biggest city. I also think back to our time as a mayor when I found out that our paperwork for tax abatements was 17 pages and that we had a chance to get it down to two double-sized sheets, and I try to take the same approach in getting our federal paperwork under control. Believe it or not, when I began pressing our team to find ways to get our notices of funding opportunity under 100 pages, that was actually considered a reduction from past practice. Of course, part of what contributes to the complexity of it is just the nature and the number of statutory requirements that are built into each program. But it is certainly our intention to make sure that these are more user-friendly processes, especially so that smaller, rural, tribal, and lower-income communities, which are some of the ones we most want and need to help, find it just as easy to navigate and succeed as the biggest cities that have a full-time staff of federal relations personnel, like here in D.C. Some of the measures we have taken to do that include not just trying to simplify or consolidate our application processes. For example, we took rural, Mega, and INFRA programs and rolled them up into a single notice of funding opportunity--kind of the same way when you have the application for college, there is a common application so you don't have to fill in your ZIP Code seven different times--but also working hand in hand with those communities on the front end. And I would like to take this opportunity just to again mention our belief in the Thriving Communities Program--far from the biggest dollar item that we will be asking this committee for, but one that has enabled us already to enlist dozens of communities in a program where we pair them up with capacity building partners with a view toward making them better able to compete and win. The last thing I will mention is that it is not just the matter of applying for a grant and getting to yes, but then once you get the grant, there is the whole matter of actually getting through implementation. And the smaller or lower income of community, the more challenges they often face in even just getting from the award announcement to the grant agreement, a process that, it is not unusual for just that part to take a year, and we are trying to fight that down to a tighter timeline. There, I think hands on assistance helps, but we are also always interested in ways to simplify it, all the way down to just creating templates or finding ways to use online tools where there had been paper, pre-selected dropdown menus, anything that can just take some of the complexity out of it. And if you are hearing specific examples or pain points from communities you serve, we'd be interested in hearing that too, so that we can make these processes, again, more user friendly. Mr. Joyce. Thank you. And you will appreciate the fact that I sort of tailored my questions to your background, being a Great Lakes kid and a former mayor. And I also want you to know that if there is something that is in the statutory process that is creating these types of issues for you, this is a two- way street. You tell us where you think we can help simplify those, and we will do the necessary work here to make sure that we make it easier for these communities to get those. Because I think you hit the point, the smaller communities, the ones that need the grant the most, and they have the hardest time of doing that, or they are hiring somebody from the outside to be their grant person, and the money is not going to where it is needed, the people itself. So thank you for your time. Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you. Mr. Womack. Thank you, Dave. Mr. Quigley. Mr. Quigley. Thanks, chair. I hope the public has enjoyed mayor's day here on the hill. Mr. Secretary, thank you for being here. Appreciate your good work. And Mr. Chairman, great initial hearing. Very important. We all know we have critical work to do in a pivotal year on all this, I think we have the right team in place. Very important hearing and well done. Thank you all. Mr. Womack. Thank you, Mike. Before we go, Mr. Secretary, one final question for me as we wrap up. Federal Transit Administration's Capital Investment Grant program is heading into an era where the size of the grants committed for transit projects are the largest in history. Inflation has had a big impact on it, but the amount of demand on the--on the Capital Investment Grant program pipeline looks astronomical over the next decade. Now, based on projects selected for fiscal year 2025 in the annual report, FDA is slating over $20 billion in commitments via grant agreements, many of which are expecting hundreds of millions in payments each year from the THUD bill. IIJA provides $1.6 billion in advance appropriations, but the well runs dry in 2026. So quickly, what is your response to the concern that this $20 billion projected level of commitment over the next decade might create a check that we can't cash? Secretary Buttigieg. In brief, we are working to make sure that we support as many worthy transit projects as we can with the funding that we have. As you note, there is a long list of projects that have met the statutory criteria to get a full funding grant agreement or to go into engineering. The 2025 budget request, $2.4 billion combined with that $1.6 that came through the infrastructure law, that gets us to about $4 billion to meet those current and future needs. Just in terms of how that breaks out, that is about $1 billion for four existing New Starts, $2.1 billion for six New Starts projects not yet under construction grants, and then funding for New Starts projects that might become ready for construction funding in 2025, core capacity projects that might be ready in 2025, and then $533 million for four projects that come under our Small Starts project. We do have enough currently to meet these commitments, but the impacts of budget cuts could force us to make payments over a longer period of time, which, as you note, can increase the time-related costs to projects. Not to go one more time into former mayor mode, but we all know that the longer a project takes, the more it costs if you have been in the business of delivering it. If FTA is to run up against the funding cap during the later years of an authorization, what that would mean is that FTA would have to delay signing any new full funding grant agreements until a new authorization was signed and provided additional funding authority. And it is fair to say that each passing year, those projects would become more expensive if we can't get to them yet because the funding hasn't been available. Mr. Womack. Thank you. We are not going to require a second round. We have had a sampling of it here today. We are going to release the Secretary to a cheeseburger or whatever he has on the menu---- Secretary Buttigieg. Sounds pretty good, Chairman. Mr. Womack . For lunch today. The rest of us are going to go vote. I want to thank publicly, our team. Doug, your team. Avery, Kate, Jared, Naomi.--oh, Diem-Linh. How could I miss you? Christina, thank you. We don't want to overlook you, but we just appreciate the outstanding work of our team that has Womack proofed this hearing today. So thank you so much. And Mr. Secretary, as always, we are just delighted to have you here, and thank you so much. For members that have follow up questions that want to submit them for the record, you have got 7 days. Get them to subcommittee staff, and we will make them a formal part of our record. In closing, again, thanks to all for coming this morning. Look forward to working with you as we continue down the path of the fiscal year 2025 appropriations season. With that, this hearing stands adjourned.

FISCAL YEAR 2025 REQUEST FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT WITNESS ADRIANNE TODMAN, ACTING SECRETARY, DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Mr. Womack. The subcommittee will come to order. Welcome to our second hearing of the fiscal year 2025 appropriations season. Today I would like to welcome the Acting Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Honorable Adrianne Todman, to this hearing on HUD's fiscal year 2025 budget request. Thank you, Madam Secretary, for appearing here today. Delighted to hear from you. We look forward to hearing from you today about HUD's request for the fiscal year 2025 fiscal year and kicking off the current appropriations process. It is the fundamental job of this subcommittee to complete our work on time before the end of the fiscal year. I am confident that we can fulfill our task. I hope our colleagues who do not serve on this committee will be cooperative and help us meet this goal. Our job as appropriators is to carry out our Nation's most fundamental duty of funding the government. This hearing is just the start of what we are called to do to make this government work for the American people. Today we will hear testimony about the Department of Housing and Urban Development's budget request for $66 billion in discretionary budget authority in fiscal 2025. HUD also uses mortgage guarantee fees from the Federal Housing Administration to offset its spending. The Office of Management and Budget currently estimates $6.7 billion in offsetting receipts for fiscal 2025, an increase of 1.2 billion from the fiscal year 2024 receipts score. We must recognize the impact that the health of the housing market and FHA receipts have on this bill every year. In addition to discretionary funds, HUD also proposes over $81 billion in mandatory programs over 10 years. We are certain to face fiscal constraints in putting together our bill. This forces us to get back to the blocking and tackling of appropriations to make sure every dollar is well spent and purposeful. It lets us focus on funding the real needs of the government in a way that is sustainable, justifiable, and works for the long-term fiscal health of our great Nation. HUD's programs impact every district, from providing rental vouchers to families to helping first-time home buyers get a mortgage to housing veterans who have served our country admirably. HUD programs allow elderly Americans to live with dignity in housing that meets their needs and keep people safe from hazards in their homes. Deciding how to best allocate funding to these important programs is our task and the task of our subcommittee. One of my priorities on this subcommittee is to stop the runaway housing inflation that impacts not only my constituents in Arkansas but every American. We cannot turn a blind eye to families impacted by the rising housing costs in part caused by choices made by this administration. I also want to focus today on out-of-control regulations that set up unnecessary bureaucratic barriers. Overregulation limits opportunities, and it feeds inflation often without making meaningful improvements in people's lives. I look forward to learning about HUD's successes and your long-term goals in this hearing. This subcommittee stands ready to work with you to better serve all Americans as we right the T-HUD fiscal 2025 appropriations bill. With that, I recognize my colleague and our ranking member and my good friend, the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Quigley for his opening comments. Mr. Quigley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As we said yesterday, for those who don't know it, the chairman and I were chairman/rankers on FSGG. Had a great partnership. And I want to echo his desire on what should be commonplace business here on the Hill of funding the government in a responsible, timely basis. Doing so after the fiscal year begins makes no sense. We need to show the world that we can govern. But I also want to welcome the Acting Secretary, Todman, before this subcommittee. It is great to have you here, both as Acting Secretary of HUD and an experienced affordable housing practitioner. You have led one of the Nation's largest housing authorities and have seen firsthand the challenges of addressing homelessness, preserving public housing and creating housing opportunities for low income families. I look forward to the very valuable and nuanced perspective your experience will bring to our conversation today. As you know, this Nation faces significant challenges with housing affordability and homelessness. According to HUD's 2023 report on worst-case housing needs, over 8.5 million of the lowest income households in the U.S. pay more than half their income for rent, live in severely inadequate conditions, or both. This is an increase of 760,000 households compared to the previous year. The solutions to these challenges are sometimes complex, but this subcommittee has risen to the occasion on a bipartisan basis each year to help HUD meet its mission to create affordable housing opportunities and strong, sustainable communities. In fiscal year 2024, we were able to prevent evictions for nearly five million low income households, invest in programs that help mayors and governors fund locally driven solutions by expanding grants to reduce barriers to affordable housing production, and target 418 million more for homeless assistance grants to help over 750,000 people move out of homelessness and into permanent housing. While we have made important strides to address homelessness among veterans and families with children in particular, the fight to end homelessness is far from over. Data from HUD's most recent national count of people experiencing homelessness on a single night in 2023 showed a striking increase of 12 percent over 2022. This is the single largest 1-year increase since HUD began collecting data in 2007, and it was reflected across subpopulations. While these numbers are sobering, they are not cause for hopelessness. When you talk to local leaders, they know what works. I hope we all feel the urgency of providing the resources and flexibility that localities need to support and house our most vulnerable communities. Without it, the impacts of this housing crisis can be felt beyond our housing systems. Hospitals, schools, and criminal justice systems all bare a huge burden. Secretary, I am pleased that you have brought before us a budget that will continue our progress in addressing these complex challenges. I look forward to working with you and the chairman to come to a fiscal year 2025 agreement that adheres to the Fiscal Responsibility Act requirements without compromising our responsibility to ensure millions of Americans remain stably housed and receive the support they need to build a safe and thriving home. I look forward to your testimony. And I yield back. Mr. Womack. Thank you, Mike. The chairman of the full Appropriations Committee, Mr. Tom Cole, who was the subcommittee chairman this time last year and wrote the 2024 bill, is preoccupied with disasters in his own State. My understanding is that Tom may be returning to Washington this week. We have a scheduled visit tomorrow. So he won't be able to be here, and any prepared remarks that Mr. Cole might have had we will enter into the record. And without objection, so ordered. Mr. Womack. The chair notes that the gentlelady from Connecticut, the ranking member on the full committee has graced us with her presence. And Ms. DeLauro, I am going to recognize you for your opening comments. Ms. DeLauro. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I apologize for being late. I should know better that with the hearings that you would be conducting, that it is spot on. It is happening. It is going to start on time. So I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Ranking Member Quigley for holding the hearing. And I thank you to Acting Secretary Todman. Welcome to the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee. Let me offer my congratulations to you on the position of Acting Secretary of HUD. A big, really big undertaking, you know, especially today because the biggest issue that affects every single community across America is the lack of affordable housing. There is a shortage of nearly 8 million affordable homes available nationwide. Housing costs have skyrocketed, driving up the cost of living for American families, and putting homeownership completely out of reach for many. And this is really--homeownership, having a place to be, to call your own, is the American dream. It is the American dream, and people are suffering without being able to have access to affordable housing. And the lack of affordable housing has contributed to the escalation of the homelessness crisis. I spoke to mayors from across the country yesterday. They shared how rates of homelessness in their communities are spiraling out of control. Some 600,000 people in America, mothers, fathers, grandparents, children experience homelessness on any given day. This is an issue consuming the everyday of our local leaders. What they said to me, actually, was this is the thing that keeps them up at night, of how they are going to try to cope with it. One mayor said he has got like 12 or 1,500 people, you know, every night outside, you know, just sleeping, you know, and without any place to be. So it really is a critical issue. So high rent, low housing inventory are crippling their ability to respond. They need resources, including through increased support for Housing Choice Vouchers and through project-based vouchers, which would allow for additional affordable housing development. There are many factors that contribute to homelessness, in addition to housing affordability, but we, as a Nation, have yet failed to resolve this crisis. Provide for the most basic of human needs for our most vulnerable populations should bring us great shame but, at the same time, great urgency about doing something. The importance of providing more housing in places Americans live and work and ensuring that there are roofs over their heads, of children and families, should be a central focus of this Congress. And, indeed, in the final 2024 funding package, we made investments to improve housing affordability and accessibility. We prevented the eviction of nearly 5 million low income individuals and families, and invested in legal aid assistance for eviction prevention grants. We provided historic increases for tribal housing and community development programs. We invested in programs that help mayors and governors find locally driven housing solutions. And the majors yesterday told me they do have solutions, and they need to get a hearing on those solutions. And we expanded grants for reducing barriers to affordable housing production, and we expanded housing options for people experiencing homelessness by committing new resources to construction and rehabilitating permanent, supportive housing. However, I still--this is an incredible amount of work to be done. Longstanding inequities in housing persist, are exacerbated by the housing inventory shortage and elevated borrowing costs. It was just over 56 years ago that President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of which the Fair Housing Act was included as title 8. Yet, the racial homeownership gap, the difference in homeownership rates between White and Black Americans is essentially unchanged to this day. And I would like to hear more about what the department is doing to address this historic inequity. Looking forward to 2025, the President's budget request for HUD proposes nearly $73 billion. We should support investments that would enable HUD to expand rental assistance for low income households, increase the affordable housing supply, expand homeownership opportunities for underserved borrowers, advance efforts to end homelessness, address housing-related discrimination, increase climate resilience and energy efficiency, and strengthen communities suffering from underinvestment. Bringing down the high cost of living for American families has got to be our primary focus. People struggle every day. They live paycheck to paycheck. Housing is one of the primary drivers of the inflation suffocating families' budgets and holding back our economy. I believe that your department and this subcommittee must assume a leading role in tackling these issues. Thanks so much for being here, for your public service to our country. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Womack. I thank the gentlelady. Secretary Todman, you hit the lottery today. You are appearing before--and I know I am biased--the best subcommittee on the House Appropriations Committee. The gentlemen and ladies that sit to my right and my left are genuinely interested in addressing the issues that fall under our portfolio. HUD, of course, being one of those. So we are anxious to hear your comments today. I think you will find that the Q and A we will do following your remarks will be beneficial not only to you but to this subcommittee as we continue to press against the challenges facing this great Nation of ours. And with that, I will give you 5 minutes for your opening comments. Secretary Todman. Thank you. Chairman Womack, Ranking Member Quigley, and distinguished members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today under the President's fiscal year 2025 budget proposal for HUD. And thank you and your staff for supporting HUD's mission, as reflected in our 2024 budget. I know that you had tough choices to make, and we are looking forward to working with you in the implementation of those funds. HUD has been hard at work getting resources out the door. We have stood up two new programs, ENB and PRICE to modernize how and where we build housing. There were more apartments under construction in 2023 than in any year on record, and we are helping to build even more. We have provided more new rental vouchers to Americans across the country, the largest increase in 20 years. We have helped almost 20 million families buy their first home. Last year alone HUD allocated more than $340 million to help eliminate health hazards, like lead, in American homes. And we continue to prevent and remedy the impacts of discrimination, and we are making investments in HUD's workforce and technology to ensure that we can support communities who need us now more than ever. This past Monday, I also had an opportunity to meet with 40 or so mayors. There were Democrats, Republicans representing big cities, the suburbs, and small towns, who acknowledge the support that they have received from HUD and the Biden-Harris administration. But they also shared what they are hearing from their constituents: The need for more rental assistance, access to homeownership, and helping the homeless, particularly our homeless veterans. I also heard from your colleagues on the Senate side as well about the housing need that exists in their respective States. So we, at HUD, know our work is simply not done. That is why the President's budget proposes bold mandatory investments focused on increasing the Nation's housing supply, helping first-time homeowners by providing $10 billion in first generation downpayment assistance, $15 billion to support additional apartments that low income families can afford and to make repairs to public housing, $33 billion to prevent and address homelessness, particularly for veterans, our seniors, and youth aging out of foster care. Together this suite of funding and other tax proposals aim to tackle housing affordability head on. The budget proposal also requests $72.6 billion for HUD, nearly $363 million more than the '24 enacted. And it is to support our core programs and our housing delivery systems, our public and assisted housing, the HOME program, CDBG, our Housing Choice Vouchers, our Healthy Homes Program, programs to prevent evictions and address homelessness with the urgency it requires. And certainly, initiatives to boost homeownership and other wealth-building opportunities. Our proposal also, once again, calls on Congress to support communities devastated by disasters by authorizing HUD's disaster recovery program. Whether it is hurricanes, tornados, wildfires, or flooding, HUD needs to be better positioned to aid communities much faster than we are right now, and we cannot do that without Congress' help. Senators, creating and sustaining strong communities and providing--Congress people, creating and sustaining strong communities and providing access to affordable housing are priorities for the Biden-Harris administration, and the President has put forward a vision that builds in our existing body of work. And HUD is certainly prepared to do our part. Chairman, ranking member, distinguished members of this subcommittee, thank you again for this opportunity. I will also agree, Chairman, that this is the best and hardest working subcommittee here in the House of Representatives, and I look forward to working with you on behalf of the American people and their credible housing needs. Thank you so much. Mr. Womack. And we thank you. Each member will have 5 minutes. We will adhere to the 5- minute rule. Your light will turn yellow when there is a minute remaining, so heed the warnings as recognized by the lights. Members will be recognized in order of seniority based on who was seated at the beginning of the hearing this morning. I will recognize myself for 5 minutes. Let me kick off this hearing by saying that our thoughts are with our colleagues whose districts were devastated by tornados this past weekend. I am especially thinking about my friend and our full committee chairman, Tom Cole, who this week is viewing the devastation on the ground in hard-hit communities he represents. We send our prayers to the injured and join those who are mourning the lives lost. Acting Secretary Todman, do I have your commitment that HUD will work diligently and quickly with communities on the ground to rebuild as soon as possible? Secretary Todman. You certainly do. Mr. Womack. Thank you. As you well know, the Appropriations Committee appropriates the funding for the CDBG disaster recovery. That is the CDBG-DR program. Can you remind the subcommittee on the DR process and steps HUD has taken to ensure that funds appropriated to communities are quickly disbursed? Secretary Todman. Certainly. Well, as I mentioned in my opening comments, Chairman, we certainly do need Congress' help to not just authorize the program but also to provide us with those disaster recovery funds. I have yet to receive some of the funding that we need to take care of our storms that happened in 2023, and certainly look forward to working with this subcommittee and others to get that across the line. Having said that, one of the things that we did do very recently was reach out to all of the existing disaster recovery grantees, those States and big towns that has received our funding, but also the general public to say how can we do this better? We know that we are not perfect. We know that this is meeting families and communities, at their most traumatic time, receive a lot of information, and we will be putting that to work to make sure we are streamlining the program. Mr. Womack. There are probably people on this dias that are maybe a bit confused as to the difference between CDBG-DR and what would normally happen in a disaster with FEMA, SBA, and others involved. Can you delineate the differences between what the responding agencies on these disasters do and then where the CDBG-DR program fits in? Secretary Todman. Certainly. So FEMA is certainly the Federal Government's first responder. They are usually the first boots on the ground, and they help to stabilize communities just in the immediate and short-term. And SBA also helps by providing businesses and homeowners with resources they need quickly to try to get back on their feet. What HUD does, and I say this across the country, is HUD is there when the headlines are gone. You know, sadly, we have so many disasters and so frequently that we forget sometimes some of the Americans who are impacted. HUD's work is to be there to rebuild and reknit the communities in the long-term. I have been to Florida after Ian. I have been to Kentucky after the tornados that happened there, met with the local leaders and people. So HUD is there to help rebuild homes in the long-term and to build resiliency into anything our funds touch so that we can try to prepare for what inevitably may be the next disaster. Mr. Womack. I am not going to ask you to wade into the issues regarding the permanent authorization of CDBG-DR. That is a fight that Congress will need to take up if, in fact, it is going to happen. We appreciate your response on the disaster recovery piece. My last question in this round is one of my priorities is making sure that HUD-VA Supportive Housing program, HUD-VASH, is working well and veterans can access and use the HUD-VASH rental assistance vouchers quickly. Out of the 110,000 vouchers awarded in the HUD-VASH program, why are nearly 30,000 vouchers still waiting to be leashed up, according to HUD's latest dashboard? Secretary Todman. You know, we do find that sometimes we have been--it has been difficult for veterans to sometimes use these vouchers in the private rental market, and so we have been working very carefully with housing agencies on ways that we can improve the program and also improve some of the business aspects of our relationship with private---- Mr. Womack. Any early indications what those changes, what those modifications might be? Secretary Todman. We are certainly looking at issues around inspections. We are looking at issues around getting eligibility documents done quickly. But one of the other things that we are doing is working with our partners at Veterans Affairs to make sure that we are receiving referrals or the agencies are receiving referrals very quickly, and both agencies are working very closely with each other on the ground to make sure veterans are housed. Secretary McDonough and I just probably 3 weeks ago kicked off a VA and HUD bootcamp to help housers and the VA Medical Center leaders figure out how to work more seamlessly with each other. Mr. Womack. Thank you. Mr. Quigley. Mr. Quigley. Thank you, Chairman. Madam Secretary, I want to dovetail on the chairman's questions with CDBG-DR. I think, to put it in a broader perspective, our thoughts are with the full committee chairman and the sites he is visiting and the people who have suffered, but we recognize that the number and severity of storms and fires and other natural disasters have increased. And we have to be honest with ourself and recognize that we can't just build the same old infrastructure back. We have to build it with resilience and recognize what the long-term needs are. But it has been nearly, what, a year and a half since Congress has helped communities with long-term disaster funding through CDBG-DR. So I guess the first question is: What do you see as the current unmet need at this point? And what is probably going to be our annual need as we go forward so we can appropriately plan and budget? Secretary Todman. So I know that we have sent over to the Congress sort of our DR funds need for the 2023 storms, and I believe that is like $3.2 billion. $3.2 billion is the existing need. Mr. Quigley. Can you pull your microphone a little closer? Secretary Todman. Certainly. I will get a little closer. $3.2 billion is our existing need based on the storms that occurred in 2023. That doesn't include any storms that have occurred so far this year and probably at the tail end of last year. Mr. Quigley. Please keep us informed on that. And I appreciate that you referenced homelessness in your opening. You have watched us for some time and currently have a good perch to see how we are doing as it relates to this, but in the communities that seem to be succeeding at, at least, reducing homelessness or it is not an increase, and, particularly, unsheltered homelessness, what seems to be working? What programs and ideas? Secretary Todman. What I see works is a high level of outcome-based coordination between the housing system, the homeless system, and really the political leadership in towns and counties across the country. And when that seamlessness occurs, when everybody agrees on what their true north is, I think that we do see a fair amount of work occurring. But notwithstanding that intentionality, folks need resources. People continue to tell me the need for more vouchers, the need for more funds that we are giving to our continuums of care. So we know the need is great, as evidenced in our point-in- time count report from last December, but with resources and intentionality, we think that that is the way to help Americans. Mr. Quigley. You talk about coordination seemingly local, but how is HUD? And are they coordinating with other Federal agencies to provide supportive services to maximize our investments and improve homeless intervention outcomes? Secretary Todman. So we actually kicked off a new pilot with our partners over at HHS to do just that, to match our housing and their services. We call it a housing and services accelerator. And Secretary Becerra and I kicked that off, I want to say, just about a month ago. It is a pilot that has targeted eight States that have their Medicaid waivers, and the idea is to use some of HHS' funding for not just services that are happening at sites and elsewhere but also for some of those very modest upfront costs that our most vulnerable families have, whether it is, you know, helping to clean up an apartment before they get in there or something tied to their rental fee. So we are trying to marry our programs and HHS' services dollars to try to make sure we are helping families who are the most vulnerable. Mr. Quigley. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Womack. As a matter of personal privilege, I am going to recognize Mr. Joyce who has important matters before the United States Supreme Court from his position as chairman of the Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee. And I will recognize Mr. Joyce for 5 minutes so that he can depart early and---- Mr. Quigley. I object. Mr. Womack . Go set the--so he can go set the SCOTUS straight. Okay? Mr. Joyce. Mr. Joyce. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I am going to do as best I can to follow in your footsteps and lead this committee. Acting Secretary, welcome. Secretary Todman. Thank you. Mr. Joyce. I know you have big shoes to fill. My big dear friend Marcia Fudge was there before you, and in honor of her, I am going to ask you a question that she--about an issue that she brought really to my attention and that is the use of lead- based paint. It was banned in 1978, but its harmful legacy has continued in Ohio, especially in the Cleveland area where she represented so ably over the years. Across the United States it is also an issue, but 65 percent of Ohio housing was built prior to 1978, and, therefore, lead paint is a bigger issue. Even at very low levels, lead exposure damages a child's brain and nervous system, potentially resulting in slow growth and development, learning and behavioral problems, and hearing and speech issues. While it is critical to reduce the exposure to these, existing programs that you have, have addressed lead in homes to, obviously, try to prevent some of this. Given the urgency to rid homes of hazards such as lead, what should we be telling our local communities about resources that they can access through the Department to reduce child exposure to toxic metals and eliminate these hazards in their homes? Secretary Todman. Thank you, Congressman. And yes, removal of lead hazards was something really important to Secretary Fudge, and I share that in her values. You are absolutely right. We need to do everything we can to remove these hazards from homes, particularly given what they do to impact our babies. And we are very fortunate to have a robust program that helps not just housing agencies but mayors and county executives and nonprofits do that work. I will say that I do think we can probably do a better job making sure that folks are aware of these resources and teach them how to access it. And that is going to be something that I take on while I am in this seat and look forward to working with you on some of those ideas. Mr. Joyce. I am sure we all look forward to working with you to help advocate for that in our communities and to our constituents. Can you talk about the innovative public/private funds that offer new and more flexible gap financing that could increase the pace at which these local communities can eliminate the public health threat and compliment existing efforts? Secretary Todman. No, absolutely. So, you know, almost everything that HUD does requires the public and private sector working with each other. We know that our health hazard funds are sometimes matched with funds that are with, you know, nonprofits and other private sector partners on the ground. We know that we need to do more of that. We know that we have businesses who are very interested in making sure that we are moving lead hazards in and around their communities as well. And so I think that there is more work to do there. Mr. Joyce. What aspects of your fiscal year 2025 request will help improve the rate at which the Department can assist communities in eliminating these home-based hazards. Secretary Todman. Well, certainly, you know, the budget reflects some of the constraints placed by the Fiscal Responsibility Act, and so we are trying to be responsible stewards and follow that law. But certainly, we prioritize this, and we do have a robust number in there to carry out the work of our health hazards program. It is lead. It is mold. It is radon. It is all the things that we know are hurting our families. And we certainly look forward to working with the subcommittee on what our final number looks like. Mr. Joyce. Thank you very much. Keep up the great work. Secretary Todman. Thank you. Mr. Joyce. And thank you for your time, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Mr. Womack. Thank you, Mr. Joyce. And now I am going to recognize one of my Democrat friends, and you guys may want to arm wrestle over it. Mrs. Torres, do you need to---- Mrs. Torres. I have until about 11:00. I have got 30 minutes. Mr. Womack. You have 30 minutes? Mrs. Torres. Yes. Mr. Womack. Ms. Watson Coleman, do you want to---- Mrs. Watson Coleman. Am I one of your Democratic friends? Mr. Womack. I hope so. Mrs. Watson Coleman. I just want to make sure as I embark on this. Mr. Womack. We will find out when we get to full committee markup, yes. Ms. Watson Coleman, you are recognized. Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And congratulations to you, Madam Acting Secretary. Secretary Todman. Thank you. Mrs. Watson Coleman. You have very big shoes to fill, but I have looked at your bio, and you can certainly fill them---- Secretary Todman. Thank you, ma'am. Mrs. Watson Coleman . Because of the work that you have done. I want to talk to you a little bit about the current litigation before the Supreme Court debating on whether or not homelessness and potentially setting a precedent that would criminalize homelessness, which is unheard of in my mind. No one wants to be homeless if they have an option. How will HUD use funds proposed in the budget to combat this? Additionally, what can Congress do to promote the use of sound evidence-based approaches to resolving homelessness which don't involve further victimizing people who are experiencing it? Secretary Todman. Well, thank you for that. Well, I will start by saying homelessness is not a crime. And what HUD can do is to prevent and eliminate homelessness altogether. It is one of the reasons why when we looked at what we prioritized, what the President prioritized in this budget, we tried to make sure that that piece of our work receive the amount of funds that we need to meet this moment, notwithstanding the constraints of the Fiscal Responsibility Act. But we also have an obligation to work with our partners on the ground who are on the frontlines carrying out this work, our continuums of care, our housing agencies to make sure that they are working as swiftly as they can as well in providing technical assistance. So we understand the need. We think HUD's role is to make sure people are using our funds in a very intentional way but also doing what we can, working with other Federal HUD partners, to prevent homelessness to begin with. Mrs. Watson Coleman. I want to ask you about the using of your funds because when I look at all the requests and the money that you have at your disposal, it looks like a lot. Now, I don't know if it is enough because we have such a massive issue with homeownership, home rentals, and all kinds of populations and things of that nature. But has HUD found bottlenecks, bottlenecks that interfere or delay the money that you have allocated to certain issues getting kind of caught up in systems? If so, like, where do you find that most prominently? And what is it that you think you can do about it? What is it that you think we need to do about it? Secretary Todman. Thank you for that. So I will say at the onset that we don't have enough resources. The country, not just HUD, doesn't have enough resources. Mrs. Watson Coleman. I believe that. Secretary Todman. One in four eligible people for our vouchers receive a voucher. Just one in four. So that means that there are three of the four families out there who are needing our help, who are either homeless or at risk of being homeless because they are just on the edge. So certainly, we don't have the resources that we need, which is why the President, in each one of our three budgets, has proposed more vouchers. Mrs. Watson Coleman. Okay. With that in mind, I agree with you. Do you find bottlenecks? Secretary Todman. Certainly. Mrs. Watson Coleman. Where are they? Secretary Todman. The bottlenecks in using our vouchers stems in some of the rules that HUD has to follow. You know, landlords will complain about the length of inspections, landlords will complain about making sure that--just working with the government is sometimes slow. So we have created some flexibilities over the past couple years to give housing agencies tools that they can use to work more quickly and to provide incentives to work with landlords. I think that that connection is probably the biggest bottleneck we have in the use of our rental assistance. Mrs. Watson Coleman. So is our biggest problem a lack of housing, the variety of housing that we need? Is our problem investors who buy up housing and create, you know, this more expensive, unaffordable? Is it discrimination? What is it altogether? Secretary Todman. I would have to say if there is one thing, it is that as a country, as a whole, we have not kept up with the demand for housing, whether you are in big cities or small towns, and that is a fact. Since 2008, 2009, we just have not built at the pace that we need, and we need approximately two to three million more housing units. And so if there was one thing I would say, if we did that one thing, I think it would make an impact, it is that because by doing that, not only are we providing units for people to live in, but we are also helping to reduce the overall cost by increasing the supply that can meet the demand that we have. Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you, Madam Secretary. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Womack. Mr. Gonzales. Mr. Gonzales. Thank you, Chairman. And thank you, Acting Secretary, for being here. I have the privilege of representing San Antonio, the seventh largest city in the country, predominantly Hispanic community. I would love to work with you on housing and some other issues. Would you be willing to take a trip to San Antonio? I would love to host you at your convenience. Secretary Todman. Absolutely. Happy to do that. Mr. Gonzales. Fantastic. What you will find is Texas is like a country of its own, and we are used to kind of going about it our own way, but it shouldn't be that way. You know, in many cases, at the local level, housing is very much an issue, but if you talk to the people of San Antonio, it is the local city council and it is the local mayor that are feeling as if they are carrying a larger share of the need and the want. And I think there is an opportunity here. You know, over the last decade, the overall poverty rate in San Antonio has relatively stayed the same at 18 percent. There is over 110,000 families on the public housing waiting list. Another thousand families get added to it each month. So the demand is absolutely there. The city is growing at an incredible rate. Opportunity Home San Antonio, which is the local housing authority in San Antonio, needs well over half a billion dollars to address capital maintenance issues across their properties. I used one of my community projects to help with this, but that is a couple million bucks. It is a drop in the bucket compared to the need. Like many public housing authorities across the country, Opportunity Home must utilize other funding streams to provide affordable housing, including local taxpayer funds. Given the Federal Government's role in providing public housing maintenance, are there any opportunities for additional funding or incentives to cities that use local funds to preserve and create new public housing? Secretary Todman. Thank you for that. I look forward to my trip to San Antonio with you. You know, one of the things that HUD has used over the past several years to help housing agencies with their capital need is the Rental Assistance Demonstration program. We call it RAD. And it has been very successful. And agencies have been able to use that and leverage their assets to be able to raise funds to make repairs. And so we see that happening all over the country, including San Antonio. New kitchens, new bathrooms, things that are really meaningful to residents. Mr. Gonzales. That is fantastic, and I would love to drill down more on this program and others that work. I visited one of the housing facilities on the west side of San Antonio, and you had families drying their clothes outdoors on a clothes hanger, you know, like it was, you know, 100 years ago. And it is just not right in so many cases. And I get that, you know, the demand for cost and you are always struggling for dollars, but I just would love to find a way on how we can deliver so that way these families can live in a very dignified way. And like you said, a new washer and dryer, that is a game changer for many of these families. My next question: We are in a housing crisis in San Antonio. There is just simply not enough houses to go around. Because of this, realty experts have said that newly built homes are imperative to keeping up with the growing demand. With thousands of people relocating to San Antonio, this has been a significant concern to local realtors. What efforts are underway to help increase the overall supply of housing in the Texas area? Secretary Todman. Sure. Over the past couple years, HUD has worked with the other agencies in the Federal Government on an overall housing supply action plan, and while we have proposed dollars that we think are needed to resource that plan, we have also used our existing administrative authorities to do things. One example of that is the Federal Financing Bank Risk Sharing Program that we have with Treasury, which has provided really necessary gap financing for developers through the Housing Finance Agency to kind of get that work done. We were able to extend the deadline and make that initiative permanent, and so we are hoping to have much more housing built with that particular program, which is just using the authorities that HUD and the Treasury Department have. Mr. Gonzales. Excellent. And that is all the questions I have. I look forward to working with you and your team, and I look forward to hosting you in San Antonio. With that, Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Womack. Thank you, Tony. Mrs. Torres. Mrs. Torres. Thank you, Chairman. And I know I am your friend because we serve on two committees together. Welcome to our committee. We are so excited to have you here and weigh in on some of our questions regarding housing affordability. When it comes to transportation and housing, low wage earners are, you know, at the--for me, are at the very, very low end. They are paying the highest in public transportation and the highest--up to 50 percent of their income goes for public transportation So housing is incredibly important. Those vouchers are incredibly important. In fiscal year 2023-24, the funding bill provided funding for nonprofits under HUD EDI program as community projects, invested many of my community projects in affordable housing for low wage workers in my district. Unfortunately, this year nonprofit organizations will no longer qualify for those projects. We have housing availability and options for ag workers, but for warehouse workers that I represent, you know, there is really nothing that has been cut out for them. Organizations like The House of Ruth, which is a domestic violence shelter, the National CORE, which is a national award- winning nonprofit organization, you know, that builds affordable housing will no longer be able to qualify for this funding. Do you have any thoughts and ideas on how you can help them build up the housing stock that communities like mine desperately need? Secretary Todman. In the face of HUD not being able to provide any of the community project funding to---- Mrs. Torres. But specifically to nonprofits. Secretary Todman. To nonprofits. Certainly, nonprofits are qualified subgrantees to our--all of the other funds that we have. Our CDBG funds come to mind. In fact, many nonprofits across the country are deploying our dollars as we speak. There is very limited other opportunities that HUD has to provide nonprofits with direct access to our funds. So it would basically be sort of as a subgrantee. Mrs. Torres. Okay. I would like to work with you on that issue---- Secretary Todman. Sure. Mrs. Torres . On how we can expand some options and opportunities for them to continue to serve our communities. On another issue, veterans across the country are sometimes forced to choose between their disability benefits and housing vouchers, HUD-VASH vouchers. Currently, HUD rules count veterans' Federal disability stipend as income, which, combined with social security, can put them above the qualifying level. Restrictive, you know, income limits imposed on these low income housing tax credits, is another obstacle for them. Do you plan on revisiting the HUD definition of annual income to exclude VASH vouchers specifically to deal with this issue, to address this issue for veterans? Secretary Todman. This issue came to our attention several months ago, and we have been working very closely with our partners at Veterans Affairs to just figure out what was going on and how folks were--what some of the highest needs--members of our veterans with the highest needs not being able to access our housing. And so we have been working closely with Treasury. One of the things that we will be doing is increasing the eligibility limit so that more veterans can access our VASH vouchers. What that means is that by increasing it from 50 percent to 80 percent, we understand we are able to assist 97 percent of all homeless veterans across the country. So we think that is a good start. Mrs. Torres. Okay, but their disability payments will still get in the way. Secretary Todman. Well, that includes--that 80 percent would include their vet's benefits. It would be included in their definition of income. So when we take our bar and raise it to 80, it will take care of 97 percent of the homeless veterans in the country. And working with our partners at Treasury, we are helping them figure out how to work with their programs as well. Mrs. Torres. Great. Well, we will check in with Treasury also, and I look forward to working with you. And I yield back. Mr. Womack. Thank you, Norma. Mr. Valadao. Mr. Valadao. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Madam Secretary, for your time today. I want to make you aware of a unique challenge we are facing in California where we have a conflict between HUD and IRS regulations. Given the State's affordability challenges, we are starting to see more developers leverage HUD programs with the low income housing tax credit to build new affordable housing. However, HUD's methodology for calculating utility allowances is out of date. The IRS in California can calculate utilities building by building while HUD is still using area-wide estimates that don't consider the energy efficiency of new construction. I never thought I would say this, but California is doing something positive and market driven when it comes to affordable housing. And currently, California is forced to use HUD's outdated methodology, and we are overspending on utilities. This is money that could go towards constructing badly needed housing. This seems like a simple fix, and I want to ask you if HUD has any plans to update its methodology to allow States like California to calculate utility allowances and utilize the tax credit more accurately? Secretary Todman. I am just hearing of this for the first time, Congressman, so I will commit to figuring out what is going on. And I look back at my team, who is busy taking notes, and we will get back to you on how we can address that. Mr. Valadao. I appreciate that. It is something that seems pretty reasonable, and I figured you would be open-minded on this one and wanting to work with us. Secretary Todman. I am happy to work with you. Mr. Valadao. In California, we really do struggle with some of our housing issues there across the State and even in our rural communities. Since 2014, the Federal Government has issued nearly $20 billion in awards to communities in homeless assistance, an increase of 53 percent. Chronic homelessness over the same period increased 56 percent, and unsheltered homelessness increased 30 percent, affecting more than 380,000 in both groups last year. In fact, 58 percent of those counted as homeless in the point-in-time count last year were chronic and unsheltered. How does HUD justify increasing awards year after year when it is clear by your own data that more and more people are experiencing chronic and unsheltered homelessness over the life of the program? Secretary Todman. I will tell you, you know, we were taken back by what the point-in-time count in January of 2023 showed us in terms of the needs across the country. Since that time, January of 2023, we have deployed a number of funding provided to us by this subcommittee to make sure that we are helping folks on the frontlines deal with that 12 percent increase. We have sent funds to areas to help with encampments. We have sent funds to help with our young homeless individuals. But let me say this. When we took a deep look in the data of that 12 percent increase, what we found was that many of the individuals were first-time homeless that we believe were being assisted by the very robust social safety net that was created during the pandemic to make sure folks were not deemed homeless. And then when those different programs began to expire is when we saw an uptick. So we know that there is an issue. We have deployed some additional funds, and the '25 budget, as best we can with the constraints around us, has proposed funding to continue to help localities. Mr. Valadao. All right. And then continuum of care. California receives the highest amount of Federal funds of any continuum of care across the country. Last year HUD provided more than $525 million to California for this program. Unfortunately, these awards have failed to reduce the number of people experiencing homelessness. Focusing on the chronic and unsheltered populations over the last 10 years, chronic homelessness has increased 260 percent and unsheltered 132 percent. When HUD sees these large awards going out year after year to specific continuum of care and sees the constant increase in homelessness in populations year after year, what intervention or assistance does HUD provide? How does it ensure the taxpayer resources are not going to ineffective programs and are not mismanaged by incompetent leadership and are driving positive metrics? What is HUD's plan for improvement in the State with the highest unsheltered population in the Nation? Secretary Todman. Yes. So we know that the State and local leadership in California are doing lots of things and using our funds to address the homelessness crisis there. HUD does not provide its funds willy-nilly to our continuums of care. We actually have a competition. That competition is now on a 2-year basis, but the idea is to just prevent exactly what you're talking about. If we have a stable, well-performing continuum of care, they will continue to receive the funds that we have. When we don't, they don't. And so we are keeping an eye on that, and we are also providing technical assistance where necessary given the magnitude of the issue. Mr. Valadao. All right. Well, thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Secretary Todman. Thank you. Mr. Womack. And now the ranking member of the full committee, Ms. DeLauro. Welcome back. Ms. DeLauro. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I apologize again. It is hearing hopping here today. But just a quick thought. Maybe, Mr. Chairman and ranking member, as I said, I talked to a number of mayors yesterday, and I know you, Madam Secretary, you did as well. They talked about that there are several successful examples or projects, models that are dealing with the issue of homelessness. It may be worthwhile to bring those folks in to listen to this because it is such a pervasive issue nationwide, and to bring it more to the attention of our colleagues and what are the kinds of things--and also, I think it helps us in terms of what are the kinds of projects we should be funding, what initiatives would make sense. Anyway, let me--I reached out to my public housing authorities in my district, and this first question comes from someone you know, Karen DuBois-Walton. She is from Elm City's community in New Haven. And the second question comes from Jared Heon of the Ansonia public housing authority. We see a significant number of housing vouchers expiring due to a lack of units for individuals and families to rent. HUD exercised more flexibility to get people housed during the pandemic, and you made that point. Beyond significant investments in creating more affordable units, how is HUD thinking in the short-term and long-term to address low voucher utilization through greater flexibilities for subsidies, expediting lease-up changes to the fair market rent calculations, streamlining recertifications, or other means? Secretary Todman. No, thank you. And Karen is a tremendous leader and one of the best housers in the country by far. Let me say this. You know, we have learned through two different streams of work, both the flexibilities provided during the pandemic but also the flexibilities provided to moving toward agencies in terms of ways to streamline their program so they are focused on outcomes and not just paperwork. And through both of those streams we know some of the flexibilities that have worked. Some of them we have already put into place, like a more expansive use of our administrative fee to really incentivize landlords. But I know there is more that we can do, and so there is an internal working group at HUD as we speak talking about what are things that we can do inside of HUD's authorities so that we can carry on some of the flexibilities that you mentioned. But additionally, legislative proposals also has imbedded in them some of the things that we think can work that we don't have the authority to implement, and we need some statutory guidance from Congress. So we know that there is more streamlining we can do. The voucher program should be made much more streamlined than it is right now, and I am committed to doing that. Ms. DeLauro. Thank you. The Ansonia Housing Authority, smaller public housing authority, they want to expand their programs and services, especially for seniors. They don't have the income to sustain their homes but lack affordable housing options. These are people who have lived in what is known as the Naugatuck Valley in Connecticut. Discuss how HUD might help public housing authorities like the one in Ansonia address the housing supportive services needs of seniors. One idea that was raised in particular is the development of scattered site properties tied to project-based vouchers. Secretary Todman. So certainly we are, you know, a big proponent of, you know, project-based vouchers because it creates stability where if there is a senior with a voucher who can't find a unit, it is probably pretty traumatizing to not be able to find someplace secure. What project basing does, it provides stability in one site and then we can invite service providers to that site. Meals on Wheels comes to mind. I know a lot of senior buildings have Meals on Wheels as a successful partnership. But in addition to that, HUD does have our resident services dollars that go to housing authorities that can help support these kind of programs, and there are lots of models where housing agencies are working with local nonprofits and their local human services as well. So we can certainly make sure that those models, particularly models that are working for smaller agencies that may not have some of the bandwidth to create those partnerships, we can make sure that we are providing those models that I think can be replicated. Ms. DeLauro. I am down to 16 seconds. Will there be another round, Mr. Chairman? Can I just ask my last question? Mr. Womack. There will be another round, but if you have got another question, you are the ranking member of the full committee. Ms. DeLauro. Well, I know but I don't want to abuse my colleagues here. Very, very quickly. Cities today are restricted from using more than 15 percent of their community development block grants, those dollars on services. The cap prevents cities from spending more dollars on supportive services and emergency assistance like rent and utilities to keep people housed. Is HUD exploring measures to either increase or waive CDBG's cap on public services? Secretary Todman. I think that is certainly one thing that we can look to, and I know that we are interested in any and all ideas to use, you know, these resources, these valuable resources to achieve better outcomes. So happy to sit with you on some of the ideas that you are hearing. Ms. DeLauro. Thank you. Secretary Todman. You are welcome. Ms. DeLauro. Thank you very much. And thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Womack. You are most welcome. We will take that 45 seconds off Pete Aguilar's time. Mr. Rutherford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Secretary---- Ms. Todman. Yes. Mr. Rutherford . Great to see you. And thank you for all you do. Ms. Todman. Thank you. Mr. Rutherford. Listen, I met with the Northeast Florida Apartment Managers Association, a very large group, last week. They brought up an issue that I don't know if your Department is aware of. If you are, I would like to know what you can do about this issue. If not, I would ask if you could look into it. It is a little confusing, so follow me. They are running into a problem where they can't confirm a voucher-holder's--this is on the Section 8 voucher issue, going back to, actually, some of the bottlenecks that my colleague was talking about earlier. They are running into this problem where they can't confirm the voucher-holder's ability to pay rent because the public housing authority will not confirm how much the housing voucher will cover until there is an agreement in place with the landlord. However, the landlord--this is like a chicken-and-egg thing. However, the landlord or property manager may not be able to make that agreement until they know the prospective tenant's ability to pay, which is partially based on that voucher. So sometimes these voucher-holders are not able to rent these apartments, because they may not meet the income---- Ms. Todman. Right. Mr. Rutherford . Requirement without the voucher being counted in. Have you run into this anywhere else? Ms. Todman. It looks like we have a sequencing issue a little bit or maybe a process issue that, you know, most other agencies are able to overcome. So I am intrigued by what you said and---- Mr. Rutherford. Yeah. Ms. Todman . Would ask the team to follow up with your staff to see exactly what is going on. Because this is a process that generally works every day---- Mr. Rutherford. Yeah. Ms. Todman . In terms of what the tenant will pay, what the housing authority will pay---- Mr. Rutherford. Right. Ms. Todman . To get to 100 percent of the rent that the---- Mr. Rutherford. But if the voucher is not counted in their ability to pay, then they may not be able to rent that apartment. So---- Ms. Todman. I understand. Mr. Rutherford . I look forward to working with your staff on that. Ms. Todman. Okay. Mr. Rutherford. I really appreciate that offer. I want to bring up the multifamily housing complaint process. Ms. Todman. Okay. Mr. Rutherford. As I said, I am from Jacksonville, so I am sure you are familiar with the Calloway Cove---- Ms. Todman. Yes. Mr. Rutherford . Apartment explosion and fire that injured several people. And the indications were, from the HUD OIG, that complaints were not being properly followed up on, not handled in a timely manner, and that actually led to, potentially, this explosion. Two of the main recommendations that came out of the specific investigation of this incident have to do with developing a comprehensive process to ensure the complaints received by the clearinghouse are resolved in a timely manner-- that is No. 1. That is their recommendation. Number 2 is develop agency-wide policies and procedures for the intake, monitoring, tracking of health and safety complaints, and follow up on the mitigation. Some of the times, when you look at mitigation, it is up to, like, 17 days. That is just not acceptable. Ms. Todman. Uh-huh. Mr. Rutherford. So are these OIG recommendations on HUD's radar? Are you guys working on this now? And your fiscal year 2025 request includes $419 million for the Information Technology Fund. Are you looking to use that to assist with developing this tracking system? Ms. Todman. No--thank you. And so, first of all, let me say that it is horrible what happened at that site, and, you know, residents' complaints should always be listened to, and it is a manager's duty to make sure that people are living in a safe building. So let me say that at the top. As it relates to the complaints, right now HUD does have a decentralized process, because we do have partners who sit between us and those owners who are the intake system for those complaints. And we do get those reports, but they are coming from all across the country. So, yes, one of our IT investments is to find a way to take all of those complaints and centralize it in a way that HUD understands so those red flags can be raised. And that is an investment that I know our Office of Housing is looking to take on with our IT department. Separate and apart from that, last year HUD did start our new NSPIRE inspection program. It is the first time that the same inspection protocols for public housing, the types of sites that you are mentioning, and our voucher program, the same inspection protocol, that protocol is now focused on health and safety. The previous one was more focused on curb appeal. Mr. Rutherford. Okay. Ms. Todman. This one is looking inside the units. And we're hoping that when this is in its--it is in use right now, but-- when it gets really rocking and rolling we will be able to find these problems and address them more quickly. Mr. Rutherford. Thank you very much. And I look forward to working with your staff on the---- Ms. Todman. Absolutely. Mr. Rutherford . Voucher issue. Thank you. Ms. Todman. Yeah, I am intrigued by that one. Mr. Rutherford. Mr. Chairman, I see my time is up. I yield back. Mr. Womack. Mr. Aguilar, with a full 5 minutes. Mr. Aguilar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Acting Secretary, I will do the very best I can in the, you know, 35 seconds that the chairman has allotted me here. Appreciate his generosity. You have big shoes to fill---- Ms. Todman. Indeed. Indeed. Mr. Aguilar . As has been said before. Your predecessor served with many of us---- Ms. Todman. Yes. Mr. Aguilar . Not just in this chamber, but in these committee rooms. So thank you for signing up for this, and we look forward to working with you. Climate disasters--as the chairman mentioned, climate disasters--and the ranking member touched on this too-- wildfires, atmospheric storms, they have threatened the homeowners-insurance market, as well, across California. In the last year, 7 of the 12 top insurance companies in California have stopped offering homeowners-insurance policies in the State, threatening millions of middle-class Californians who are seeking to renew or get their insurance policies. Within the scope of HUD's jurisdiction, what can we do together to help address the rising costs homeowners face with respect to insurance while also, obviously, being a part of the affordable-housing-provider mix and the insurance that is available and required of these affordable-housing providers? Ms. Todman. Yeah. You know, I have yet to run into an apartment owner, public or private, who doesn't bring up the escalating cost of insurance as a problem, in terms of being able to maintain their operations or even finding insurance. So I thank you for putting that question out there. We have sat with housing providers about ways in which HUD can use its authorities. We have very limited authorities when it comes to the insurance industry, but what we can do is look at our roles and see ways that we can meet this moment. And I think it was just last week, if not the week before, we adjusted our wind and storm coverage to really help some of those housing providers deal with some of these escalating insurance costs. We are also working inside of the Public Housing Program to see if there are ways that we can address increased costs there. Sometimes agencies don't know that they can come to us and ask for additional funding to address, you know, some of the things that you have described. So, one, we are getting information out there on what people can do, but we are also taking a really precise look at our rules to see, are we requiring folks to get levels of insurance, perhaps, that they might not need to? I have heard that we sometimes require insurance on-- unnecessary levels of insurance on empty buildings. And so we are trying to look at commonsense things like that to see how we can address those costs. It is a real issue. I have met with mission-driven private owners of affordable housing who are saying to me that they can't stay in the business because they can't get insurance, but their market-rate units can. So there are lots of curiosities around what is happening right now inside of the insurance industry, but HUD is working with our owners with what we can do to help. Mr. Aguilar. Are there suggestions that you have to us or, you know, our friends on the authorizing side, flexibility that would be necessary in order to help? I mean, more of this is going to happen, whether it is California or Florida or Oklahoma, more of these climate disasters. Ms. Todman. We will provide those to you. We have a working group that has a--like, every single part of the housing portfolio inside of HUD has provided me with things that they can do. I will put on the table, ``Are there things that Congress can help us do?'' and we will make sure to get that to this committee and to the Congress. Mr. Aguilar. Thank you so much. Ms. Todman. You are welcome. Mr. Aguilar. I know you met with local leaders, a lot of us met with our local mayors---- Ms. Todman. Yes. Mr. Aguilar . This week as well, and specific to project-based vouchers. As Congress considers increasing the cap for project-based vouchers, what considerations would HUD suggest we keep in mind with respect to implementing a cap increase? Ms. Todman. Well, one of the things that HUD is going to do, from its part, is finally implement the project-based aspects of HOTMA, which was a law that Congress approved many moons ago. And so we are going to get that across the line. We think it will improve the administration of the project-based program. We are right now at a 30-percent cap, and, you know, there are some folks who feel that project-basing isn't always the best solution. But we also know that we see it working well, particularly when it is difficult for folks to find a unit with a voucher in their hand. So, as we do this body of work of ways to make the voucher program better, we will come back to you with things we think we need that can help with the authorizations in that program. Mr. Aguilar. Thank you so much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yield back. Ms. Todman. Thank you. Mr. Womack. Mr. Cline. Mr. Cline. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Madam Acting Secretary. Appreciate you being here. I want to return to the topic of homelessness and, in particular, the need for policies that prioritize holistic approaches to homelessness, encompassing both housing and essential support services. Do you think it is important that a person experiencing homelessness who has untreated mental illness with self- medicating substance-use disorders get treatment? Ms. Todman. I think it is important that anybody who has mental or physical illnesses get the treatment that they need. Mr. Cline. And you would agree that an addict who is addicted to methamphetamine or fentanyl should get treatment as well, correct? Ms. Todman. I believe that anybody who is having substance- abuse issues should have treatment available to them. Mr. Cline. Are you aware of the dramatic increase in overdose deaths inside federally supported Housing First programs? Ms. Todman. I am sure that there is an uptick. Mr. Cline. If I could, Mr. Chairman, I would like to insert into the record an article from the American Medical Association, JAMA, titled, ``Mortality Among People Experiencing Homelessness in San Francisco During the COVID-19 Pandemic.'' Mr. Womack. Without objection. Mr. Cline. Thank you. Should a person experiencing homelessness who has untreated mental illness with self-medicating substance-use disorders receive treatment before we provide them with a housing voucher? Ms. Todman. So here are my thoughts on that. In my experience, what I have found is that, if someone is stabilized in a home, not only is it easier to provide services but it is actually easier to even find that person. When someone is homeless and on the streets and going through sort of a mental trauma, it is difficult to provide services to them. But what we can do once someone has a home or is in a shelter, we are able to provide those services. Mr. Cline. Can you tell me what metrics HUD is using to assess the effectiveness of its programs in addressing homelessness, mental illness, and substance abuse? Ms. Todman. Our Emergency Shelter program and our Continuum of Care have a number of different metrics that we use. I am happy to provide those to your office. Mr. Cline. Thank you. And can you talk about how the data informing future policy decisions--how it is informing future policy decisions and resource allocation? Ms. Todman. One of the things that we do is, we listen to the folks who have to administer our programs locally about things that we need to do to make sure the program is effective. And we do that on a routine basis. Mr. Cline. And can you tell us how HUD is collaborating with mental health and substance-abuse treatment providers to ensure that individuals experiencing homelessness have access to the support services that are needed? Ms. Todman. Absolutely. So I mentioned before that there is sometimes a disconnect between housing and services, and one of the things we want to do is to braid those two a little bit more tightly together. We certainly do provide--our funds do provide an opportunity for services, not just housing. It can pay for services as well. I mentioned earlier that we have a new initiative with HHS to find ways to use Medicaid dollars to pair it with housing so people are getting the services that they need, whether it be, you know, of some mental trauma or it is something tied to substance abuse. Mr. Cline. Can you tell me how HUD is partnering with the faith-based community that provides housing assistance and supportive services? Ms. Todman. Well, certainly our funds that we provide our Continuums of Care, faith-based organizations have access to those funds, as well, in being part of that front line of providing folks with shelter, providing folks with interim housing, providing folks with services. Mr. Cline. Thank you. I would just say, I think we would all agree that simply providing housing without addressing underlying issues such as mental illness or substance abuse is a recipe for failure. And, with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Ms. Todman. Thank you, sir. Mr. Womack. Mr. Espaillat. Mr. Espaillat. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Congratulations, Acting Secretary. Ms. Todman. Thank you. And might I say, you have a fabulous name, Adriano. Mr. Espaillat. I will never, ever forget yours. Well, Mr. Chairman, in many ways, this--we have heard from both sides of the aisle on this great need that America has for housing. And it is really--what we hear is really a lack of money, investment. I think that maybe even from the Reagan years forward the Federal Government has become an absentee landlord. We haven't provided the funding for housing that it takes for families to have a roof over their heads. And so, as appropriators, it is incumbent upon us to make this a priority. And this is not an easy issue; it is a deep- pocket issue. Housing is never a cheap endeavor, right? It requires an investment. But it has a direct impact on the quality of life, obviously, of all Americans. And I heard from my colleagues from both sides, really, a similar story, similar questions to you, Acting Secretary. And nowhere is this more profound and more visible than in the NYCHA complexes of my district and across New York City. NYCHA has 360,000 residents, and it has over 177,000 apartments. But they are in dilapidated conditions. They are really in bad conditions. New boilers are needed; chipping paint; roofs, elevators are done. You know, the wear and tear of this housing stock has taken a toll on it, and it needs investment. In fact, the projection is that a 20-year capital investment need is for $78 billion. Now, get that. I am sure it is no different in each of our districts. The housing needs are so profound. So I want to know, I mean, what plan do we have in HUD to begin to address this humongous, humongous problem? Ms. Todman. You know--thank you for that, Congressman. As a country, we have not kept up with the needs of the public housing portfolio, as you so well stated. And, you know, we can do better, and we need to do better for the families who live in those units. It is one of the reasons why the President, for the past three budgets, has proposed billions of dollars of investment for our public housing sites, to deal with heating, to deal with basic--just making sure people have an operating kitchen, to get rid of some of the health hazards we talked about earlier. We have to and we must do more. You know, one of the things that we are doing, as well, is making sure that people have access to, you know, a streamlined version of the RAD, which is the only thing that many agencies, including NYCHA, is using right now to make those repairs. We are trying to make sure we are putting in our annual budget a capital fund amount that deals with it, but it doesn't--it really doesn't all the time. Mr. Espaillat. It is a drop in the bucket, really. Ms. Todman. But it is one of the reasons why we have proposed a $7.5 billion investment in our public housing sites, so we can begin the heavy work that you have talked about. And I think that that work, married with some of the things that we are already doing, will make a difference. But we must do more. Mr. Espaillat. And that is a call to this committee. This is the T-HUD Subcommittee. To make a priority out of housing again, I think, is imperative for our Nation, on both sides of the aisle. This perhaps could be a bipartisan issue that we could work on. Finally, Acting Secretary, there is a building in my district, 1915 Billingsley Terrace in the Bronx, that collapsed. And they are the recipient of--part of it collapsed--they are the recipient of Low-Income Housing Tax Credits. And it had previously been deemed structurally unsound in 2020. Had the structural needs been addressed, many residents wouldn't have had to live through this with this experience, right? What can HUD do to ensure that landlords keep up their housing stock when they receive these Low-Income Housing Tax Credits? Ms. Todman. Right. So LIHTC housing gets not one, most of the time, but two inspections there. There are requirements that Department of Treasury has that they are inspected every year, and then, if there are any vouchers in the building, HUD's--the housing agency is inspected as well. I think what I would like to do is maybe sit down with our leadership at Treasury and say, what more can we do together to make our inspections--making sure that our inspections are finding these issues before these tragedies occur? And I am happy to work with you on that. Mr. Espaillat. Well, I will invite you to come and see our NYCHA developments as well. Ms. Todman. Absolutely. I look forward to that. Mr. Espaillat. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Mr. Womack. Thank you. Mr. Ciscomani. Mr. Ciscomani. Thank you, Chairman. And I want to thank Acting Secretary Todman for being here today. Thank you so much. You know, safe and affordable housing is a key component of preserving the American Dream that I often talk about. And in southern Arizona, in particular, we are facing a severe homelessness and affordable-housing crisis, so this issue is a very, very high priority to me. Now, I believe that the Federal Government must get creative when looking at ways we can tackle this housing shortage, and that is why I called upon the administration to repurpose a small percentage of unobligated COVID-19 relief funds towards a deficit-neutral, multi-housing demonstration program to support the swift production of urgently needed affordable homes and leverage public resources through private investment. So I was very pleased to see the inclusion of a line item for a demo program of this nature in the budget request this year from you all. So, as HUD works out the details of this demo program, is this something that you would be willing to work with me on, on this project? Ms. Todman. Certainly. Mr. Ciscomani. Great. Great. Well, I look forward to working with you on that, and your Department, on this demo program as well as other innovative ways that we can assist our cities and towns with their housing issues. Any further comment on that that you have, regarding just getting creative on this, thinking outside the box? I don't think my community is the only one facing this, but certainly mine is, at a very high degree, in terms of homelessness and, just overall, the affordable-housing crisis. Ms. Todman. You know, I think that resources and innovation and being very outcome-focused is what we are going to need, and a lot of intentionality. And so a lot of innovation doesn't necessarily happen here in D.C. So much of it happens, you know, with the practitioners on the ground who have to get things done. And so we invite innovation from them and learn from them about the best ways that we can take what is happening locally and bring it to scale across the country. Mr. Ciscomani. Well, I am really glad to hear that. And, like I said, I was pleased to see that our inclusion made it there in the line item on the budget. I would love to take you up on that and work with you on that. I will move on to a second question here. The Federal Home Loan Banks have said they will be contributing $1 billion to affordable housing this year. They, along with HUD, play a key role in making housing more affordable, as we are discussing. How does HUD try to learn from and partner with Federal Home Loan Banks' affordable housing programs and vice versa? How does that relationship work? Ms. Todman. Yeah. So we have a strong working relationship with FHFA, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who has oversight over the Federal Home Loan Banks. And I know that the Director there has been very pointed in terms of her expectations on what the FHLBs do. And so that is our point of contact. We also work with, like I mentioned, our housing providers, who do receive sometimes gap financing to build homes from the Federal Home Loan Banks. But our primary relationship is through FHFA. Mr. Ciscomani. Great. So is this level of funding something that the private sector is looking for? Ms. Todman. Oh, absolutely. I think that there is--I was in a Senate Banking Committee hearing very recently with Director Thompson, and I do think there was a line of questioning there where she put on the table some of the things that she is going to be requiring of the Federal Home Loan Banks in terms of additional resources that they are bringing to the table. Mr. Ciscomani. Great. Well, I look forward to working with you on that as well. I will squeeze in one more here. You know, Arizona's Sixth District, mine, which I proudly represent, has a significant military presence, and our veterans are a vital part of our community. The HUD-VA Supportive Housing Program has been instrumental in providing housing and supportive services to our homeless veterans. Could you elaborate a little bit on the key lessons learned from this initiative? And how can HUD build on the program's success to expand supportive services and housing options for our veterans? Additionally, what role can Congress play in ensuring the continual expansion of these critical services to better serve our veterans and their families? Ms. Todman. So what VASH has taught us is that we can make a huge change in helping people who are homeless. Through VASH alone, we have reduced veterans homelessness by 50 percent over the past decade. That is a big number; it is a meaningful number. So I think that we can learn from the lessons of VASH in terms of the way in which we marry housing and services but also the way in which departments can work together. HUD has ``Housing'' in our name, but we are certainly not the only ones who can support the housing the country needs, and I think VASH is a great model of that. Mr. Ciscomani. Well, thank you so much. And I would encourage the Department to continue to prioritize programs like this one moving forward. Our veterans have sacrificed so much for us, and none of them should go without a roof over their head. Ms. Todman. Indeed. Mr. Ciscomani. So thank you so much. Mr. Chair, I yield back. Mr. Womack. Thank you, Mr. Ciscomani. Ms. Wexton is a valued member of this subcommittee and suffers from a health condition that requires her to communicate by extraordinary means, fascinating technology. And, at this time, I am going to yield Ms. Wexton the floor. Ms. Wexton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As members of the committee already know, last year I was diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy, or PSP. I describe it as ``Parkinson's on steroids,'' and I don't recommend it. PSP makes it very difficult for me to speak, so I use an assistive app so that I can participate and you can understand me. Welcome, Acting Secretary Todman. It is great to have you here. Last year, I spoke with Secretary Fudge about the Fostering Futures program, a Virginia program that helps teens and young adults in foster care after they turn 18. I was a guardian ad litem for many years, and ensuring those resources are in place is so important as these young people transition out of foster care. HHS manages a lot of the Federal work in this space, but HUD also plays an important role. Just a few weeks ago, HUD announced over $12.7 million through the Foster Youth to Independence initiative to public housing authorities to provide housing assistance to young adults as they make that transition. Can you please tell us about how the FYI program's targeted assistance has improved outcomes for this vulnerable population? And are there other ways HUD, or the administration more broadly, is working to invest in youth as they age out of foster care to ensure they are given the resources and tools they need to succeed? Ms. Todman. It is wonderful to see you. You know, I think the foster--and thank you for your leadership on this issue, is making a tremendous difference. I know that the work that HUD is doing to help foster youth who are aging out of the system is making a tremendous difference. I try to think of, you know, when I was 18, 19 years old and being told, go adult, you know, go find yourself an apartment, you know, go figure out how to pay your rent, do all the things--I mean, it is hard enough being in my 50s, much less being somebody who is 18 and being told, go into this brave new world and figure it out. So the least we can do to not just help our foster youth but also help prevent homelessness is to catch our young adults when they need us the most and house them. And so that program has been working very, very well, and we look forward to seeing it grow. One of the things that we have been doing is making sure that two systems are working with each other, and that is the housing system and the foster-care system. And so our leader inside of the Public Housing Program has met with his counterparts at HHS to make sure that we are in lockstep in getting these vouchers out the door and helping as many foster youth as we can. Ms. Wexton. Thank you. Last year, I also spoke with Secretary Fudge about HUD's work to stand up new Violence Against Women Act resources, which included a public-facing website that had just gone online shortly before our hearing in 2023. She was very excited about the resources, trainings, and technical assistance that would be available for anyone who might need them, both housing providers and regular people. So my question for you is, could you please give us an update about HUD's efforts to provide these resources and how the funding Congress has provided for these programs has been used to support survivors and improve outcomes? Ms. Todman. So we certainly have stood up our--or, it will be stood up this week--our new Gender-Based Violence Office. And we are certainly looking at ways in which we can staff that up very, very quickly, ma'am. In addition to that, our staff in our Fair Housing Office have been receiving sometimes very painful calls from survivors asking for HUD's help, and we have been helping them with the resources and the abilities that we have. So this is a priority for the Department. Ms. Wexton. Thank you. I yield back. Ms. Todman. Thank you, ma'am. Mr. Womack. Mr. Zinke. Mr. Zinke. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And welcome, Secretary--Acting Secretary. It is nice to see you. Ms. Todman. Nice to see you. Mr. Zinke. And, first, I want to thank you. Your staff in Montana has been very helpful in us navigating through multiple community projects and stuff. So your staff in Montana, I can say, has been very good. Ms. Todman. Good. Mr. Zinke. And thank you. There is an issue, though, that--you know, you don't learn much in headquarters; you learn a lot when you go to the front line. And so Montana Housing Authority has an issue that was brought to my attention. And it is an important enough issue that they came all the way to Washington, D.C., to talk to me about it. They shared with me the problem they are having, in fact, that the Montana Housing Authority has had $4.5 million swept from their reserve account. With that money taken, and more planned this year, it makes the problem come to the surface, and it is a big problem. In fact, it is such a problem, the loss of $4.5 million resulted in 576 Montana families that were unable to access housing assistance. And, then, a couple weeks ago, this same issue was brought forward to you during the Senate Banking Committee hearing. You were asked to reach out to the local housing authorities in Montana to try to navigate through this. To date, nothing has been heard from your office. And I just want your commitment that you will reach out to the Montana Housing Authority to get their input on how we remedy this. Because the sweeping of that account--I am sure everyone does it a little differently, but the reserve account in Montana, when it is swept, they can't go forward with existing contracts. So it is a problem. So if I have your commitment to work on that? Ms. Todman. Absolutely. The sweeping of the reserves only recently came to my attention, so I will learn more about that. And I will say, it was my impression that members of the HUD team had reached out to the Montana housing agency to talk about their fair-market-rent methodology. So I will double-back with them, but it is my impression that that connection happened. But I will confirm. Mr. Zinke. And you have my assurance, I will work together with you to remedy it, but it needs to be remedied. Ms. Todman. Absolutely. Mr. Zinke. And, then, just on philosophy, you know, we talk about, you know, renting vouchers, and you look at, you know, affordable housing and why is it so unaffordable. And in Montana, some of it, too, is that people from California are coming, and maybe California, you know, housing prices were more. So there is some of that. But a lot of it has to do with high inflation and--high inflation and also energy costs. So, when energy costs are high, material costs are high-- building material costs. That dumps into labor costs. And inflation--when we have high inflation, then you have high interest rates. And we are all suffering from that. So that house that was affordable before might not be under the current interest rates. I am particularly concerned about home ownership, you know. And I understand helping people through a rough spot in housing, but ultimately it has always been about home ownership. And the American Dream, a lot of it is built on home ownership. And when you live a life of renting and there is no opportunity to buy, home ownership, then a lot of it just--it dissolves, for many, the American Dream. And there is a lot of frustration from the younger people that look up and say, how do I afford a $1.2 million house in Bozeman, Montana? So some of it is, you talk about innovation. And I would offer this: I think we should look at a government-backed 50- year mortgage, because while you pay a lot of interest rates, I think lowering monthly costs--it is lowering monthly costs so people can afford something. And then I think we should look at expanding definitions of title. Because it gets very difficult to get a loan sometimes on a condo, but you know what? You own the title. And maybe we should expand our definition, on innovation, of what title looks like so a person can buy maybe a piece of an apartment or expand it so at least you own and gain equity in the title. It might not be the first title you own. Hopefully it is not. Maybe you can expand up. But the entry level for a lot of families on a three-bedroom, two-bath, two-car garage is too far. So I applaud your efforts in that. I just caution that, you know, spending--I think the source of the problem is getting after inflation, lower that. The source of it is getting after lower energy costs, crush the interest rates down, and look at opportunities for how to expand the opportunity for everyone to buy a home eventually. So thank you for everything. And, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Ms. Todman. Thank you. Mr. Womack. I thank the gentleman. We have completed our round of questions on round one. We are going to do a quick lightning round, if any of the remaining members have a question that they would like to ask, and I want to start. In January of 2024, HUD's Office of the Inspector General published an urgent management alert regarding improper payments in HUD's tenant-based and project-based rental assistance programs. It noted that the HUD leadership needed to take immediate action to resolve issues in estimating improper payments in those programs, the two largest at HUD. So can HUD share an estimate of its improper payments for last year for these programs? And have we made any progress in estimating improper payments for these programs since January of 2024? We are hearing a lot about improper payments. I know Chairman Arrington on the House Budget Committee is trying to tackle improper payments. And there are many areas in the Federal bureaucracy where improper payments are--the sum total of them are extremely, extremely high. Ms. Todman. Yeah. Mr. Womack. Help me understand where we are in improper payments. Ms. Todman. Well, thank you, Chairman. So, yes, the Inspector General at HUD and I have been having this conversation over the past several months, ways in which HUD can expedite its review of improper payments. It has been some years that we have done that, and I think that we were presented with a proposal that seemed like it was still too many years to go. One of the reasons is because some of the technological needs that we have to do it in an efficient way was--it was a heavy cost burden to the Department, sometimes eclipsing even a percentage of the improper payments that we had in our rental assistance programs. But we are going to expedite. And the commitment that I have made to really the whole HUD family but also the IG is that we will have an improper payment estimate by the end of next year. Having said that, the program has improved over the years in terms of making sure that there are no improper payments to begin with. And so, while perhaps 20 years ago there was an amount of improper payments that was unacceptable, with the advent of third-party verification that agencies use, some of the compliance work that we do with our privately owned sites, we have been able to have a much more stringent approach to HUD's payments so that we are keeping the public trust. And so we know that. That is in place. It is our obligation to get this body an improper payment number, and we are committed to do that. Mr. Womack. Thank you. Mr. Quigley. Mr. Quigley. All set. Mr. Womack. No further questions? Mr. Rutherford. Mr. Rutherford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Secretary, the Continuum of Care program, which I am very supportive of and really appreciate all that you all do in that, as you are aware, in Section 242 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, we gave HUD the authority to do that 2-year issue of the NOFO. And so this is our first year going through. Can you talk a little bit about the impact that that has had with the providers? Ms. Todman. We are enthusiastically looking to have this 2- year competition opportunity. You know, Continuums of Care need to be busy helping homeless people---- Mr. Rutherford. Right. Ms. Todman . Quite frankly. And, each year, they are trying to balance helping homeless people with applying to HUD for more funds so they can survive the next year to help more homeless people. So these 2 years, I think, are welcomed not just by the Department but also the COCs, and thank you for that. And we are going to be implementing it with much enthusiasm. Mr. Rutherford. Very good. Has it increased your participation of providers, or is it too early to tell? Ms. Todman. It is too early to tell. Mr. Rutherford. Okay. Ms. Todman. It is too early to tell. But I can tell you, it is welcomed, and we look forward to it. Mr. Rutherford. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Secretary. And I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Womack. Mike, any final remarks? Mr. Quigley. I just thank Madam Secretary for being here and your good work. We look forward to working together with this committee. I think the chairman is right; we have a good team here who wants to get appropriations done and done on time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Womack. Thank you. With that, our time has concluded. Thank you for being here today, Madam Secretary. To my colleagues and to their staffs, anyone that has questions to submit for the record, please do so within 7 days to the subcommittee staff so that we can get those included into the record. Mr. Womack. I want to thank you for being here this morning. We look forward to working with you as we continue the fiscal year 2025 appropriations process. And, with that, the subcommittee stands adjourned.

MEMBERS' DAY Chairman Womack. The subcommittee will come to order. Good morning, and welcome to this year's Member Day Hearing. Today we welcome our colleagues to testify on their priorities for the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Transportation for fiscal 2025. As the ranking member and I noted in our dear colleague letter inviting our members to come before the committee, member engagement is key to the appropriations process. Our bill is unique as every district nationwide has housing and transportation assets. Last week, we heard from the DOT and HUD secretaries, who provided a helpful national view. But as a former mayor, I understand how important the local perspective is. That is why I am looking forward to hearing from our colleagues, who I consider to be the subject matter experts on these issues in their districts. With that, I want to recognize my ranking member and good friend from Illinois, Mr. Quigley, for any comments he would like to make. Mr. Quigley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This committee --this subcommittee funds programs that impact every district in our country, whether it flies, floats, or rolls, or provides a family with a safe and stable roof over their heads. The programs in this bill create jobs, keep communities safe, and help advance our Nation's economy. We welcome feedback on how we can work on a bipartisan basis to support the work of a member--of members of this body, DOT and HUD, and the other independent agencies. I look forward to hearing testimony from members today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back. Chairman Womack. Thank you, Mr. Quigley. Today we kick it off with a gentleman from Guam, Representative James Moylan. Every member will have the standard 5 minutes to testify and your full written remarks will be included in the record. Please be sure to turn your microphone on when speaking and off when you are finished. Congressman Moylan, you are recognized. ---------- -- -------- Wednesday, May 8, 2024. HON. JAMES C. MOYLAN, A DELEGATE IN CONGRESS FROM GUAM Mr. Moylan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Chairman Womack, and Ranking Member Quigley, for holding this hearing and for all the work that you do funding critical agencies like the Department of Transportation and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The government of Guam agencies rely heavily on Federal grant funding in order to supplement their meager local budget. Without robust funding for these grants, our local agencies will struggle to properly provide for our constituents. Guam's Port, Airport, Housing and Urban Renewal Authority, and Department of Public Works need funding for grant programs that benefit communities in the States and Pacific Territories. First off, in fiscal year 2023, the AB Won Pat Guam International Airport in Tamuning greatly benefited from the Department of Transportation's airport improvement program. Thanks to this grant, the airport has been able to start addressing their structural deficiencies. Since Anderson Air Force Base is restricted to the Department of Defense, Guam's International is the only airport on the island for civilian use. This makes grants like the Airport Improvement Program vital for Guam. With the anniversary of Typhoon Mawar approaching, I am reminded of how vital the airport was in disaster recovery efforts, allowing for emergency response personnel to rapidly assist those living in Guam and addressing construction problems. The Airport Improvement Program has undoubtedly proven itself as an essential part of building Guam's capability, and with our recently submitted Airfield Lighting Vault Rehabilitation community funding project, I hope that this subcommittee can appropriate the necessary amount to keep Guam's air industry alive. Second, HUD's Community Development Block Grant for the Insular areas is a lifeline for our local Guam Housing and Urban Renewal Authority. GHURA is currently fighting a losing battle on island to ensure that there is enough housing for the ever-growing population of COFA migrants coming from the Marshall Islands, Palau, and the Federated States of Micronesia. The existing housing supply is stretched thin due to the complications associated with building resilient housing on island, and this issue will be exacerbated by the continuing military buildup. Guam expects to add thousands of marines relocating from Okinawa over the next few years, and there is not enough housing on bases. This means these service members will take their off-base housing allowance outside of the fence, driving up the cost for housing for those civilians on island. Service members housing allowances have led to the creation of an inflated floor for the cost of rent for everyone on island and local wages are not always able to meet these dizzying costs. And lastly, the insular Community Development Block Grant needs more funding so GHURA can build more affordable housing on island. This is a simple supply and demand issue. If we are not building enough housing, then it will become increasingly difficult for civilians to afford rent on their own homes going forward. Insular CDBG grants have not been increased in years and with massive inflation and the tyranny of distance, the funds do not go as far as they used to and GHURA is struggling to make up the shortfalls.    T7284A.070 Chairman Womack. Thank you, Mr. Moylan, for joining us and for your testimony. It is always a pleasure to hear about the needs of your community and particularly the impact of the COFA migration, if you will, onto the island of Guam. We share your interest in making our Nation's airports among the world's best, and we recognize the situation you have there in Guam. I do have one quick question for you, and that is you mentioned the housing allowance and the fact that Okinawa is-- some of the marines who previously occupied Okinawa are being displaced to Guam. So it hadn't occurred to me, but in your testimony, you talk about how that has created kind of a--that floor threshold that you talked about, kind of created kind of a false sense of, and has driven up the cost, I guess, of housing. Can you expound on that just a little bit more? Mr. Moylan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And yes, and we, the island of Guam does welcome the Marine Corps, the defense of our Nation. The importance of having the Marines there is very welcomed. Since the buildup has started, we have had a lot of service members continuously coming on out and with their cost of living allowance, they are able to afford a higher level of rental. Real estate market realizes that that far outweighs our local economy and what the regular civilians are paid compared to Federal funds. It is putting a great pressure and demand for folks that are not Federally employed. And the money is just not there for local folks to gain housing. In addition to that, those with higher salaries and can afford more. It is also the tyranny that our distance to getting our supplies, our building materials is extremely high. The shipment that costs--the product that may cost something on the west coast is like 100 times more. You basically double it by the time it reaches Guam. So you are building material--and we had to build resilient homes. They are not wooden homes. They are concrete, solid homes to withstand super typhoon winds. So the building code is high. The amount per square feet to build a home is extremely expensive. Building costs, we are behind. There is some reports that saying were several thousands homes that we don't have ready to go. So our housing market is low, the demand is high. We are looking at more folks coming on in, either from the COFA agreement or from the military. And with the military buildup comes additional construction workers, additional support services, talking about tens of thousands of people eventually by the time this buildup is completed. We are also short on labor force, too. We were fortunate to extend the H-2B workforce, which specifically comes from the Philippines, for another 5 years. So these contractors are secure that we can do this contract because we have them for this long. We need to extend that. But they are restricted to working on military projects. That is why they were brought in. And our existing workforce, contractors, they are working inside on military projects as well. So those that the workforce that is able to help businesses recover from the super typhoon help residents build their new homes. The price went up again. And we are so restricted in the amount of people that can provide structures, whether it be for commercial use or whether it be for family use too, that is what we are dealing with. So with your help through GHURA, that is going to assist some folks. But really that is one part of the puzzle and we are still working on others so we can reduce our cost of goods or reduce our cost of labor and get more workers so we can supply this. Our concern, in addition, is when is the next storm coming on in that is going to damage on the outside? Of course it damaged the buildup process too, but we are going to have damage to our commercial businesses, we are going to have damage to local homes. We, as a community, we had to come together, working closely with the military to ensure this can be completed. And with your help, Mr. Chairman and the committee, it will be really important and helpful. Chairman Womack. You do have some unique challenges. Mr. Quigley. Mr. Quigley. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that you brought up resilience in your construction and how important that is going to be because as you know all too well, the number and severity of storms has increased. So we want to work with you there. I also appreciate the Chairman bringing up and highlighting the issue you raised with housing shortages exacerbated by the Marines moving into Guam and, in many cases, transferring from Okinawa. So I think it is incumbent upon us to recognize that, and I hope you stay in touch with us on that matter to work on additional housing on that base because there were all the issues that related to try to build it elsewhere that you have detailed. And I appreciate you raising CDBG. I think we have been at $3.3 billion for CDBG for somewhere between 3 and 5. It is also important to recognize, I don't believe you can use it for new housing, CDBG, it still needs to be increased. But on this matter, we are going to have to work in concert with our authorizing colleagues with you. We will be glad to do that. If you want to comment on any of that, great. But otherwise, thank you for your testimony. Mr. Moylan. I appreciate the statement and I want to work closely with the committee as well to see how we can help move this forward. It is greatly appreciated. Thank you. Mr. Quigley. Thank you. Chairman Womack. Thank you, Representative Moylan, for your testimony here today and your full comments will be included in the record. Next, we will turn to the Chairman of the House Ag. Committee, who I am sure is going to give us an indication as to how that farm bill is coming. We will leave that for a different day, GT. GT Thompson from Pennsylvania. Sir, the floor is yours. ---------- -- -------- Wednesday, May 8, 2024. HON. GLENN THOMPSON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA Mr. Thompson. Mr. Chairman, thanks so much. Chairman Womack, Ranking Member Quigley, members of the Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing, Urban Development, it is just an honor to be able to sit before you. Thank you. Thank you for the opportunity. Representing one of the most rural districts east of the Mississippi river, access to quality infrastructure, reliable transit, and resources for economic development is critical to farmers, small businesses, manufacturers, and others throughout my district that spans one third of the landmass of Pennsylvania. In order to achieve these goals, I request robust support for the following programs in FY 2025. Starting with Essential Air Service. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 made airlines the sole authority to determine which domestic markets would receive air service, as well as what airfares passengers would be charged. Subsequently, the Essential Air Service program was established to ensure taxpayers in small rural communities had continued connectivity to the entire national transportation system by subsidizing commuter and certified air carriers. Now, this program is critical in rural America and has provided links to hub airports at more than 170 locations throughout the United States and that would otherwise lack commercial air service. Representing many rural airports in my congressional district, including two that participate in the EAS System program, I see firsthand the importance of maintaining this program for all Americans who live in underserved rural areas. Our Nation's small and rural communities depend on commercial air service for transportation, medical supplies, commercial goods, access to larger business markets, and, quite frankly, economic development. Therefore, I respectfully request subcommittee fully fund the EAS program at no less than the FY 2024 enacted levels in FY 2025. Bus Testing Facility program. The Bus Testing Facility program at Penn State University, operated by the Thomas D. Larson Pennsylvania Transportation Institute, tests new transit bus models for safety, structural integrity, reliability, performance, durability, noise, and fuel economy. The program tests bus new bus models before they are purchased by transit agencies. This often helps address problems before the fleet is built, potentially saving considerable money and time. Since the beginning of this program, more than 530 new bus models have been tested, resulting in more than 10,000 documented design failures. By identifying these failures early in the production process, the program has averted many fleet failures, saving millions of dollars in maintenance costs, litigation, and lost revenue. Therefore, I respectfully request this subcommittee provide $7.346 million in total funding for this program in FY 2025. Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvement Program. In 2015, Congress created the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements program to improve safety, efficiency, and reliability of the rail network. Through public private partnerships and cost sharing agreements, program recipients can invest and capital project systems to prevent derailments, grade crossing enhancements, and more. This program advances major maintenance projects that shore up first mile and last mile connections served by short line railroads, allowing goods to move more seamlessly to and from the market. Representing hundreds of miles of short line railroad track in my district, these investments are critical to improving and extending the service life of vital freight transportation networks in rural areas. Therefore, I respectfully request full funding for this program in FY 2025. And the Appalachian Development Highway System was created in 1965 to stimulate economic development by connecting isolated areas of Appalachia to the interstate system in the Nation's integrated transportation network. The project allows these isolated areas to benefit from greater access to their surrounding communities and broader markets. While more than 90 percent of the initial authorized ADHS miles are completed and open to traffic, funding is necessary to complete the remainder of ADHS. My district is home to four unfinished ADHS corridors that would better connect with thousands of my constituents to our Nation's transportation network and result in increased economic growth. Therefore, I respectfully request subcommittee increased dedicated ADHS funding in FY 2025 so these projects can be completed in an efficient, timely manner. I have included additional requests on my written testimony, including for robust funding for the FAA Contract Tower Program and the Community Development Block Grant, and I would also respectfully request consideration of the three community project funding requests I plan to submit within this committee's jurisdiction. Thank you again, Chairman Womack, Ranking Member Quigley, and members of the subcommittee for allowing me to express my priorities for the FY 2025 cycle. I appreciate your consideration. Look forward to working together on these and other issues.    T7284A.071   T7284A.072   T7284A.073   T7284A.074 Chairman Womack. Thank you, Chairman Thompson, for joining us, for your testimony this morning, and for your work in your other capacity as well. And we wish you the best of luck as you work toward that farm bill. Mr. Quigley. Mr. Quigley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, chair, I don't have a question, but I think your testimony reflects on a couple things that I think need to be pointed out. A little over a week ago, I went with Chair Womack, the chair, and the ranking member of the full committee to Baltimore, to a disaster of what needed to be done. And it occurred to me, talking to the mayor and the governor there, that they probably had the best group there they possibly could on bipartisan basis, people who were serious about what occurs across the country, regardless of whether it is D or R. So hearing your testimony to me, it struck me that I represent O'Hare. But I want you to know I fully appreciate that to you and your constituents, those two airports are a lifeline, have absolutely critical link to the rest of the world, including medical supplies and economic development. So I think it reflects that we need to remind ourselves that there is more that unites us than divides us. And I should care just as much about your airports as you do mine and the rail links as well, so your constituents know you serve them well today in that regard. And I want to stay in touch and work with you on those concerns and needs. Mr. Thompson. Mr. Quigley, thank you for much, and thank you all for visiting Baltimore. The agriculture implications of what happened with that terrible incident with the bridge---- Mr. Quigley. It is a link to the Midwest. Mr. Thompson . Are huge. Fertilizer, farm equipment, it is a major port that serves both inputs coming in and outputs being manufactured from America's number one industry, which is agriculture. And I will say most of my phone calls I get today are about that bridge and about when we can start to move, you know, move the economy. So thank you for doing that. Chairman Womack. Mrs. Watson Coleman, any questions? Mrs. Watson Coleman. No, Mr. Chairman. I just simply want to say thank you very much for a very comprehensive look at your priorities. And as you were sharing your priorities, I was envisioning your district, so thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Thompson. Thank you. Chairman Womack. Thank you. Mr. Thompson. Thank you, Chairman. Chairman Womack. Honored to have you. Now we will turn to representative Stanton for his testimony. Mr. Stanton represents the fourth district of Arizona. Welcome to the subcommittee. Anxious to hear your testimony. ---------- -- -------- Wednesday, May 8, 2024. HON. GREG STANTON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Quigley, members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify in the importance of Federal investment to meet Arizona's transportation and housing needs. My office, as all offices across Congress, are in the process of vetting dozens and dozens of potential projects for community project funding. So many of them fall in the THUD space. Affordable housing, construction to keep our pedestrians safe and our traffic moving, and infrastructure to charge our vehicles are all on the docket. And I look forward to working closely with this committee to invest in Arizona. Thanks to $158 million in Federal funds flowing through the Federal transit agency, we recently officially opened Northwest Extension Phase 2. Light rail in my community now extends from Mesa in my district all the way to Metro Center in the West Valley, linking the downtowns of three major cities, job centers, and campuses like Arizona State University in my district. I urge the committee to continue to robustly fund the Federal Transit Administration. We also received funds to create a scope and schedule for commuter rail between Phoenix and Tucson. This would be huge in the state of Arizona, connecting our communities, making them more accessible and productive. This investment means that people in Arizona can travel for work, for recreation, and to local businesses to bolster the economy in their day-to-day lives. I urge the committee to continue to robustly fund the Federal Railroad Administration. Last year, Arizona received over $13 million in Federal funds to purchase zero emission buses and necessary infrastructure. This transition not only improves air quality, but it significantly lowers long-term fuel and maintenance costs for Valley Metro, saving the taxpayers and helping the flow of residents all over the valley. So, please consider robust funding for the Bus and Bus Facility Competitive Grant Program. Aviation is such an important part of the Arizona economy. Arizona's aviation economy supports almost 20,000 jobs, contributes billions to our state and country. We have 3 of the top 10 busiest general aviation airports in the country, with Sky Harbor in Phoenix as one of the busiest. The overall aviation infrastructure needs through the Nation are projected at more than $150 billion over the next 5 years, almost $3 billion in Arizona. The Airport Improvement Program is vital for the continuation of these efforts to reconstruct and rehabilitate our airports. Please consider fully funding the AIP program in your fiscal year 2025 bill. In Arizona, we have seven contract air traffic control towers, including Phoenix Mesa Gateway Airport, one of the busiest--the busiest contract tower in the country. Mesa's important air traffic safety program maintains and develops general aviation activity and supports DOD flight training, operation, and military readiness, as well as pilot flight schools across the country. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 authorizes a pilot program to convert high activity contract hours, like Phoenix Mesa Gateway, to FAA-staffed visual flight rules towers while allowing qualified contract air traffic controllers, of which over 70 percent are veterans, to remain at their current tower. I urge this committee to consider funding level of $30 million to establish this pilot program. Air traffic is more than planes, it is drones as well. My bipartisan bill, the Drone Infrastructure Inspection Grant Act was incorporated into the FAA reauthorization bill. Funding the implementation of the DIIG Act would assist states, Tribes, and cities in using drones to inspect aging infrastructure such as bridges, roads, dams, and the electric grid more efficiently than ever before, identifying and rectifying issues at the earliest possible stage, saving money and even lives. I urge the committee to include language in the fiscal year 2025 Appropriations bill and fund this program at the authorized level of $12 million. Last, all the work we do in transportation is in close coordination with our local and state agencies. This year, Arizona received a $95 million INFRA grant to make major improvements and widen Interstate 10. This grant represents a unique partnership of governments involving state, Federal, Tribal, and county governments in the planning and development of the grant to address the safety infrastructure needs in Arizona and within the Gila River Indian community. This project would not have been possible without significant Federal resources, and I encourage robust funding to these programs in fiscal year 2025. Thank you so much for this wonderful opportunity to address this important committee in these critical times. Thank you, Chair.    T7284A.075   T7284A.076   T7284A.077 Chairman Womack. Thank you. Spoken like a true mayor after my heart. Mr. Quigley. Mr. Quigley. Thank you for your testimony. So tell me, there is some long-term grandiose plan for comprehensive public transportation in the region, like regionally coordinated. You mentioned light rail, you mentioned commuter rail. Is there some longer term plan to do this on a much larger scale? Mr. Stanton. Yes. On the ballot in Arizona, in Maricopa County this year, will be an extension of the sales tax so that the region can provide matching funds for Federal grant programs such as light rail, people mover systems, streetcar systems, et cetera. Although, as you know, certain communities in my--the ones that I represent, Mesa, Tempe, Phoenix, are very big on light rail and the opportunities of light rail. We have had over $14 billion of private sector investment along our light rail, a massive success. Some cities have a different political philosophy. They are not interested in light rail, so we need to make sure that in the plan, it is done in a bipartisan way with mayors of both Republican and Democrat coming together, and that all their priorities are met. So some of them are more interested in highway construction or arterial street construction, and we need to support that as well. Striking a city like, just like in your region, Maricopa County, it is a diverse group of cities, over 24 cities that make up the region. It is complicated and so striking that balance, which is amazing that they were able to come up with a single plan. It is called Prop 479. That will be on the ballot to serve all of those needs. Chairman Womack. Good luck. Thank you. Mrs. Watson Coleman. Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Representative Stanton. The one thing that is very illuminating for me, and I am so glad I am here, is that we have so much---- Chairman Womack. Turn that mic on, please. Mrs. Watson Coleman. Oh, I thought it was, I am sorry. One of the things that is most illuminating for me is that no matter where we are, we have similar needs. I have got an airport. It is not O'Hare. It is an airport that is regionally important. You have one, the representative before that had one, the representative before that has one. And we all have needs associated with that. And the same thing with CDBG and housing and things of that nature. So those things that sort of bind us and the work that we need to do are more important and significant than those things that divide us. And I am so glad to be here, Mr. Chairman, and to hear from my colleagues what their priorities are. Thank you. Chairman Womack. Thank you. Mr. Stanton. Only if I respond real quickly, and that is I am a recovering mayor in Congress, and one thing I lamented as mayor was we needed a better partnership from the Federal Government, and we need to be better partners. This committee is the committee that actually is the very best partners to local government around the country, and I am very appreciative of that. Thank you so much. Chairman Womack. Thank you for your testimony. Without objection, your full testimony will be entered into the record. And finally, we move to our friend from New Jersey, Jefferson Van Drew, from New Jersey's Second District. Sir, the floor is yours. Please turn that mic on and proceed. ---------- Wednesday, May 8, 2024. HON. JEFF VAN DREW, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY Mr. Van Drew. I am either in good shape or bad shape because you used my formal name, Jefferson, but that it is. Thank you all for the work that you do. I appreciate it. I really mean it. Chairman, Ranking Member, and my old friend for many years from the New Jersey legislature. I spent 16 years. Bonnie, I am not sure, how many years were you in the legislature? Sixteen, yeah. So now we are colleagues again. So, it is good to see you all, and I appreciate the opportunity to testify before you. I will get right to it. The William J. Hughes FAA Technical Center, a great congressman that we had in New Jersey for many years, it was named after him. This year's FAA reauthorization includes provisions that will codify South Jersey's William J. Hughes Technical Center, thereby making it permanent and permanent in New Jersey. This historic win for New Jersey will expand the technical center's role and make responsibilities within the FAA even greater. We need to make smart investments to support them and their expanded mission. I advocated for such investments to be included in the President's budget request. The fiscal year 2025 budget request does, in fact, include historic levels of infrastructure funding for the technical center. I request the committee match these levels by providing the following funds from the FAA facilities and equipment account: $23.4 million for the technical center laboratories. These funds will be used to bring the laboratories into compliance with power and security standards for the critical national airspace systems that are based at the technical center. Thirty-nine million for the William J. Hughes Technical Center infrastructure sustainment. These funds will modernize the main electrical utility substation that powers the entire technical center. We should know that this is a bipartisan request supported by my friend, Congressman Donald Norcross, who represents the district next to me. Many of his constituents work at the technical center, and I do appreciate his support, and I want that on the record. Community project funding. I have six community project funds. These are all priorities and I request they be funded at the full requested account, if possible. And I know it is a tough job you all have. I have included identifiers in my testimony to allow committee staff to easily locate the requests if they need to do so. The first request is $4 million for the economic development account to construct a dental hygiene school at Atlantic Cape Community College. Unfortunately, the committee has informed me that this project might not be eligible due to a prohibition on healthcare facilities. This is a little different. It is an educational facility. I just, from the heart, want to say how important it is. You know, the county that I happen to reside in, I have six counties in my district. The county I reside in was the only county in the state of New Jersey that didn't have a county college. And I fought for, worked for, advocated for, and again, in a bipartisan way with many individuals through the years to finally convince the powers that be in Cape May County to go into a jointure with Atlanta County, and we have the Atlanta Cape May Community College. People think of my area as the shore, and it is. Beautiful homes right on the beach worth tens of millions of dollars. Many folks that are extremely challenged in rural parts of my district, parts of my district, counties in my district have the lowest per capita income in the entire state. Trying to give folks opportunity. Dental hygiene, and I speak from experience, I am a dentist, does that. It is actually one of the few things that you can get a 2-year degree in, and you can go on for a 4-year or even get your master's, but get a 2-year degree and practice hygiene. We are critically short of dental hygienists, not only in the state of New Jersey, not only in southern New Jersey, but in the country. So it creates opportunity and it fulfills a need. It is purely an educational project. It is close to my heart. So I would like to work with you all, if we can have any reconsideration, just to make sure that there is no way and no path forward. I think that there might be. It is not a healthcare facility as such. It is an educational facility, and it is also an economic development tool. It really is for the entire area. The second request is for $2.5 million to design and prepare a site for Aviation Maintenance Training Academy from the economic development account. This project will change generations of much needed aviation maintenance workers. Again, we need decent jobs for people and opportunity. The project is supported by the United States Air Force. It has their support and it has matching non-Federal funds from private sector partners who are interested in recruiting from this facility. That is important. Any funds we do are going to be matched in the private sector by this maintenance training academy. Third request is for $650,000 for the city of Millville baseball field safety improvements. It might seem trivial. It is not. Millville, another very challenged town. I know that Bonnie is familiar with it. Member Coleman I should say. It is a town that has a lot of working class, poor people, high unemployment, has an unbelievable baseball program known nationally. You are going to know one of the names that were the result of this, Mike Trout. Mike Trout came out of this program. It is a great program. The city is poor. I don't know how else to say it. They have a hard time maintaining these fields, maintaining the infrastructure in the fields. And they have had other MLB players, by the way, come from there. It is their economic cultural cornerstone. It used to be the glass industry. The glass industry is gone. It is reminiscent of the Rust Belt. If you go through Millville, lots of beautiful areas, good hard working people, really challenged. They are deteriorating with improper lighting, improper field conditions, and a lack of protective nets. This is for safety more than anything else. It makes the field safety for generations of ballplayers. It is quite an amazing thing. If anybody wants to see their program, please let me know. Fourth request, $800,000 for the Wildwood tram cars from the transit account. The tram cars are a beloved and iconic fixture of the Wildwood Boardwalk, if anybody has ever been there. The requested funds will be used to replace eight of the tram cars with more environmentally friendly engines, hybrid engines, rather than the pure fossil fuel engines they use now, and importantly, to make them ADA compliant, which they are not ADA compliant right now. And again, we have a match. The improvement district has advanced about a half-million, in fact, $480,000 as a non-Federal funding match. They have already done it. Fifth request is for $4 million for the Atlantic City airport, rail station, and cargo spur from the consolidated rail infrastructure account. These funds will be designed and engineered. They prefer alternatives from a feasibility report that was completed last year. You are welcome to that report. It offers benefits in terms of intermodal transportation and economic development. It is strongly supported, strongly supported by many institutions. I will just include a few of them: our university, Stockton University; strongly supported by our healthcare system, the AtlantiCare system itself; and the South Jersey Transportation Authority. Again, we have money, has advanced $1 million in Federal funds as a non- Federal match. We are putting our local money there to make sure that we are not just talking, but that we are walking here and we are putting, you know, we are putting something into the game. Final request, $1.76 million for the NAB Avenue extension from the highways account. The project also promotes intermodal connections, but with the Millville airport, another airport that also has a museum, another airport. And again, Member Coleman can relate to this because I know what she is going through with her airport that is struggling a little bit, but has real potential. We are working with them. The funds will be--design 1.3 miles of new roadway that will redirect congestion from the downtown Millville area and promote commerce in underserved areas of the city, such as Cumberland County has. Cumberland County, I have six counties, that is one of them, poorest county in the state of New Jersey. And yet they have advanced, again, money where our mouth is, $445,000 as a non-Federal match. Already done. I appreciate you guys, and I appreciate you listening to all of it.    T7284A.078   T7284A.079   T7284A.080   T7284A.081 Chairman Womack. Thank you, Mr. Van Drew. Mr. Quigley. Mr. Quigley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your testimony, sir. You know, I listen to testimony and you make a really good case for your district, and that is your responsibility and that is important. But I think if I have learned anything being here 15 years now, is that members know their district a hell of a lot better than we do, which is exactly why it was right thing to do to bring back these programs, to give members that. Because if members don't know their districts, they are not going to be members very long. So it just, in my mind, reinforces that there are fiscal constraints and broad rules, but I have a mind to take members at their good judgment of what's right for them. So, and I also want to add, I was a Cook County commissioner for 10 years, and we had a public health system within that county. There it was reinforced just how important dental care was. I always thought of it as you keep your teeth and they are clean. But I learned from the experts there just how important it was for the wellbeing and health of people long term, particularly people who have neglected their teeth or their dental care for so long. So I certainly appreciate that, but also for detecting other things like cancer. So I want to reinforce your comments and statements. And again, thank you for your testimony. Mr. Van Drew. Ranking Member, I appreciate you, and I agree with everything you said on just two issues. One, you know, I have spoken loudly and strongly and will continue to do so for what we now call community grants. It used to be called earmarks. We've got more transparency. So, you know, some of the issues that people worry about aren't there. And just to be real frank about this, I would rather than a bureaucrat that may not know my district very well and the needs and desires of all of our districts for us to have input in that. So I have strongly supported and openly supported that process. And secondly, about the dentistry, you are right. In fact, the more we know and the more we learn, actually, other health problems not only--for example, I will give you an example, people that have some really--gum problems, it is called periodontal disease. That actually connects to and is related to inflammatory diseases and heart disease as well. So it is really important. And in underserved areas, you know, those areas I just see--it's amazing. When I went through dental school and even after, when I did my residency, part of it, I did it in the South Bronx. If anybody is familiar where that is, it is one of the toughest places in the country. And I had kids that were getting dentures at 15 and 16 years old because of a lack of care, because of drug addiction, because of other problems, and it led to other health problems. So it is an important piece, and that is why I advocate for it so hard. And if there is any pathway, I think it is a really worthwhile endeavor. Mr. Quigley. Mr. Chairman, if you will indulge me, I visited Howard Brown. They are just opening a dental clinic in my neighborhood in Lakeview. And they told me firsthand that some of the people were getting their first dental care or their first dental care in over a decade. And beyond everything you just mentioned, some of them getting implants and, you know, teeth pulled out, their emotional wellbeing was enhanced dramatically, their sense of who they are, but their ability to eat what they want and their health dramatically altered who they were and how they felt about themselves. So I would just add that and thank you again. Mr. Van Drew. Thank you, Ranking Member. Chairman Womack. Thank you, Mr. Van Drew. Mrs. Watson Coleman. Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you very much. Clearly, the Hughes Center has been a very important part of New Jersey and on behalf of the country, too, as well. I mean, and to be named after this wonderful legislator is just wonderful. So, Jeff, there is no question that you know your district, because the diversity of requests and I am thinking as you are talking about the various towns and how it is going to impact, because I do know that area, clearly, these are very legitimate and worthy projects that need to be considered on behalf of our citizens in New Jersey. Thank you for being here. Mr. Van Drew. Thank you. I appreciate you. Thank you. Chairman Womack. Jeff, as always, thank you so much for your testimony. Mr. Van Drew. Thank you. Chairman Womack. Without objection, your comments will be included, full comments, in the record. I want to thank all the members of the committee and for those who testified this morning, Representatives Moylan, Thompson, Stanton, and Van Drew. Look forward to hearing more member input through the fiscal year 2025 appropriations process. As I said earlier, everyone's written statements will be included in the record. And with that, this hearing is now adjourned.

INSPECTORS GENERAL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, AND THE NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION (AMTRAK) WITNESSES HON. RAE OLIVER DAVIS, INSPECTOR GENERAL, DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT HON. ERIC J. SOSKIN, INSPECTOR GENERAL, DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION KEVIN H. WINTERS INSPECTOR GENERAL, NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION (AMTRAK) Mr. Womack. The subcommittee will come to order. Today we welcome the Inspectors General from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Transportation, and Amtrak. Good morning to our witnesses, the HUD OIG, Rae Oliver Davis; the DOT IG, Eric Soskin; and the Amtrak IG, Kevin Winters. Thank you for appearing before us today and for your service to the tax-paying public. One of our fundamental roles as members of the Appropriations Committee is to make sure that the funding we allocate is spent as intended. We look to IGs across the Federal Government to conduct oversight to ensure our tax dollars are being well-spent. We rely on you to help us root out waste, fraud, and abuse at the agencies under your jurisdiction. I have some concerns regarding the management and effectiveness of DOT and HUD, given the unprecedented federal funding both Departments have received in recent years. I have similar concerns with Amtrak which, although a for-profit organization, receives billions of dollars in combined annual appropriations, and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, or IIJA, advanced appropriations. Your audits and investigations provide a critical window for policymakers and members of the public to peer through. I am most interested to learn about the outcomes of your various reports, which recommendations have been implemented and which have not, and where additional congressional attention may be needed. I was pleased to meet all three of your offices' budget requests for the fiscal year 2025 House bill. I and the entire subcommittee recognize the important work you do. We look forward to your testimony as we make the tough decisions that will be required as we conference with the Senate to finalize a fiscal year 2025 T-HUD bill. With that, I recognize the ranking member of the subcommittee, my dear friend and the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Quigley, for his opening comments. Mr. Quigley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I appreciate your comments, particularly as to the critical role our Inspectors General play, and we appreciate your service toward that end. I join you in welcoming our witnesses today. And I will keep my opening statement brief so we can proceed with questions, but I do want to underscore the importance of this hearing and anticipate your questions. All this shoulder injury is from hockey, not being in Congress. But examining the management and the oversight challenges facing the agencies' funding in this bill helps this committee make informed decisions about how we invest our resources. Whether it is health or safety hazards in the home or workplace, a changing workforce, or private sector development outpacing Federal regulation, there are opportunities to enhance the work of Amtrak, DOT, and HUD. As these agencies are leading the modernization of our Nation's infrastructure with support from historic investments made through a Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, their commission is some of the most complex public-private transactions in the housing and transportation sectors. Of course, as part of this historic undertaking, there are and will continue to be lessons learned. There we are. Now I got to start all over. I believe the Amtrak CEO Stephen Gardner, Secretary Buttigieg and Secretary Todman have what it takes to effectively run these agencies. And I am here today to learn how I can strengthen my work with them to make sound improvements. I look forward to learning more about how the agencies funding this bill are meeting their management challenges and where they can make progress. Thank you for being here today and I again thank my friend the chairman. Mr. Womack. Thank you, Mike. This morning, we will begin with the DOT's Inspector General, Mr. Soskin. Mr. Soskin, your full written testimony will be included in the record, and you are now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Soskin. Chair Womack, Ranking Member Quigley, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the invitation to testify today about our office's oversight of the Department of Transportation's programs and activities. I am pleased to appear alongside my HUD and Amtrak counterparts, IGs Oliver Davis and Winters. The independent and objective oversight that our offices each provide serves a vital role in keeping the Federal Government effective and accountable and providing transparency to the American public. I greatly appreciate the subcommittee's interest in and support of our work. At DOT OIG, we conduct audits and investigations that promote economy and effectiveness in DOT's programs, that provide information to Congress and to the American people, and that detect and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse. This mission affords us a unique perspective of the challenges DOT faces. My testimony today focuses on three areas from our work. First, DOT strives to make the U.S. transportation system the safest in the world. Conducting data-driven assessments of risk and implementing effective mitigation actions is, therefore, critical. For instance, while traffic fatalities have decreased by 5 percent from their 2021 high, DOT still faces a tall task in its work to ameliorate surface transportation safety risks. In the aviation safety realm, FAA has taken important steps but is still working to address several of our recommendations related to the 2018 and 2019 Boeing 737 MAX crashes, including improving risk assessments after safety events. Our office is also completing a review of FAA's oversight of Boeing's 737 and 787 aircraft production. We will be issuing a report with recommendations next month. Second, the Department is charged with improving infrastructure while ensuring prudent stewardship of taxpayer dollars. In fiscal year 2023, DOT's contract and grant obligations totaled $112.3 billion. This is a more-than-50- percent increase from fiscal year 2019, influenced by COVID-19 relief funding and the IIJA. As these funds flow, DOT must focus on oversight that ensures compliance with Federal law; that prevents fraud, waste, and abuse; and that promotes competition. Our recent reports have pinpointed weaknesses in contractor and grantee oversight, resulting in millions of lapsed and inactive funds, unsupported costs, questioned costs, and improper payments. Another challenge as DOT administers these IIJA funds is posed by increased domestic content requirements. For example, we recently issued a report describing weaknesses that hindered FTA's oversight of buy America requirements. This looked specifically at the southeastern Pennsylvania transportation authority's now-terminated contract to purchase rolling stock from the state-owned China Railway Rolling Stock MA Corporation, CRRC. But our audit made recommendations that will apply more broadly. Third, DOT has taken on the ambitious and imperative goal of transforming our transportation system. Key challenges include maximizing the benefits from airspace modernization and strengthening cybersecurity. In addition, DOT will need to act thoughtfully to attenuate safety risks without inhibiting the ability of companies and other players to innovate in numerous arenas. On one hand, the primacy of safety is deeply woven into the Department's DNA. On the other, the Department justifiably takes pride in the history of American leadership in modes ranging from rail to automobiles to aeronautics, leadership that has helped make our country secure and prosperous. Striking the balance required to sustain this leadership while protecting the traveling public is no easy task, particularly when multiplied across a myriad of modes, technologies, and use cases. For example, FAA has made recent progress in using its authorities to permit additional beyond-visual-line-of-sight drone operations in north Texas and nationwide. However, FAA is still working to issue its notice of proposed rulemaking and eventually a final rule to make such operations routine, scalable, and economically viable. Meeting the Department's many goals will also require DOT and all of its employees to aspire to organizational excellence and to be staffed with high-caliber, dedicated public servants, whose activities are measured and monitored with data as they work in our new, often telework-friendly, environment. Mr. Chair, this concludes my prepared statement. I am happy to answer any questions you or other subcommittee members may have. Mr. Womack. Thank you so much. I now recognize HUD's Inspector General, Ms. Oliver Davis. Your full written testimony will be included in the record, and we are going to recognize you now for 5 minutes. Thank you. Ms. Oliver Davis. Good morning, Chairman Womack, Ranking Member Quigley, and members of the subcommittee. Thank you for inviting me to testify about my office's oversight of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. HUD's programs provide critical funding to communities and households throughout our country. Its 2025 fiscal year appropriations total more than $60 billion in grants for rental assistance, preventing homelessness, revitalizing communities and promoting economic development. Another $94 billion is available in HUD's disaster recovery and mitigation programs through supplemental appropriations. Additionally, HUD ensures trillions of dollars in mortgage loans to provide affordable housing and homeownership opportunities, and creates liquidity through these various loans through Ginnie Mae's mortgage-backed securities program. It is a portfolio that has grown to over $3.6 trillion in mortgage-backed securities as of August 2024. HUD's programs continue to expand as our country faces significant and complex challenges in the housing space. There is not enough affordable housing to meet the demands of American communities. The affordable housing stock is old and in need of major repairs that are costly. The funding needed to improve conditions at these properties has consistently outpaced HUD's funding levels. Current economic conditions may create liquidity crunches for many of the independent mortgage non banks that HUD relies on now to service loans and provide payments to investors. There is legitimate concern about the impact that an economic downturn could have on servicers' ability to operate and whether Ginnie Mae will have to take on responsibility for servicing portfolios like it did in 2022, with the collapse of Reverse Mortgage Funding. Natural disasters are expected to continue more frequently and with great severity. Permanent authorization of disaster recovery and mitigation programs would reduce the time it takes for HUD funds to reach local communities in need. My office's oversight strategy is centered on helping HUD maximize the outcomes that its programs and funding generate and strengthen HUD's capabilities to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse. We are focused on protecting taxpayer funds and ensuring they can deliver better for the communities and families that rely on HUD's important programs. We have identified over 30 open recommendations across HUD's programs as priorities for HUD leadership to address. For example, our office has recommended HUD do more to enhance controls that prevent fraud before it occurs. HUD also needs to ensure that its over 40,000 contractors and grantee partners are held accountable for assisting in fraud detection and prevention. Similarly, we have identified that HUD remains chronically challenged with identifying the extent to which improper payments are made in its two largest rental assistance programs. HUD has been unable to estimate the amount of improper payments in these programs for the past 7 years. Funds spent in these programs total more than $45 billion in payments in fiscal year 2023 alone, and make up over two-thirds of HUD's expenditures. Estimating improper payments is the first step in finding why they occur and creating a plan to reduce them. In its oversight of safety hazards in assisted housing, HUD needs to ensure that property inspections are performed within required timeframes and that complaints about health and safety risks in multifamily properties are resolved timely. Recently, we examined large housing authorities' management of health hazards in the public housing and voucher programs. Our reports identified that households are living in units that simply do not meet quality standards at a minimum. We also found instances where HUD authorities are not properly assessing lead-based paint exposure or properly informing HUD of lead poisonings in their units. We will continue prioritizing this type of work to ensure HUD's programs' partners are accountable for providing decent, safe, and sanitary housing to our communities. We have a strong partnership with the Department of Justice in combating sexual assault and misconduct by landlords receiving HUD funding. This work has secured settlements with landlords to provide monetary damages directly to victims. It has resulted in agreements that they will never again be landlords and, thus, never be in a position to victimize vulnerable tenants again. To conclude, I am proud of the hard work that my dedicated staff is doing and the robust oversight that we are providing. And I also want to thank the subcommittee for their continued support of our budget, and I look forward to working with this subcommittee in the future and answering any questions you may have today. Thank you. Mr. Womack. Thank you. Finally, it is time to recognize Amtrak's Inspector General, Mr. Winters--our resident Devil Dog and Marine Corps retired brigadier general. Thank you for your service to our country. Your written statement will be included in the record, and you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Winters. Chairman Womack, Ranking Member Quigley, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to discuss our oversight of Amtrak's programs and operations. Although Amtrak OIG is relatively small, about 100 auditors, investigators, and support staff, I am very proud of their independent and objective oversight efforts on behalf of the American taxpayer. This is an unprecedented moment in Amtrak's history. Not only is it charged with providing safe and efficient transportation to its customers, but it is also advancing its largest capital portfolio in its 53 years of rail operations. With access to as much as of $66 billion from the IIJA, Amtrak is in varying stages of modernizing its fleet, tunnels, bridges, stations and technology systems. Indeed, Amtrak has numerous multibillion dollar infrastructure programs and rolling stock procurements now in design or execution. The infrastructure programs include participating in the $40 billion Gateway Program in New York and New Jersey, constructing the $6 billion Frederick Douglas tunnel under the city of Baltimore, and replacing multiple large bridges, such as those over the Susquehanna and Connecticut Rivers. Amtrak's rolling stock procurements include three that are the largest in its history: First, replacing its legacy Acela fleet; second, procuring new inner-city trains; and third and the one likely to be its most expensive, replacing its long- distance trains. Any one of these would be a generational endeavor, but Amtrak is engaged in all three simultaneously. In our view, the pursuit of these multibillion dollar capital programs presents a host of transportation improvement opportunities for our Nation, but they also present significant challenges and risk. That risk is amplified by the fact that Amtrak still must meet obligations that are difficult under the best of circumstances. That is, running safe, efficient, 24/7 passenger rail operations, and providing excellent, fiscally responsible service to its customers. Our work indicates that Amtrak recognizes the complexity and seriousness of this moment and is taking steps to proceed responsibly. Nevertheless, the scope of this simultaneous undertaking is daunting, and our work highlights that there is no shortage of lessons learned and room for improvement. Accordingly, we believe Amtrak's programs and operations require robust oversight by those in a position to do so, such as us in the OIG, Amtrak's board of directors, the Federal Railroad Administration and, of course, Congress. For our part, we will continue to strategically focus our limited resources on Amtrak's most serious challenges. For now, they fall into three broad categories: First, the challenge of running a safe and secure railroad that efficiently and effectively serves its customers; second, responsibly executing its historic capital improvement plans; and third, reducing the ever-present risk of fraud, waste, and abuse. Finally, we trust that the information we have provided to your committee now and over the years proves helpful to your oversight of Amtrak. And we appreciate your longstanding support to our office. So I thank you and I look forward to our discussion today. Mr. Womack. Thank you. I know that members on both sides of the aisle have a lot of questions and that we are looking to this panel for answers. We will proceed in the standard 5-minute rounds, alternating sides, recognizing members in order of seniority as they were seated at the beginning of the hearing, which promptly began at 10 this morning. We will try to move quickly so everyone can get their questions in, so, members, please be mindful of your time and allow our witnesses time to answer within your 5-minute turn. I am going to recognize myself for 5 minutes. While this hearing will mainly focus on the critical oversight you provide, I want to be sure that you are getting all that you need from the administration and from the agencies which you oversee. As you know, these authorities are provided to you by laws, such as the IG Act of 1978. To that end, a couple of important housekeeping questions. Do you have any issues getting prompt, timely access to staff, personnel, or documents when conducting investigations from the agencies which you oversee? We will start to my left with IG Winters. Mr. Winters. No, I do not. Mr. Soskin. We have strong relationships with the Department and the OAs, and we have always been able to get all of the information that we need. Mr. Womack. Okay. Ms. Oliver Davis. Yes, Chairman. I would agree. We have strong relationships as well. Sometimes things required a bit more conversation throughout my tenure, but we get to a good place. We are good. Thank you. Mr. Womack. I want to talk IT for just a minute. Do you have your own IT systems with a firewall between your files and the agencies which you oversee? Mr. Winters. We do not have our own IT system. We rely on Amtrak's. Nevertheless, we have sufficient internal controls to ensure that our audit and investigation data is adequately protected. Mr. Womack. So internal controls, are you in a position to test those and see if they are stressed at all? Mr. Winters. Yes, we are. And we can see if Amtrak is, in fact, penetrating our system, and to date, they have not. Mr. Womack. Okay. Mr. Soskin. Yes. To protect our independence, we maintain a separate IT system that we oversee. And we have in place controls consistent with Government cybersecurity policies to prevent unauthorized access, including by the Department. Your question mentioned firewalls, and we do not maintain a firewall per se, because we use the Department's network and there is no practical and affordable way to install a firewall without significant additional investments. We are confident in our security, and we would be happy to have our staff brief you further on the details of that. Mr. Womack. Okay. Ms. Oliver Davis. Yes, we are completely independent. We have a firewall as well as executives that oversee our IT. Yes. Mr. Womack. A couple of open-ended questions on best practices. How regularly, if at all, do you use your 7-day letter authority? If rarely, how do you resolve issues with your agencies before reaching the point of having to send such a letter? Mr. Winters. At the outset, I think it is important to note that the 7-day letter is a very important tool for IGs, and we appreciate the congressional support in instituting that tool in our arsenal. That said, I have never had the occasion, at least as the IG of Amtrak, to use a 7-day letter. But to resolve disputes-- and disputes are normal for IGs, because we are auditing and we are investigating and we are getting after data, and there are very thorny issues that need to be navigated--one of the things we did is develop--is we and the company developed--what is called a relationship policy, which is basically a dispute resolution mechanism that solves these issues at a staff level. And if there is no resolution, there's a gradient, an upward gradient in terms of getting to the appropriate levels to get the thing resolved. So that has worked. In the nine years I have been at Amtrak, that has worked very well, and we never had an occasion to use a 7-day letter. Mr. Womack. Mr. Soskin. Mr. Soskin. IT Winters did an excellent job explaining the importance of the 7-day letters. Like Amtrak OIG, neither I nor our office, to the best of our staff's knowledge, has issued a 7-day letter. When issues arise with an audit or investigation, that is one of those tools out there, the existence of which helps us resolve those issues quickly by reaching out to the appropriate Department officials, and communicating openly. That is an important part of those relationships that we have worked to establish and maintain. Mr. Womack. Good. Ms. Oliver Davis. My colleagues couldn't have said it better. And I will echo the gratitude for the tool, the 7-day letter. I have never had the occasion to use it in the last 5 years. We also try to escalate disputes and conversations up through the Department, ending with myself and the Acting Secretary. The one thing I would add that is a little different is sometimes I do choose to take things out of our audit resolution process and issue what is called a management alert. I have done that for several important issues, whistleblower protections, improper payments, things in our lead portfolio. So that is something that I do that is a little different, but it is not a 7-day letter tool. Mr. Womack. At least you have got the tool in your toolbox should you have to go at some high-torque answer, you know, or resolution to a challenge. Finally, and this will be quick, have any of you ever been concerned about being as transparent with Congress or the public as you would like? Has it ever been an issue? Mr. Winters. No, it is not. Mr. Soskin. While there are occasionally some transparency challenges, we are confident we have been able to share the information, particularly with Congress, that we need to share. Ms. Oliver Davis. Absolutely. I mean, the Department definitely has its privileges. We have had issues around cybersecurity discussions, that sort of thing. But I have never felt it inhibited our oversight or ability to be transparent with our stakeholders here or the public. Mr. Womack. Thank you. Mr. Quigley. Mr. Quigley. Thanks again, Chairman. Ms. Davis, if only to afford you the opportunity perhaps to do a deeper dive involving disaster recovery oversight. As you know, it has been 2 years since Congress provided long-term housing and transportation disaster relief. This is in the wake of 2023 and 2024 disaster from Francis Scott Key to Maui, major hurricanes in the South, tornadoes in the Midwest. No shortages of disasters in these last few years. I would like to hope that, working on a bipartisan basis, as that trip to the Key Bridge demonstrated, we will come to terms with that. But, given the role HUD plays in long-term recovery of communities, housing, schools, or rebuilding its businesses, what do we need to know about your office's needs and resources, particular to that and given the numbers that we are going to be seeing on a continually growing basis? Ms. Oliver Davis. I appreciate that question. I am certainly grateful that the subcommittee is attuned to our need for resources. Any time we see a supplemental come out to address disaster, we hope to see funding certainly for our oversight. The one thing I would add is the money takes a while to get spent. That is the nature of disaster recovery. It is also some of the challenges in getting the money out the door as well as having the grantee spend the money effectively and expediently. So often we are looking at years following with our own oversight. So having funding that is not tied to a particular fiscal year, giving us a little flexibility, is often a very good thing. Yes, that would be very helpful. Thank you. Mr. Quigley. And you were talking before about fraud detection and other aspects. What are the unique challenges associated with this that your office faces? Ms. Oliver Davis. Well, frankly, our office has limited resources, and we are in a bit of a follow-the-money, chase- and-pay situation with our oversight. The main recommendation we have made there that I think would be most helpful is if the Department, the policymakers, those administering the programs would get in front of the fraud. We are looking for them to do fraud risk management on the front end, particularly with the level of grant funding that is going out through the Department. We are hoping to see a top- down approach to that within the Department. We are seeing progress. This has been an ongoing conversation for us. We did a look at HUD's fraud risk program Department level- wide, and found it to be ad hoc or, you know, just beginning, just starting. We have historically seen that the Department looks to grantees to manage the fraud. Something that is happening there in our portfolio that is really interesting, a strategic thing we have done is we are now taking those fraud risk management audits to the grantees themselves. You mentioned disaster relief. We just looked at the Puerto Rico grantee, given it is the largest. And we found that they too have an ad hoc, or just very beginning fraud risk management program. So that is where we are at with fraud risk management. We want it to be at the department level. We want it to be early and often, and we look for that to mature. We are seeing maturity at the Department level. They have a policy now. They are incorporating fraud risk management in their front-end assessments of programs. So we are hoping that will just continue to mature. Mr. Quigley. No. I mean, disasters bring out the best and worst of us. We saw in the Midwest after tornadoes that the fraudsters move in the next day to exploit those who have been through horrible situations. So I appreciate your remarks about front-ending this and being aware, incorporating it into all their practices as we go forward. So I appreciate that. Ms. Oliver Davis. Thank you. Mr. Quigley. Mr. Chairman, I will have other questions. I yield back on this. Mr. Womack. All right. I recognize the sheriff for 5 minutes. Mr. Rutherford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that. And I want to say thank you to our three witnesses here today. Thank you all for what you do. It is extremely important to folks around the country. I want to ask a very parochial question here, if I might. Ms. Davis, does the OIG--I am from Florida, and we have had some issues with the CDBG-DR money that is block granted to the State. And we have had some issues with not only our HUD properties, but also individual property owners. And I know the State is trying to work through this with--I think they had a subcontractor that failed to follow through and do their job. So my question is, on a CDBG grant, once we block grant that to the State, does OIG still maintain some investigatory responsibility for that? Ms. Oliver Davis. Yes, sir, we do. We follow the money, so to speak. If the money goes to the grantee, we have the authority to audit that grantee, investigate the use of funds. Something we are looking at now with respect to grantees is, you know, outcomes. We are trying to do more outcome-based work. So yes, we do. Mr. Rutherford. Even when the State's doing the contracting? Ms. Oliver Davis. Yes. Yes, absolutely. And, actually, it is a challenge certainly, because we--we see grantees--the money goes beyond the grantee to subrecipients, contractors. Often we have trouble getting that data, and that is a lot of times where we see the fraud and improper payments. So yes, but we do attach to that still. Mr. Rutherford. Excellent. Are you familiar with what is going on in Florida with the RMO (ph) CDBG, the RMO? Ms. Oliver Davis. I know there are challenges with CDBG in general, yes. And if there is more that you would like to raise my awareness to, I would be happy to meet and discuss those things. Mr. Rutherford. Love to. Okay, thank you. Ms. Oliver Davis. Yes, thank you. Mr. Rutherford. Let me jump over to Mr. Soskin. I want to talk a little bit about ATC staffing. In the spring, the chairman had hearing with Secretary Buttigieg, and he talked about hiring 2,000 more controllers in 2025. That is really important to me because, again, I am from Jacksonville, and our air traffic control center is in that funnel. And we have had 300 staffing triggers, which means delays, you know, planes are diverted, that sort of thing. Can you talk about this--I know one of the things that FAA is talking about doing is trying to move some of their training--and I assume that is the ground training that they are doing--to universities and others outside of their own academy. Can you talk a little bit about that? Do you have any concerns and how is that going? Mr. Soskin. Well, the Jacksonville facility that you mention, that is one that we are familiar with. We highlighted, in fact, in our audit report a year or two ago about air traffic controller staffing issues, the extensively high number of staffing triggers there and the bottlenecks in air traffic controller training that have developed, in part, as a result of limited capacity at the FAA Academy and part as a result of a number of protracted pauses that were put in place on training, both at the Academy and then the field training that takes place in control towers and air traffic control facilities themselves as the pandemic continued. That has led to a real staffing backlog. The program that you are describing--the program to allow students graduating often with degrees in air traffic control from certified or recognized air traffic control colleges and universities to then move more directly into the in-the-field training--is a tool that the Department feels holds extensive promise for unblocking some of that backlog of training. But what is important is that it won't be a swift process for a controller to be fully effective in all situations that air traffic controllers encounter and that it not be a drain on the time of trained controllers to carry out that training. That is a process that will take years. Mr. Rutherford. Thank you very much. I really hope we can stay on top of that with the colleges and make sure that it is a smooth transition, but I thank you for that. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Womack. Real quickly on that subject. With colleges involved in the training, is there any kind of accreditation process that--I will leave it with that question, you know, accreditation issues associated with farming out that training? Mr. Soskin. Yes, Chair Womack. I can follow up specifically afterwards, or have our staff follow up with some of the specific requirements, but the FAA's in-college or college training initiative does involve certifying individual programs to participate. So schools that currently have degrees are not automatically advancing their students, their graduates, to be controllers. They actually have to be certified as part of this. I had an opportunity to visit Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida last year. Their facilities to begin that controller training process are quite remarkable. I understand in the past, they have had a very high success rate of their graduated controllers then going on to successfully complete the FAA Academy. Mr. Womack. Thank you. Mrs. Torres. Mrs. Torres. Thank you, Chairman. Mr. Soskin, I am really glad to hear about you looking into the controller issue, training for them and including other opportunities so that people don't have to fly out out of State in order to get the proper training that they need. Ms. Davis, thank you for being here today. My questions are going to be to you. I want to emphasize also the importance of the following points I am going to make. Properties involved in HUD programs must be completely free of dangerous materials, contamination, and toxic chemicals. However, despite HUD's efforts to eliminate hazards in its assisted properties, there are still several safety and health issues that need to be addressed. In your testimony, you highlighted that your office oversees State and local governments that receive Federal funding. You also note that your office prioritizes oversight work aimed at reducing environmental and public health hazards in HUD-assisted housing. The Housing Authority of the city of Los Angeles has received Federal funding and requires increased oversight. I will make that point again. The Housing Authority of the city of Los Angeles has received Federal funding and requires increased Federal oversight. Since 2004 that I am personally aware of, this agency has endangered the public health of the communities that it serves and its employees. An article in the L.A. Times from that year described workers being forced to remove tiles containing asbestos without proper protection or equipment. Subsequently, Cal/OSHA investigators found concerning issues related to asbestos in Housing Authority properties. And in 2005, after many attempts to get them to correct these problems, they issued a willful violation for their negligence. I want to know how is it that agencies communicate to you when they fail to comply with minimum standards, protections for their tenants, for their workers? Recently, it was reported that an investigation will be conducted in Watts after a study revealed several homes with lead contamination in the water supply. According to the study carried out by the Better Watts Initiative, 21 out of 540 water samples from verified Watts addresses, including single-family homes and public housing units, contained lead. It is unacceptable that the poor working-class people are forced to live in dangerous conditions by an agency receiving the bulk of its money in Federal dollars. And I demand to know how housing providers are being held accountable for complying with environmental laws and regulations to protect the health of low-income households and vulnerable populations and to correct housing injustices. The mayor at the time, by the way, sent a letter requiring a medical surveillance program be instituted to follow those tenants and those workers. That was never done. So how does your office ensure that the Federal funds are being used to address this negligence, focusing on housing authorities? Ms. Oliver Davis. Thank you for that question. You have hit on a part of our portfolio that is taking up a remarkable amount of our resources and our time, because it is a very challenging part of the HUD portfolio. Everything you are talking about, asbestos, you didn't mention infestations but there are plenty of those, lead paint, all of that falls squarely under my Environmental Justice Initiative. We have a robust audit side of the house that is doing a remarkable amount of work in that field. We are going out into communities with our investigators. We have teamed up with DOJ and U.S. Attorney's Offices, and we are doing community outreach. I just was in Richmond, Virginia, two nights ago with the U.S. Attorney and our staff. And we are telling community groups what we want to hear from them. And we are learning while we are there. Often, I am talking about lead, certainly unit conditions and how people are suffering. And they are raising our awareness and telling us about more things we didn't know. Mrs. Torres. So why don't we follow up with you, because we are really out of time, but I do want to leave you with this: To the record, I want to enter an L.A. Times, ``Asbestos Removal Lacked Safeguards, Workers Claimed'' in Los Angeles as well as all of those willful violations that they have received back in 2004 to 2008 period of time, which has triggered, for me, the issue that I want to hear directly from you: How is this agency able to continue to perform so poorly and continue to receive Federal dollars without being held accountable for the injustices that they are creating targeting people of color, by the way? And I yield back. Mr. Womack. Without objection, the material is added to the record.    T7284A.096   T7284A.097   T7284A.098   T7284A.099   T7284A.100   T7284A.101   T7284A.102   T7284A.103   T7284A.104   T7284A.105   T7284A.106 Mrs. Torres. Thank you. Mr. Womack. Mr. Valadao. Mr. Valadao. Thank you, Chairman. I appreciate all of you taking time to testify today. Ms. Davis, good to see you again. We spoke last year about sexual abuse in public housing, and you touched on it again this year in your testimony. We agree that HUD tenants should not have to choose between having a roof over their head and being sexually harassed or assaulted by their housing provider. Can you go into a little detail on your actions, on the actions your office is continuing to take regarding sexual harassment or sexual assault in HUD programs, and what have you learned over the past year and a half? Ms. Oliver Davis. Thank you. This is a very important initiative to me. One thing I have learned is that this is very much a deep-seated program. I think this--deep-seated problem that I believe has been a part of these programs for quite some time. We have landlords, management companies, people in positions of power over tenants. We certainly have vulnerable individuals that are being housed in HUD housing. And often, the landlords know about these vulnerabilities. They know what these people are facing. They are willing to evict them, ruin their credit, do all sorts of horrible things to them in exchange for sexual favors. It is a remarkably difficult thing to hear about. And we have opened, I think, 50-plus complaints and investigations since we started this initiative. Again, I just mention we are going out in the communities. When we go out to the communities with DOJ and our U.S. Attorney partners, we are talking specifically about sexual misconduct. I have talked about some of the successes, unfortunate successes that we are having in this area, but we brought $4.3 million back to victims in one of our cases in New Jersey, $175,000 in, I believe, Ohio. We have an ongoing effort here. It has caused us to stretch. I mean, our agents are taking trauma-informed training. It is an entirely different way of operating. But it is something that I feel very passionate about. It is something that we are going to commit resources to and continue to work on. Thank you for asking about it. I appreciate it. Mr. Valadao. I appreciate that answer. If there is something we need to be doing more from the legislative side, obviously, we want to be active on that front. And last, I wanted to ask you about your audit of the California Department of Housing and Community Development in August of this year. I saw that the Department was not prepared to adequately detect and prevent fraud, which is not a new issue in California. Can you briefly explain what you found in your report, and have any steps been taken to fix the issue? Ms. Oliver Davis. In terms of steps to fix the issue, that is something I will have to follow up on. But we have looked beyond the HUD level down into the grantees, looking to see how they are preventing fraud, because we have seen at the Department level, the attitude typically has been fraud is not something the Department needs to address, but something the grantees need to. I don't think the requirements are being put on the grantees to do this. I don't think they have some of the training that they need to do this, or the capacity at times, but they are struggling. A lot of times we see that the approach is reactive. So we are looking for them to do things like best practices, put hotlines in place, put controls in place to prevent fraud. We want to do what we can to protect the funds. Yes. Mr. Valadao. Since I have got time for my third question, I also wanted to touch on a report that your office issued in January of this year regarding systematic challenges with improper payments. This report highlighted HUD's continued inability to complete a compliant estimate of its improper payments for the seventh consecutive year. Can you explain in more detail how this has been allowed to occur for so long, and does it appear HUD is making an honest attempt to fix this problem? Ms. Oliver Davis. This is an area that we continue to see the Department struggle with. And, again, as you mentioned, it is tenant-based rental assistance. It is project-based rental assistance. It is over 60 percent of HUD expenditures. It is upward of $46 billion. The last time they had a significant estimate, they were able to arrive at an estimate, I think, for 2016. It was $1.7 billion at the time. So they are missing an opportunity to be transparent with the public about a risk that they have in their grant systems. What we have seen is problems collecting the information. We have seen problems in arriving at a sound methodology. Often they want to look at their first level of transaction payment out. We want to look all the way down. Where's the money going after it goes out HUD's door? I think in terms of project-based rental assistance, multifamily is making some progress. They are at least--they have a plan in place they are talking to OMB about. We haven't seen it, so we can't judge the methodology. We don't know if it is going to be sound or not. And I believe they are going to be doing manual collection of the information. That is challenging. In terms of PIH and tenant-based rental assistance, they are going to invest their time they have told us in getting their IT in place, which will certainly help them collect. It is an ongoing conversation they are having with the Department, and it is absolutely a challenge. And the biggest issue is if they can't do this, they can't put corrective action in place. And if you look at this through the lens of fraud risk management as well, they could be protecting the funds better on the front end and they could be estimating the improper payments on the back end much better. So yes. Mr. Valadao. I am running out of time here, so I appreciate that. And hopefully, I will have more time to talk a little bit about this, because getting that data is obviously vital. So thank you. Mr. Womack. Thank you, Mr. Valadao. Mr. Gonzales. Mr. Gonzales. Thank you, Chairman, for holding this. I am actually very frustrated with HUD right now for a couple different reasons. My question to you, Ms. Davis, is, when was the last time you visited San Antonio? Ms. Oliver Davis. I was just in Houston, but I have not been to San Antonio yet. Mr. Gonzales. I love Houston. Houston is not San Antonio. Ms. Oliver Davis. No. Mr. Gonzales. San Antonio is the seventh largest city in the United States. I am Hispanic. It is predominantly Hispanic. We are having a growing issue with housing. On May 1st, the Secretary came before this committee, and I asked to host her in San Antonio. She agreed to that, and I have yet to hear anything from them. I mention this because a lot of these issues that we talk about are very prevalent in San Antonio. Once again, we are not talking small little off the beaten path. Everyone goes other places. They do not come to San Antonio. Also, you know, I would love to host--I am not trying to be confrontational here. I am trying to highlight the issues that I am seeing in my community--I represent about 40 percent of Bexar County--and bring to light on how we can fix some of these very long-term systemic issues. You are talking tens of thousands of people that are on the HUD waiting list. You are talking about very old infrastructure. I am willing to help out, you know, from being on the Appropriations Committee and this piece to it, but there has to be a partnership. And I am not seeing a partnership here, and I do not understand why. Once again, I hear the administration always talking about equity, equity, equity. Well, guess what? This is an Hispanic community that needs help. My first question is to Mr. Soskin, and this is about Del Rio International Airport. Earlier this year, I supported the FAA reauthorization package, which addressed critical needs across our aviation infrastructure and safety programs. I would like to raise with you Section 570, which requires a report examining and providing recommendations for restoring small community air service. I have worked with the City of Del Rio to ensure Del Rio International Airport is given full consideration as a potential community to be included in this report. IG, can you speak to whether FAA is on track to implement Section 570? Mr. Soskin. Representative Gonzales, we haven't done any work yet related to Section 570 of the Reauthorization Act. With regard to Del Rio's incorporation among the seven airports in that provision, three of which I think are specified in the legislation, I encourage you to reach out to the OST and FAA regarding their decision-making on that. Mr. Gonzales. Once again, another frustration I have, Del Rio, Texas, is home to Laughlin Air Force Base. Every Air Force pilot in the U.S. Air Force gets trained at Laughlin Air Force Base. And when we don't have airport services to this small community, small but yet important, guess what? Our military readiness falls further behind. Eagle Pass, Texas, is in the Del Rio Sector of the Border Patrol sector there, one of the hottest, most contentious parts of the country during this border crisis. When CBP, Customs and Border Protection, do not have access to fly into that airport, it hurts our national security. I bring these things up, because, you know, whether it is a small little town, like Del Rio, which ain't that small, or whether it is a big old city like San Antonio, I am very frustrated with the level of engagement. I am trying to engage here. I am trying to figure out how we solve some of these problems. Leaving these small little towns out to dry not only hurts those small towns, it undermines our national security in many different cases. And, with that, Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Womack. Mrs. Watson Coleman, 5 minutes. Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I apologize. I had another obligation this morning, so I missed testimony, but I do have questions. So this is for you, Inspector General Davis. Oliver Davis, is it? Ms. Oliver Davis. Davis is fine. Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you. My understanding is that we have heard your testimony regarding an account of a property owner falsely affirming that he had no knowledge of lead-based paint, or lead-based paint hazards in the housing. In New Jersey, our children are living--you know that--in housing that was built before 1950 and, most likely, are at highest risk for elevated blood lead due to the potential presence of lead paint. I am concerned about property owners in my State who would falsely affirm their records. So can you describe what resources HUD needs to better audit these inspections, and if there is more that you need than what you have? Ms. Oliver Davis. Well, thank you for drawing our attention to the lead-based paint problem. And you mentioned the age of housing. That is absolutely a top risk factor. And we have looked at this program--I mean, this problem at the program level. We have looked at PHAs and how they are handling lead- based paint. We found that HUD doesn't have even the basic information as far as the number of units that are facing lead- based paint. They are not tracking elevated blood levels appropriately. They have a tracker that has been moved to a new platform, which is a good development, but there are still variances to that tracker. So they have to know about the problem in order to react to it. We are seeing at the grantee level a lot of lack of communication between PHAs and reporting elevated blood levels to the departments, the local health departments, or to HUD. That communication has to happen in full in order for environmental investigations to happen, or for there to be some kind of remedy. In terms of needs, it is a remarkable problem in terms of HUD's oversight. They have tens of thousands of program partners that carry out there housing assistance programs, rental assistance programs, and they all are accountable for lead. And we see a real struggle with accountability there and a real struggle with oversight at the Department level. In terms of our needs, you know, this again fits squarely in my Environmental Justice Initiative, which I am committing resources to. I have a whole audit team devoted to it, and I have special agents and 1811s that are out there on the streets looking for bad actors in this area. We could always do more with more. We are scratching the surface in terms of lead and in terms of unit conditions in HUD housing. We would love to be getting out all over the country and looking at these risks. Mrs. Watson Coleman. So HUD actually provides resources to local entities that should be following up on this at their level, right? Ms. Oliver Davis. Well, we are talking basically about, you know, the grantees, the PHAs and their contractors and their management companies. All that money, of course, flows through the Department. And then the accountability should be from the Department. They should be holding them accountable. Mrs. Watson Coleman. What about inspectors? What about local housing inspectors and health inspectors? Do they have a role in this? Ms. Oliver Davis. Yes. They are part of it. I mean, certainly we have seen REAC inspectors have gone in. And we have NSPIRE. Of course, that is emerging. All of that involves inspections. Mrs. Watson Coleman. So does HUD give resources to these local entities to carry that out? Ms. Oliver Davis. Yes, I believe. I don't know if the money would flow directly to the inspectors from HUD or if it would go through the PHAs and the landlords. I would need to follow up on that with you, but it is all a part of an accountability issue, yes. And I have to acknowledge a capacity issue as well. You know, there are 3,000 PHAs out there alone, not to mention all the landlords. That is a remarkable lift. Mrs. Watson Coleman. It is. But it is really important that our children are not exposed to the lead---- Ms. Oliver Davis. Oh, absolutely. Mrs. Watson Coleman. And we need to figure it out. I can't believe I have 29 seconds. So let me just--I wanted to ask Mr. Soskin, you are responsible for the oversight of the implementation of the Infrastructure Program, right? Does that include oversight into who is getting contracts, that the President's goal for the utilization of MBEs and women-owned businesses and others are being included? Mr. Soskin. Yes. And in particular, our investigators have carried out numerous investigations with successful outcomes of people who misrepresent themselves as eligible to participate in women-owned and disadvantaged business and small business, veteran-owned business programs. Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I will have questions if we have a second round, if we have a second round. Mr. Womack. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am, of course. Mr. Diaz-Balart, 5 minutes. Mr. Diaz-Balart. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. And to all of you, the work that you and your teams do is so hugely important. So thank you. Thank you for your service. A couple questions if I may, Mr. Chairman. General Soskin, Mr. Soskin, Inspector General Soskin, your office released an audit report on June of 2023 regarding fraud risk assessment processes for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. There, your auditors found that--and I am going to kind of quote it here. Without expanding its fraud risk assessment process, quote, ``DOT may not be optimally positioned to comprehensively identify, properly assess, and appropriately prioritize resources to address the full spectrum of fraud risk across all of its programs.'' I know that DOT concurred with your two recommendations, but yet, about a year and a half later, neither requirement-- again, requirements of assessment nor mitigating fraud, to my understanding, has been closed. A couple questions on that: How would meeting these two recommendations help ensure that funds spent in that program, you know, the surface transportation projects, are spent appropriately and as intended? And two, have you got any indication that there is a plan to complete these recommendations? Is it a high priority for the Department? What is your view on those? Mr. Soskin. Well, thank you for your attention to that audit, which is the product of excellent and painstaking work by a number of our auditors. Mr. Diaz-Balart. And deals with a lot of money. Mr. Soskin. And it deals with a lot of money. So we did make the two recommendations that you are asking about. And the first of them is really important, because what we recommended essentially is that people who are knowledgeable about each of these programs or the program areas for something that is a new program under the IIJA, those people should be engaged in the process of thinking about the program and its design, thinking about how bad actors might exploit the program or seek to exploit it. And then, based on a risk assessment that involves the size of the program, its maturity, and the types of risks that those knowledgeable people have identified, the operating administration should determine how much in terms of resources to dedicate to ameliorating those fraud risks and how best to protect against them. I mean, it is really no different than a physical security assessment we might do on a building or a cybersecurity risk assessment. And our second recommendation there is essentially that, while we have operating administrations, such as the Federal Transit Administration, the Highways Administration, the Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the Department, as a whole, at the DOT level, should help across the operating administrations, help them be consistent in their approaches. Mr. Diaz-Balart. How much are you seeing--because, again, my understanding is it has not all been implemented. Is this a priority? I mean, I know it is your priority. You all have done the work, but from the Department? Mr. Soskin. So relevantly, last month the Department circulated a draft order within the Department, and that draft order would, when implemented, establish policy and guidance Department-wide, specifically on fraud risk assessment. Mr. Diaz-Balart. Great. Mr. Soskin. We expect that process to be completed by the end of calendar year 2024, with the new order going into effect and implementation shortly thereafter. Mr. Diaz-Balart. So I guess better late than never, but at least I guess there is some light at the end of this tunnel, correct? Mr. Soskin. We certainly appreciate the Department's actions. Mr. Diaz-Balart. And we would love if you would just kind of keep us in the loop as much as possible just to let us know how that is going. Mr. Soskin. Absolutely. Mr. Diaz-Balart. Some question, Mr. Chairman, which I don't necessarily expect an answer today, but let me--I don't know if this is for you, sir, or for maybe Mr. Winters. So in the so- called bipartisan infrastructure bill, you know, that was about $660 billion to DOT over five years, but there is $27 billion specifically for programs to reduce emissions. $27 billion. Now, do we know--do you know, because every time we spend money, we are supposed to get something for it, right? Do we know--the goal of that is to reduce emissions to lower the temperature of the planet. We know that is the goal. So do we know how much that will reduce--how much--how many degrees, parts of degrees that will lower the temperature and by when? Mr. Soskin. Representative Diaz-Balart, our office has not done any work into looking at the potential impacts of emissions reductions. Mr. Diaz-Balart. And that is fair. The problem, Mr. Chairman, is that we keep spending all this money, taxpayer money on--supposedly to, you know, to stop global warming, and yet I have yet--I am not blaming you all, by the way, I have yet to get one answer from those either pushing it or those trying to implement it as to how much it will actually cool the planet. And it seems that if we are spending billions upon billions of dollars, we should know what we are getting for it. And I have yet to get that answer, and I will continue to pursue it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Womack. Thank you. And you are asking lawyers for that. They are not scientists. I guess they would argue. Mr. Ciscomani, five minutes. Mr. Ciscomani. Well, thank you, Chairman, and thank you, Inspector General Soskin and Inspector General Oliver Davis and Mr. Winters here for testifying before our committee today. Inspector General Soskin, since the COVID-19 pandemic, we have noticed a disturbing uptick in large scale theft due to organized crime in both the trucking and freight trail industries so much so that the second leading category of insurance claims for freight rail is theft-related--theft- related claims. This issue poses a major threat to the supply chain, especially for a state like mine in Arizona where we depend heavily on this. Has this issue come to the attention of your office and what is being done to address it? Mr. Soskin. Representative Ciscomani, this has absolutely been an area that has come to our attention. In the last five years we have had 29 complaints that our investigators have opened on cargo theft and related brokering topics, and most of those complaints have, in fact, been in this last year consistent with the uptick in attention and incidents that you are describing. Cargo theft and abuse of brokering systems is an issue of incredibly important relevance to the motor carrier industry, especially to independent owner operators that depend on brokering services where they may not have direct insight into who is transporting those loads, and we have engaged with leadership at the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and our law enforcement partners, including with prosecutors at the Department of Justice, to be able to bring cases in this area and hopefully to deter wrongdoers in the future. Mr. Ciscomani. What kind of progress have you seen on that due to your efforts? And I appreciate the efforts on this. Arizona is obviously a state, like I said, that depends heavily on this. We are competing also for the international trade, and for Arizona that is a 17 plus billion dollar relationship that we have with the Country of Mexico alone in terms of two-way trade and imports and exports. When safety is an issue for cargo, that can be impacted. It impacts the economy. No question it impacts the safety of those involved as well. So I am very interested not only in the efforts but in the result of those efforts. This has been an ongoing issue, like I said, since the pandemic. It heightened--it had always been an issue, but now it is to the point that it is being brought to my attention by practically everybody on the table involved in this issue, so what kind of progress have you seen on there and how do we, you know, curve the other direction here? Because it is not trending in the right direction still. Mr. Soskin. I wish that I could brief you on the progress of ongoing investigations. Of course, that is not something that I can do, but we would be happy to---- Mr. Ciscomani. I am not asking for that. I am asking have we seen a decrease in any area? All the numbers that I see is a continual increase in theft, and like I said, insurance claims. Have you seen your efforts pose success to the point that we are seeing to reverse the tend where this is going? That is the nature of my question. Mr. Soskin. I don't think we are at the point of reversing that trend yet. Mr. Ciscomani. When do you expect something to happen so I can answer to my constituents and say help is on the way, this is being done and we have seen some progress in this area? Mr. Soskin. We look forward to hopefully being able to announce indictments and then convictions for you to showcase. Mr. Ciscomani. I think that is very important. I think when people start seeing that this is being penalized heavily and is being prosecuted and is actually being convicted, then that will deter behavior of individuals considering engaging in this kind of activity, so I look forward to working with you on this. As you can see, it is very important to my state and it is very important to my district, so I want to be a partner to you all and help not only with the process and whatever it is that is needed, but also in highlighting what is being done there. I will move over to another quick question here. In terms of--General Oliver Davis, for you--the lack of affordable housing supply is also of particular interest in my district in southern Arizona and America overall, but we are facing an unprecedented housing supply shortage. I believe that HUD should partner with private sector to address this issue. My legislation, the Super Demonstration Act, proposes a pilot program through HUD that will streamline the construction of affordable housing through investment and the elimination of certain regulatory requirements. Does your office have any recommendations for HUD to partner with the private sector on this and does HUD have any existing collaborations with the private sector that would also be good for performing? Ms. Oliver Davis. May I answer? Mr. Womack. Yes. Ms. Oliver Davis. Thank you for the question about affordable housing. You know, we see that struggle throughout HUD's portfolio, everything from maintaining what they have in place to the fact that something like project bank rental assistance is limited to a certain number of contracts that HUD can't extend, so we always look to see what initiatives they have going to extend housing. Certainly RAD, certainly rental assistance is something we are very interested in. You have mentioned your legislation. I would be happy to meet with you and discuss that. Happy to offer technical assistance in that way because it is a very challenging thing throughout the portfolio. Of course, we are looking at any grants that flow through the department that will increase the housing supply and looking at those outcomes and looking how to improve that performance. So I think there is certainly existing collaborations in place, but I am always available to talk more about what you have in mind. Mr. Ciscomani. I would love to chat more about that. I do think it is very important, so thank you for being on the right track on that. Mr. Chairman, I yield. Mr. Womack. Mr. Cline, 5 minutes. Mr. Cline. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Inspector General Davis, good to see you. In your testimony you provided several examples of harassment cases you have been able to investigate and refer to the Department of Justice, including a case in Virginia. You answered some of Mr. Valadao's questions about that. Would you mind explaining to the committee the process from opening a case to referring it to the DOJ. Ms. Oliver Davis. Sure. It is--my colleagues and I all experience this, and having been at DOJ myself, I know how this works, but it can work a number of ways. In this case, you know, we are listening for complaints, listening for whistleblowers, individuals that are coming forward to tell us about bad actors and wrongdoing, and sometimes we take that directly to DOJ and see if they are interested. Sometimes we look it up and then take it to DOJ, but we partner with them and they ultimately make a decision about what is brought in court and who will be--who charges will be brought against. Mr. Cline. In the Newport News case that you highlighted, you mentioned incidents of the landlord improperly collecting COVID-19 relief funds. Can you explain the steps either the IG or DOJ takes to recoup improper payments like seen in this case. Ms. Oliver Davis. Well, in this case, and it is ongoing, although we have--we do have a guilty plea in that matter, and that was in a first--a case of first impression for us in that it was criminal racial interference with housing. In terms of recouping funds, you know, looking at prior cases like Centanni that we had in New Jersey, you know, there was a fund available at the end. There was a monetary penalty, and that went--almost all of it, I think we had a $4.5 million penalty in that case, and 4.3, as I said, went directly to victims. So there are some great outcomes. And also a part of that agreement was getting the bad actor out of the programs, having to divest--the individual having to divest himself of ownership of the properties. Mr. Cline. What is the greatest barrier that your office faces when it comes to investigating cases of fraud, waste, and abuse? Ms. Oliver Davis. Oh, gosh. I would say resources. There is a tremendous portfolio on HUD. You know, I was--I have--my staff tells me all the time about the numbers. You know, some of our grantees have seen, you know, 2,000, sometimes 3,000 percent increase in the funds that are flowing through them. We had 15,000 hotline complaints last year. I have 520, 530 people at any given time and about half of those have law enforcement authority. So we are challenged certainly by our own resources, so we have to make very strategic decisions about what we are going to pursue. I feel very good about what we are doing right now, but there is enough fraud to go around always at any given time, and enough bad actors, unfortunately. Mr. Cline. Thank you. Inspector General Soskin, I-81, which runs through my district, is one of the most used interstates in the country for passenger and commercial vehicles. According to VDOT, more than 2,000 motor vehicle incidents take place on I-81 in Virginia every year. To address this, Virginia implemented highway safety corridor programs in 2003 back when I was in the state legislature. Does your office look at state plans like Virginia's highway safety corridor program to see if it could be mimicked or somehow enhanced as a national plan under USDOT? Mr. Soskin. Well, Representative Cline, let me first say that Interstate 81 is one of my favorite Virginia interstates to drive along, notwithstanding the traffic and occasional safety challenges out there. We haven't had the opportunity to do any work that looks specifically at state programs or specifically the Virginia I-81 corridor program. Each state, you know, not only takes its formula fund grants and creates its own often bespoke programs to make use of those funds, but they often pair that with state funding as well. That said, about $100 million of the funding for the I-81 corridor program is through a TIFIA grant, and we did--I suppose it is a TIFIA loan guarantee. We did an audit a few years ago looking at the Department's oversight of TIFIA. In addition, we have a recent audit looking at the Department's oversight of state transportation improvement programs, the STIPs that they are required to complete to establish eligibility for Federal grant funds. Mr. Cline. Okay. One of the amendments that I submitted this year didn't make it in the bill regarded DOT creating a standard for marijuana impairment. I am noticing that DOT has released an anti-impaired driving campaign that promotes the use of marijuana as long as you are not driving. So it says blaze your own path, just don't drive high. Can you talk about the thought behind this campaign and whether the administration thinks it is wise to advocate that taxpayer dollars be used to promote drug use? Mr. Soskin. Representative Cline, we will be happy to take a look at that. That is the first that this campaign has been brought to my attention. I have taken the opportunity of NHTSA's programs on many occasions to encourage our staff to refrain from any dangerous driving activities as well as any violations of the law, including our drug laws. Mr. Cline. Thank you. Yield back. Mr. Womack. We have got time for another round if members will respect the time of our witnesses and can be pretty quick about it. I want to go back to improper payments. You issued a management alert back in January. As you said in your testimony, there is $1.7 billion. I think that estimate was back in 2016. That is quite a long time ago. When we had Acting Secretary Todman in, she specifically said given the deadline for coming back with a plan, monitoring plan, that it would be done by the end of the year. Her words. Based on what you have seen, will HUD be able to meet the deadline? And what, if any, steps have been taken so far? Ms. Oliver Davis. I am not necessarily optimistic that they are going to meet that deadline. Mr. Womack. Are you pessimistic? I will take that as a yes. Ms. Oliver Davis. We are talking to the department about this constantly and collaborating, and we are certainly here to help. I believe the collection of data is something the department has struggled with and we have one housing program doing it manually. Another trying to improve their IT situation so they can perhaps take the information on, secure the PII through their technology. We also have questions and have had ongoing questions for quite some time about the methodology. We haven't seen the methodology yet for the multifamily side of the house, and PIH, if they are working on the technology can't be working on the methodology. So I am not confident we will see that by the end of the year, but if we do, I will be excited to review it. My team will take a look at it. It is certainly an opportunity for the department right now. Mr. Womack. You know, we are hearing a lot about AI and its ability for us to be able to do some predictive analysis and make some better judgmental decisions based on this artificial intelligence phenomenon. Is that a solution here? Is that something that is being implemented? I know I am asking an IG for something pretty technical, but should--surely there is a way for us to be able to do a better job of tracking. Ms. Oliver Davis. I appreciate that suggestion. That is something I will certainly take back to my team. And I know that the department certainly has an AI initiative. The CFO is in charge of that. We consult with him ongoing about it. You know, in the past we have seen the department take on robotics, robotics automation. I don't know if that can be implemented here or not. We have pointed out some problems in the past, but I think we want to give the department some room to try things out, to, you know, do some experimenting, if you will, in the realm of AI. So we are having those discussions, but I would be glad to take that idea back. Mr. Womack. Thank you. General Winters, we still recognize that you are here. We are not purposely leaving you out of the discussion, so I want to come back to you--Acela, the overhaul of the Acela program. You released an audit last September. This $2.3 billion overhaul of the northeast corridor's 20-year- old Acela fleet. It was initiated in 2014. Service launch planned for 2021. Today these trains are still not in service. Help me sort this out. Mr. Winters. I will attempt to. Acela really revealed a gap in Amtrak's management. On one hand, if you recall in my testimony, Amtrak has a very daunting task of running a railroad, 24/7 operations, about 30 some million passengers this year, 500 destinations, weather. That is difficult in and of itself. And they had that capability down pretty well. There is gaps, of course, and things that go wrong, but their ability to deliver capital programs such as Acela has been something we have been critical of for over ten years in various things like Moynihan Train Hall, the Unified Operations Centers as we point out that there are fundamentals that are missed in getting these things done on time and on budget. Acela seems to be in the forefront of that. Until recently, there wasn't an organization within Amtrak's management that was dedicated to these high-visibility, high-dollar programs to deliver them on time and budget. And back when you said in 2014, there was no entity within Amtrak that was dedicated to this practice as it is today. So now in 2022, Amtrak, sensing that they would get some real money to address their undercapitalized assets, dedicated a section called the Capital Delivery department to do just this. These are acquisition professionals like we experience in military programs that know how to run programs, track costs, set business cases, budgets, and accountability going forward. That didn't occur when Acela first was launched. It used to be named Acela 2021. That has kind of come and gone. Now it is New Acela. So where we are now is they have--they have contracted for 28 train sets. Fourteen of them have been built by the contractor Alstom. The problem, however---- Mr. Womack. In 8 years? Mr. Winters. Yes. So the problem, Mr. Chairman, though, is that there is still not an approved computer model by the FRA that would allow these trains, the prototype to go into testing. Accordingly, there is risk there that the ones that are already built and sitting in various train yards will have to be retrofitted. Mr. Womack. I think the taxpayers are in hope that as Amtrak embarks on one of the largest rolling stock purchases in history that these lessons learned help us do a better job. Mr. Winters. That is a very important point. One of the recommendations we made in that audit is that Amtrak have a repository for just that, for lessons learned in these major acquisitions. They have done that. And in fact, the long distance teams, the ones who are doing the very large acquisitions are relying on the lessons learned from New Acela. Mr. Womack. Mike. Mr. Quigley. Thank you, Chair. Thank you all again for being here. I am the vice chair of the quiet skies caucus. Airport noise, a critical issue not just for me but for many of my colleagues. It is not just nuisance. This is Harvard and Boston University studies found that aircraft noise faces-- those addressing it face increased risk of being hospitalized for cardiovascular disease. FAA, a long and spotted issue of--history of addressing this, but they have done some work to survey communities, request input on aviation, noise research, but little has materialized. The noise studies in the past were delayed. Results not necessarily particularly valuable and questionable as to how they went forward. General Soskin, can you give us an update in terms of your assessment of this and how they have done and where we are now after all these years. Mr. Soskin. Ranking Member Quigley, although we haven't done any recent work specific to FAA's handling of noise complaints, we have carried out related audits. One of them looked at the $2.2 billion that FAA has provided since 2005 for land acquisition, including for projects to mitigate noise levels created by airport operations, and we noted that in many cases the noise exposure maps are out of date, that many airports do not have up-to-date inventories of that noise land, and that FAA's monitoring of how the noise land is disposed of and how revenues from disposal are put to use in particular perhaps to undertake other noise amelioration activities that their monitoring of that is incomplete. I would note, and this is small consolation to those of your constituents who are--or others in the caucus who are-- experiencing noise issues now, that there has been a substantial drop over the last few decades in the number of Americans who were exposed to aircraft noise under the FAA's measures. By one statistic cited in one of our audits or maybe GAO's work on the area, it has gone from about 7 million 40 years ago to just over 400,000 today. But some of those who continue to be exposed are exposed more frequently because of greater frequency of---- Mr. Quigley. I would suggest the 400,000 are all in my district. Whatever progress we might have made is largely because of the airlines buying quieter planes, but you must be aware of the studies that were done, you know, trying to address what was clearly an arbitrary assessment of what was tolerable, right? And those studies we still don't have clear answers on, and there were questions about the methodology there and whether that was accurate putting off now for years whatever progress that we would like to make on this issue. Are you aware of these shortcomings that we have faced as well? Mr. Soskin. I am not familiar with the specific studies that you are referring to, but I would be happy to give them a read and discuss them and the issue with you further. Mr. Quigley. I mean, there was a 2023 report your office issued that identified another point, nine recommendations for the FAA to strengthen its oversight of AIP grants for noise, so if at some point you can give us a detailed update on what work you have done to address these recommendations and how the FAA is working to do better on this. Mr. Soskin. All of them are currently open. The target action dates are the end of this year, and we would be happy to provide you with a further update once those recommendations are acted on. Mr. Quigley. Please do. And General, I do--we know you must be doing such a great job. We have fewer questions for you, but I do want to ask one. In February your office initiated an audit of how Amtrak is dealing with customer service, the experience for passengers with disabilities. Can you give us a little bit of info of why that was initiated, what prompted it, and how well you are working with Amtrak on it? Mr. Winters. We are very committed to enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act and making sure that all Americans have access to transportation. And so our customer service job focuses on those tenets that we think are important in terms of making sure transportation is available to all Americans. Mr. Womack. Mr. Rutherford, bring us home. Mr. Rutherford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Davis, first I want to thank you all for your focus on HUD safety and our abilities, but I do want to bring up Eureka Gardens you may be familiar with. We had a HUD-assisted property there which was plagued by health and safety issues. Finally resulted in a gas leak that had an explosion. In your written testimony, you mentioned HUD lacked a standard protocol for its offices to ensure life-threatening deficiencies are addressed at HUD-supported housing units after a REAC inspection. How can that possibly be? When you are dealing with life threatening findings, are they not speaking to local code enforcement? This is--well, first let me ask you this, because that was May of last year. Do we have a protocol now? Ms. Oliver Davis. We have made that recommendation. You did a great job of addressing that part of our portfolio. Mr. Rutherford. Is that a no? Ms. Oliver Davis. Much of that work is based on the tragic circumstances that you are talking about. We are--they are working towards--HUD is working towards migrating to a central location and a way of dealing with these multifamily complaints, because as you said, our work---- Mr. Rutherford. What you are telling me is right now it is a no. Ms. Oliver Davis. My understanding is we don't have that yet and my understanding is it could be dependent on funding is what I am learning. It is something we continue to push on. It is a priority recommendation for us. Mr. Rutherford. You know, sometimes--you know, even you mentioned the numbers that your people are dealing with. Sometimes I wonder if HUD has just gotten--do you think HUD has just gotten too big? Ms. Oliver Davis. I think--in terms of too big or too small, I don't know. I look at--I have to look obviously at what is in front of us and whether or not there can be accountability in these programs. I do think we have a struggle with capacity at the department. That is something that we have tried very hard to reflect in our Top Management Challenges report. We see it throughout the portfolio. HUD's decentralized. Things flow through the department out to the program partners and out into your communities where your constituents are, and there is risk involved in that. And there has to be accountability, and we do see a struggle with that, yes. Mr. Rutherford. Right. So is REAC, do they--after an inspection, do they actually present any of those findings to structural issues, gas leaks? Do they present those things to a local code enforcement? Ms. Oliver Davis. I confess I don't know the interaction between local code enforcement and REAC. You know, we all know REAC has struggled. We have all--I think I probably speak for all of us, we have been happy to see a reassessment of REAC and the idea of NSPIRE being introduced. Conceptually, I think NSPIRE has some great concepts and things that we hope to see implemented and carried out. Because that was--NSPIRE, one of the things they are trying to do is put a greater emphasis on the unit conditions and the health and safety of the tenants. Mr. Rutherford. The health and safety issues, I mean, that ought to be paramount. And I will close with this, because it is 11:30. Do we have--do you know, does HUD have the capacity to do 100 percent? And if not 100 percent, what percent are they able to do REAC inspections on properties across the country? Ms. Oliver Davis. Well, as we know, REAC has been traditionally a sample of properties, and that is why the additional requirement that landlords do a self-inspection every year has been so important. We have yet to see how NSPIRE will address this. The compliance date, I believe, is October 2025 for compliance with NSPIRE. I look forward to seeing how that is implemented and to see if we see any changes. Mr. Rutherford. Okay. Ms. Oliver Davis. Capacity is a struggle. It is absolutely a struggle. Mr. Rutherford. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Womack. Thank you. Now bringing us home is Ms. Watson Coleman. Sorry. I missed you earlier. Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you, Chairman. Ms. Davis, when Marcia Fudge was the undersecretary, she wanted to make sure that more disadvantaged businesses and community-based businesses got 50 percent or 51 percent of the work in areas where they are resettling properties, changing, and things of that nature. Do you have any idea where we are in that? Ms. Oliver Davis. I feel like I am omitting a fact that I can't recall, to be honest. Mrs. Watson Coleman. CDBG funds. Ms. Oliver Davis. I don't recall. That is something I would be happy to get back to you on. Mrs. Watson Coleman. Okay. That may be a capacity issue also. Mr. Winters, I am going to ask you a question about this summer and the shutdown that we had that affected the northeast corridor. Was that all about equipment that failed? Was that Amtrak's equipment that failed? Was that some other? Mr. Winters. We haven't specifically examined those delays, but we are very aware of them. It is our understanding it is a combination of factors that caused it. One of them, by the way, was excessive heat. And it involves technologies and interoperability between two railroads, New Jersey Transit and also Amtrak's. While I am not a catenary engineer, it has to do with electrification of the trains from the pantographs and the catenaries, the wires that are above the trains, and there were some, we believe, interoperability issues. Mrs. Watson Coleman. Have you all had any opportunity to assess the financial impact that has had on Amtrak? Mr. Winters. We have not assessed that, but that is in our audit cue to perhaps look at. Mrs. Watson Coleman. Okay. Thank you. Mr. Soskin, I still am on this question about MBE, WBE, and other sort of underutilized businesses having access to contracts as well as employment on these various projects. I go up and down 95 and I see--I don't see a lot of minorities. What is it that you all are doing to ensure that the measures that were suggested or recommended or asserted by the President are being met? And what is the course correction if they are not being met? And if you can't answer that now, can I have a specific response to it soon? Mr. Soskin. I think much of that is a question for the Department, which is charged with meeting those criteria. I know that from the access that they have provided to us in their meetings for planning, the use of IIJA funds is an issue that they have taken seriously. They have engaged in technical assistance to both grantees and to potential bidders who fall into the categories of disadvantaged businesses. Importantly, when the Department measures its progress on the Justice40 Initiative that the Administration has in some of its areas, Congress has legislated that underserved communities be defined to include rural communities as opposed to ones that fall into demographic categories. Mrs. Watson Coleman. I guess I am asking you, because you have oversight whether or not the department is doing the things that it is supposed to do. So--right? Including this. So yeah. So I just need to know, is the department successful in meeting these goals and objectives? And if not, what is their course correction? Mr. Soskin. We haven't carried out any recent audit work in that area. I haven't seen any information to suggest they are not meeting those goals. Mrs. Watson Coleman. Well, there is a lot of chatter in the various communities that it is not, and I don't want there to be an oops situation where we are--we have completed the program and those businesses that have been traditionally underutilized are not utilized appropriately with this opportunity, so I would appreciate it if you would have someone look into it and get back to me. With that, I yield back. Mr. Womack. Thank you, Ms. Watson Coleman. Mike, any final comments? Mr. Quigley. No, Mr. Chairman. Thank you so much. Good hearing. Mr. Womack. I want to thank our witnesses from Amtrak, DOT, and HUD IGs for being here today. Your testimony is very helpful to this committee. We are trying to get back into some oversight after quite a long period without, so we do appreciate you coming in today and sharing your insights with the committee. And with that, this hearing is now adjourned. Thank you. GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FIRMAT
