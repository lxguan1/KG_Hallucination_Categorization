  OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MORGAN LUTTRELL, A REPRESENTATIVE 
 FROM TEXAS, SUBCOMMITTEE ON CYBER, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES, 
                         AND INNOVATION

    Mr. Luttrell. The subcommittee will come to order. I ask 
unanimous consent that the Chair be authorized to declare a 
recess at any time.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    Good morning, everyone. Thank you for attending. We are 
here today to discuss one of the most critical enablers within 
the U.S. arsenal, and that is software. Software that the 
warfighter uses is crucial to our ability to conduct operations 
in the air, the sea, on land, in space, and obviously in 
cyberspace. Similar to our expectations the aircraft carriers 
will be able to leave our pier and the F-18s can deliver a 
payload over its target. We expect that the systems and code 
that we rely on will work when needed.
    Despite this criticality, we see a Department that 
collectively struggles in procuring, operating, and 
prioritizing software. Congress [does] know when something is 
wrong and something is right or when something is working or 
not working. We see the reports, we read the studies repeatedly 
noting that the Department struggles with software findings 
that are remarkably consistent from the 1980s to today. We know 
that some things are fundamentally amiss.
    My hope today is for the witnesses to not only describe the 
problem but contextualize, where possible, what is being done 
to date and what the largest barriers have been for addressing 
these issues in a truly meaningful manner. I can't think of a 
better set of witnesses in front of us today to help with that 
task than the three that I am about to introduce. Ms. Ellen 
Lord, the former Under Secretary for Defense for Acquisitions 
and Sustainment; Dr. Richard Murray, professor of control and 
dynamic systems and bioengineering at Caltech [California 
Institute of Technology] and co-chair of the 2019 Defense 
Innovation Board's Software Acquisition and Practices study. 
And Dr. Dan Pratt, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. Thank 
you all for being with us today.
    I will now recognize the ranking member for his opening 
remarks.

STATEMENT OF HON. RO KHANNA, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM CALIFORNIA, 
      RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON CYBER, INFORMATION 
                  TECHNOLOGIES, AND INNOVATION

    Mr. Khanna. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you to our 
three excellent witnesses, looking forward to hearing from you.
    The Department of Defense and U.S. Government has been 
critical in the development of software and technology in this 
country. As a Representative of Silicon Valley, I remember that 
it was our mission to the Moon that led to the acquisition of 
semiconductors, and that is what spawned Silicon Valley. Had we 
not had the U.S. Government buy semiconductors in the scale 
they did, you would never have seen the development of Silicon 
Valley and the technology. Now, a lot of the innovation is 
happening in my district and in the private sector. And we need 
to figure out how we continue and strengthen the collaboration 
between our Department of Defense and private sector, 
recognizing the dynamic nature of software, how quickly it 
changes, how much we need that innovation to keep us the 
strongest military and country in the world. So I am looking 
forward to your comments and your suggestions.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Luttrell. Thank you, Mr. Khanna. We will now start with 
the witnesses. Ms. Lord, you are recognized for 5 minutes for 
your opening statement.

  STATEMENT OF HON. ELLEN M. LORD, FORMER UNDER SECRETARY OF 
 DEFENSE FOR ACQUISITION AND SUSTAINMENT, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

    Ms. Lord. Thank you very much, Congressman Luttrell, for 
chairing this hearing and thank you, Mr. Khanna, and members of 
the committee to allow me to come and talk with some of my 
former colleagues and now current colleagues.
    In an era of strategic competition among technologically 
advanced powers, software will shape the nature of deterrence 
and define national security advantage. The urgency to empower 
our defense and national security apparatus across all domains 
with both the best existing and emerging technology is critical 
to not only preserve our freedoms, but also those of our 
partners and allies.
    Our Nation has developed an operationalized technology 
solutions that have transformed our commercial sector, and in 
turn, our everyday lives. Now we must harness and apply this 
ingenuity and innovation to bolster U.S. military superiority 
in the digital age. Given current geopolitical conditions, the 
stakes could not be higher.
    Software development and implementation in support of our 
country's defense and intelligence infrastructure needs to meet 
the challenge of the moment. To fall short now would not just 
be a bureaucratic debacle but a source of imminent risk to our 
ability to deter, fight, and win. The ability to quickly 
develop and deliver capability to close the gap between 
information discovery and mission response is a defining 
differentiator in emerging global competition.
    Defense and intelligence agencies must develop, acquire, 
execute, and maintain software to meet current mission needs, 
while also having the agility to quickly respond to future 
threat environments. The statutory, regulatory, and budgetary 
framework for these agencies are ripe for streamlining, to 
build and maintain the Nation's software advantage.
    The Department of Defense procurement process is one of the 
greatest challenges and opportunities to software acquisition. 
Often, software's purchased using the same approach that is 
traditionally employed for major hardware systems purchases. 
Typically, this entails setting rigid requirements, conducting 
lengthy solicitation processes, and ultimately, years later, 
facing costly sustainment contracts to adapt software that is 
often obsolete upon delivery. Although alternative acquisition 
pathways exist, they are only as effective as an acquisition 
professional's ability to implement them.
    Funding professional training and development for 
acquisition professionals to ensure they have key skills for 
implementing the full spectrum of acquisition approaches will 
enable the best and most innovative software and technology to 
be quickly provided for our national security workforce. DOD 
[Department of Defense] must operationalize policies and 
procedures to support the use of modern software development 
and delivery practices, such as agile software development 
lifecycle, software-as-a-service delivery, human centered 
design, DevSecOps [development, security, and operations], and 
modern technology stacks.
    Training the acquisition workforce is necessary but not 
sufficient to modernize software development and deployment. 
Resourcing must be available to provide flexible budgeting, 
rapid and continuous authority to operate, and leadership must 
demand that all relevant authorities, procedures, and processes 
are employed. My submitted testimony goes into more details on 
these items.
    I would like to close by acknowledging three efforts that 
are producing actionable recommendations that might be useful 
to this subcommittee. One is the Commission on Planning, 
Programming, Budgeting, and Execution, who just last week 
produced our final report. Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member 
Smith held a hearing in which we talked about recommendations 
that could be employed; many would help our software 
initiatives.
    Two, the Software [in] Defense Coalition that is led by 
Jane Lee is producing actionable recommendations for the 
subcommittee.
    And finally, the Atlantic Council Commission on Software-
Defined Warfare, on which I serve, is again producing 
actionable recommendations.
    I urge the committee to follow up on these. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Lord can be found in the 
Appendix on page 23.]
    Mr. Luttrell. Thank you, Ms. Lord.
    Dr. Murray, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

   STATEMENT OF RICHARD M. MURRAY, PROFESSOR OF CONTROL AND 
 DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS AND BIOENGINEERING, CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF 
                           TECHNOLOGY

    Dr. Murray. Mr. Luttrell, Mr. Khanna, and distinguished 
members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to speak 
with you this morning on the topic of software development in 
the Department of Defense.
    From 2016 to 2021 I was member of the Defense Innovation 
Board and I co-chaired along with Michael McQuade the DIB study 
on Software Acquisition and [Practices] which we call SWAP. 
This was established in the 2018 NDAA [National Defense 
Authorization Act], and our report was titled ``Software is 
Never Done'' and it was released in May of 2019.
    One of the key findings of our report was that Congress and 
DOD had been talking about the importance of software and 
struggling with how to make better use of software in support 
of national security for decades. In many ways the DIB report 
of 2019 was just a rephrasing of the 1987 Defense Science Board 
task force on military software written 32 years earlier, which 
identified itself over 30 previous studies on that same topic. 
As we described in our report, ``Chapter 3: Been There, Said 
That,'' we know what we need to do, we just need to figure out 
how to actually do it and get to it.
    In our 2019 report we identified three themes that I 
believe are still the most important points to make about 
getting software right. The first is that speed and cycle time 
are the most important metrics for software. Being able to 
develop and deploy faster than our adversaries means that we 
can provide more advanced capabilities, respond to our 
adversaries moves, and be more responsive to end users. Faster 
reduces risk, leads to increased reliability, and gives us a 
tactical advantage on the battlefield by allowing operation and 
response inside our adversaries' OODA loop--observe, orient, 
decide, and act.
    Second, software is made by people and for people so 
digital talent matters. DOD resource policies are often not 
conducive to attracting, retaining, and promoting digital 
talent. Talented software developers and acquisition personnel 
with software experience are often put in jobs that did not 
allow them to make use of those talents, particularly in the 
military, where rotating job assignments may not recognize and 
reward the importance of software development experience.
    Today, in DOD and the industrial base that supports it, the 
people with the necessary skills exist. But instead of taking 
advantage of their skills, we often put them in environments 
where it is difficult for them to be effective.
    Third, software is different than hardware and not all 
software is the same. Over the years, Congress and DOD have 
established a sophisticated set of statutes, regulations, and 
instructions that govern the development, procurement, and 
sustainment of defense systems. But software development is 
fundamentally different than hardware development. And software 
should be developed, deployed, tested, and continuously 
improved using much different cycle time, support, 
infrastructure, and maintenance strategies.
    Software is never done, and must be managed as an enduring 
capability that is treated differently than hardware. In 
preparing for this meeting, I took the opportunity to read 
recent GAO [U.S. Government Accountability Office] reports on 
the implementation of some of the recommendations from the SWAP 
study which we partnered with Ms. Lord on when she was in the 
DOD.
    I was pleased to see that Congress and DOD have made 
substantial progress in implementing many of our 
recommendations, including establishing new acquisition 
pathways for software and exploring new appropriation 
categories that allow software to be funded as a single budget 
item. These are important steps and they should be continued 
and accelerated if we are going to get software right.
    In addition to these important actions that focused on the 
acquisition process, DOD implemented many actions on other 
primary and secondary recommendations from our report. Some of 
the most important are developing guidance on authority to 
operate, ATOs, including ATO reciprocity and continuous ATOs 
which enable continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
    As of April 2023, it appears that guidance for continuous 
ATOs has not yet been published, and I would encourage the DOD 
to do so if it hasn't already.
    Another area of high importance is recruiting digital 
talent. DOD reports progress in establishing software factories 
that combine personnel from specialized teams, but it appears 
they have yet to establish a separate career track for software 
developers, something that we recommended.
    A well-defined career track for software developers, 
including service members, will allow DOD to train and retain 
the skilled workforce necessary to design, build, and test 
modern software systems.
    Finally, an area that is completely different today than it 
was 5 years ago when we did the SWAP study is the role of 
artificial intelligence in military systems. The implications 
of AI will be profound across all areas of society and the 
field is changing so rapidly that it is impossible to predict 
how AI is going to progress over anything more than the next 
few years.
    In the context of software development, AI is poised to 
revolutionize the way we write, test, and deploy code. Modern 
large language models, LLMs, are already writing code based on 
descriptions of the desired function, and are being used in 
industry to speed development. In the future they will be 
integral to testing, deployment, and protection of software as 
well. These developments will democratize software development 
in ways that have a potential to drastically reduce cycle time, 
both for the U.S. and for our adversaries.
    At the same time software that is used for military systems 
is too critical to fail, and so we must find ways to harness 
those tools that fit the increased levels of security and 
safety that are required in safety and mission critical 
systems. DOD must stay on top of these developments and take 
advantage of current U.S. leadership being developed in the 
commercial sector.
    Congress working with DOD plays an essential role in moving 
forward and breaking us out of the cycle of repeating for the 
last 32 years.
    Thank you for your attention. And I look forward to our 
discussion.
    [The prepared statement of Dr. Murray can be found in the 
Appendix on page 37.]
    Mr. Luttrell. Thank you, Dr. Murray.
    Dr. Patt, you are recognized for 5 minutes, sir.

   STATEMENT OF DANIEL PATT, SENIOR FELLOW, HUDSON INSTITUTE

    Dr. Patt. Thank you for inviting me here to speak on such 
an important topic.
    I am here in an individual capacity, but I serve in diverse 
roles offering me perspectives on the cutting edge of national 
security technology and threats, the broad techno-economic 
shifts which are reshaping the global order, and the vibrant 
commercial tech ecosystem.
    As you all know, software is ubiquitous, its powerful 
implications for economic productivity, for government 
effectiveness, for cybersecurity, and the character of national 
security. And these technological changes are overlaid on the 
geopolitical context of our time, strategic competition between 
the United States and the People's Republic of China [PRC]. And 
the crux of the problem for national security is this: In a 
sustained competition, in a long-term competition, advantage 
ultimately depends on the ability of one side to adapt, move by 
move, year by year, mitigating weaknesses and building 
advantage.
    The kinds of questions that we end up with in the military 
dimension of competition are things like are our weapon systems 
relevant against a relentless pace of new threats? Can 
commanders access data to control highly distributed forces? 
Can we invent new ways of fighting that put the PRC on the back 
foot and dissuade aggression?
    These are the issues that the Department of Defense must 
tackle if it wants to compete and now every one of these issues 
now depends on software. Even changing a military unit's 
tactics now depends on a software update, not just a whiteboard 
planning session. And we need look no further than the 
battlefields of Ukraine to find evidence that units which are 
able to change their software more quickly see better outcomes. 
So we face a choice. We can be victims of software, cursing its 
bugs and delays and overruns, or we can harness it for 
competitive advantage by leveraging American ingenuity, a 
robust talent base, and leading technology. That's our 
question, can we create a defense system built for evolution 
and adaptation, a defense system built to compete?
    My central message is this, and it will echo those of my 
fellow witnesses here: The process of getting code from a 
programmer to an operational system is critical. This is what 
is so different about software, we blur the lines between what 
is development, building something, and what is operations, 
using that same thing. So making this quick and robust is a 
necessary condition for competition. And there are a handful of 
forward-leaning trailblazers in the Department doing this well 
today, but they remain in the minority and they face daily 
struggles against organizations and processes built for another 
era.
    So I call your attention to two actionable items for 
oversight. First, enabling rapid software deployment and 
updates through the ATO process, as we have discussed, where 
again ATO refers to the process of how the Department decides 
that software is safe to deploy and use.
    The second item, talent, attracting qualified technical 
expertise to guide DOD's software development and procurement. 
On the first topic, I will introduce an analogy. In many ways 
making software resembles a potter molding wet clay and forming 
it into some finished piece. When an engineering team works 
with source code, it acts like wet clay, they can quickly 
adjust it, make fixes. But once the code is compiled, built, 
shipped, it becomes fixed and brittle. The executable code only 
works on one particular type of processor, as many fixed 
assumptions about those operating conditions. And what we find 
is modern software is so complex and has so many dependencies 
that you need to feed the results back to the engineering team, 
you need a cycle. And unfortunately our ATO process often makes 
this quite difficult. So this is addressed in greater detail in 
my written statements.
    On the second topic, technical talent, software is a 
complex and technical subject matter, details matter, the bits 
matter. So we hear these clickbait headlines sometimes, like 
one simple trick can solve DOD software like use Kubernetes or 
get to the cloud or one software factory to rule them all, or 
just hire Silicon Valley, or it's all about agile. Those are 
all great tools, those are useful things, but navigating that 
complexity requires judgment and organic technical talent on 
the part of the Department.
    The DOD needs a few top tier technical leaders driven by 
mission, it doesn't need armies of CAC [common access card] 
badge coders. And it can attract this talent, if given the 
right tools, using things like term appointments, and giving 
these people autonomy to make a mission impact. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Dr. Patt can be found in the 
Appendix on page 47.]
    Mr. Luttrell. Thank you, Dr. Patt.
    We will move into questioning. I will open up. Authority to 
operate, you all three hit on that. It seems--I hate to say it 
seems almost as--you guys shouldn't leave, I am going to talk 
to you guys if you want to hang out. Yeah, totally cool. Sit 
back down. The authority to operate, I don't necessarily mean--
it seems like it is the improper medium for software innovation 
into the Department because software is updated every half 
second of every second of every minute of every hour of every 
day, correct. I mean, it just moves so fluidly.
    For the past 40 years, the authority to operate seems to be 
a bogging the system down. I am asking three subject matter 
experts, we will start with you Mr. Patt. Or Ms. Lord, we will 
start with you, ladies first. What is the fix? I don't want 
something hanging on the wall that we talked about. I don't 
want a report that we never read. What is the actual fix to fix 
this problem? This is the way that we--forward leaning in front 
of our adversaries and we seem to be bogging--the system is 
failing itself it sounds like. Ms. Lord.
    Ms. Lord. The challenge is the need for speed. And I 
believe there are two things that we need to do, is one, move 
to continuous ATOs. There has been a lot written and a lot 
discussed, but continuous ATOs are not yet implemented. And I 
would suggest that [inaudible] posture hearings, this would be 
a very good thing to ask DOD leadership about.
    Secondly, we are repeatedly across even programs, military 
services, agencies, not allowing reciprocal rights for ATOs, so 
the same software is being reauthorized again and again. Those 
are the two key things that I think you should push on.
    Mr. Luttrell. So breaking down the silos between the 
multiple departments.
    Ms. Lord. Absolutely, and not looking at discrete, 
repetitive approvals. Right now, in fact, there is only a 
requirement to approve 12 systems a year, which given the fact 
that most of our systems run on hardware, software, and data, 
is frightening.
    Mr. Luttrell. Dr. Murray.
    Dr. Murray. Yeah, I would completely agree, I think when 
you think about continuous ATO in particular, right? What do we 
need to be able to do? We need to be able to say this software 
needs to be updated, it needs to be updated now, the longer we 
wait, the more risk we put our warfighters in by not giving 
them the code they need to do the job they need to do.
    So how do we get to the point where we are an industry, 
right, where if a zero day comes out, that is some attack on my 
cell phone, that is going to going to break into my cell phone, 
there will be an update in the next day or two, right? And that 
means they have already figured out how do we put an update out 
there that is not going to break all of those [inaudible], it 
is going to satisfy all of our own security things. We need to 
do that within the DOD. We need to define what that is. I think 
you should be asking on every program what is the cycle time 
that is going into the software? How much of that cycle time is 
the ATO process, right? And if that ATO process, if that is 
more than sort of a day, there is a problem, right, because it 
needs to be a continuous ATO. It needs it be something where we 
automatically check, does this satisfy the security 
requirements? This is important code, we have got to be careful 
about it. But we need to be able to get out there quickly, or 
we're putting our warfighters at risk.
    Mr. Luttrell. Mr. Patt.
    Dr. Patt. I agree very much with those comments. It is 
useful to talk about--the ATO is about the risk of using the 
software, about deploying the software, and this gets aligned 
with mission risk. And sometimes I feel this point gets lost. 
If it's buying body armor you can really separate these 
decisions of did I buy the body armor and does it meet the 
spec, and, you know, is it safe to use this on a mission, does 
this help support the mission. With software though, again, 
these lines get blurred.
    I will say that one of the places where you see progress in 
the Department is where they try to put these risks together, 
so if you look at, in the Navy, PEO IWS [Program Executive 
Office Integrated Warfare Systems], or PMW [Program Manager, 
Warfare] 150. There are program offices and program managers 
which both own the risk of use of the software on the 
operational network, and the development of the software. And 
you move those things together, you tend to get these more 
mission-focused outcomes. These are the organizations which 
have been successfully able to use continuous ATOs. And I would 
expect that, you know, that same characteristic to carry us 
forward. You know, as Dr. Murray said, you know, we often focus 
on ATOs like this old-fashioned boxed software model, and we 
forget the risk of not updating the software, of not deploying 
new features which will make us more successful in our mission.
    And we have become too focused on compliance, checking the 
boxes of, you know, did we meet the boxes that we said we would 
when we shipped that software, and we forget the underlying 
problems of we are trying to conduct a mission here. And the 
most important thing is the cycle time that we keep coming back 
to, so you can keep updating, adding features and mitigating 
problems.
    Ms. Lord. If I may have one quick followup on that.
    Mr. Luttrell. Yes, ma'am.
    Ms. Lord. I think we need to differentiate in the 
Department between risk management and risk elimination. We are 
never going to eliminate all risk and these tradeoffs are what 
take human judgment calls and what Dr. Patt is talking about. 
Also he called out PEO IWS. I think it is very important for 
Congress to recognize those individuals in the Department who 
are leaning forward and demonstrating, embracing authorities, 
policies, procedures. And I would say Admiral Seiko Okano, who 
was, I think, she is just moving along PEO IWS, has done that 
admirably.
    Thank you.
    Mr. Luttrell. Thank you, Ms. Lord.
    For all the young men and women sitting behind the 
witnesses, they are talking to you. You are the next generation 
that will keep this country ahead of nefarious actors across 
the globe. So I highly recommend you play this tape back 
because we are counting on you. Do you understand? Outstanding.
    Mr. Khanna, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Khanna. [Inaudible]
    In my district when you have a software challenge at Apple 
or Google, they don't just go out and buy new software. In 
fact, that is the last thing they do. They have a mission and 
they figure things out.
    I have heard from people who sold to the DOD or worked at 
the DOD that they just buy new software to check off the box 
that they have complied, but this isn't actually innovating in 
the way that the private sector does. Could you comment on how 
we change that culture, other than getting Tim Cook to run 
these things?
    Ms. Lord. I think it comes down to investing in the human 
capital at DOD. If individuals are not trained to be smart 
buyers, and we cannot attract contemporary coders and so forth, 
we will not change that culture. Right now we have a huge issue 
and this is mentioned in our PPBE [Planning, Programming, 
Budgeting, and Execution Reform Commission] final report with 
modernizing a lot of our business systems. We are pretty good 
at talking about innovating from a warfighting technology point 
of view.
    We typically do not talk about innovating business systems. 
We need to digitize those systems. And we have to attract 
individuals who want to work on contemporary COTS [commercial-
off-the-shelf] systems. Right now we have a hard time 
attracting a lot of software specialists in the Department 
because we are working on 10-, 20-, 30-year-old software. And 
frankly, there is not the knowledge of the art of a possible as 
to what could be done. So I suggest working with DAU [Defense 
Acquisition University], training the acquisition professionals 
on what a digital environment really is. Thank you.
    Dr. Murray. I would say that, you know, I completely agree 
with you. We can't sort of say, hey, this software is not doing 
what it is supposed to do so let us go specify and put a bunch 
of requirements into finding a new piece of software that is 
going to do that and go buy that somehow, and 5 years later 
this thing comes along.
    I think what you see in Silicon Valley and other places is 
that we say we need a platform, and that platform is an 
enduring capability. We are going to be doing search forever. 
We are going to be delivering apps to cell phones forever. And 
so, we are going to be tracking satellites and tracking debris 
in space forever. There is an enduring capability there. And 
there is software that is going to do that. And we need to 
think about that platform as something that is going to get 
updated, new features are going to be added and other things. 
And we are not going to say, let's, you know, sort of write 
down the requirements for that, buy it, and then it's done and 
it's going to sit there for 10, 20 years.
    It needs to be something we say every year, we are going to 
invest a certain amount of money in that software and a 
development team that is going to do that. And we need to 
create a system in which we sort of think of software as an 
enduring capability. And get into that that mind-set. It is 
absolutely possible. We have seen it in the commercial sector. 
It is part of the reason that the U.S. commercial sector is so 
far ahead is that we are just able to jump on all of those 
things.
    And so, we have to do that within the DOD. I think there 
are spots that are doing that. We need to again, as Ms. Lord 
said, we need to amplify those, we need to recognize those, we 
need to do that more.
    One other thing I'll say is, you know, I think that we see 
some of that starting in the software acquisition pathway, but 
it's for things that are pure software, so much software is 
sitting on top of hardware and the hardware mind-set dominates 
the software that is part of that hardware. We have got to 
break out of that. That software also needs to be updated.
    If you are looking at an F-22 there is software in that. 
Some of that software should stay there for a decade or more. 
But much of that software is things that should really be 
updated on a regular basis.
    Mr. Khanna. I had one more question, so I will give you the 
chance to answer it. If there is a company and they are awarded 
a second phase SBIR [Small Business Innovation Research] grant, 
a lot of the startups do, then they often are waiting for a 
year, year and a half to get the SBIR III. And this is the 
valley of death in Silicon Valley for a lot of startups. Is 
there a way that you could authorize the contracting officer to 
a least give a letter of intent to possibly give--that they are 
going to get the grant because so many of these startups don't 
make it at the SBIR III phase.
    Dr. Patt. Yeah, so this question on acquisition policy is 
there are a variety of tools that the government can use. 
However, there are also limits. For example, a frequent limit 
that comes up with SBIR III awards is an anti-deficiency thing, 
often you have to wait for funding to become available from a 
future year so that the government can't just indicate advanced 
notice of award.
    Some of the things that the PPBE Commission has done in its 
report, its recommendations, could create additional 
flexibilities which could be delegated down to program managers 
and contract officers, which could allow flexibility, allow in 
the same year flexing of priorities of being able to maybe move 
some money that isn't being put to good purpose to advancing, 
say, an SBIR Phase III award.
    Ms. Lord. Following up on that a little bit, I think it is 
important to note that right now the National Academies is 
running a study on recertification of the SBIR/STTR [Small 
Business Technology Transfer] process for just this very 
reason.
    And as Dan mentioned, we in this PPBE report talked about 
how if we didn't have so many discreet budget line elements, 
but had more capability elements, we could allow the PEOs and 
PMs [Program Managers] to have more agility, especially in the 
year of execution, to move money towards emerging technologies 
and these smaller companies.
    Right now, unfortunately, in my opinion, the SBIR/STTR 
process is an afterthought for most PEOs and PMs. There is not 
a lot of education on it, and it is a little bit trickier to 
use. So again, educating the workforce is critical.
    Mr. Luttrell. Thank you, Mr. Khanna.
    Mr. Gaetz, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Gaetz. March 7 of this year, AviationTimes.com reported 
that the TR-3 [Technology Refresh 3] software delay could force 
the DOD to combat-code F-35s. I don't know what it means to 
combat-code something, sounds dangerous. So maybe, Ms. Lord, we 
could draw on your experience and you could explain what 
combat-coding is and whether that is a good idea?
    Ms. Lord. I am not sure I totally know the definition of 
combat-coding, but it sounds like coding on the go. I will say 
the F-35 is the perfect example of a program that looked to our 
major primes who are absolutely critical for our national 
security, but frankly to a large degree has excluded the small 
companies where the predominance of innovation in this country 
takes place. And that is where the coding capability is. And I 
think having lived through the TR-3 drama, if you will, we need 
to decompose this and make sure when we are awarding these 
large contracts that we are reaching out to the companies who 
know how to do this coding, and again, manage risk, don't 
eliminate risk, and find a way to bring them in.
    Mr. Gaetz. So here is our challenge that we have with a lot 
of these companies. They are dying to get the contract, they do 
all sorts of things to get these big old contracts, to get 
these, you know, $180 million-a-copy F-35s. And then they want 
to protect their source code, and not allow other innovators to 
be able to be able to access it to kind of springboard and 
innovate off of it.
    Dr. Murray, is the F-35 one of these kind of hardware 
dominated paradigm systems where the upgrades that are needed 
for the warfighter are now being executed through this combat-
coding system.
    Dr. Murray. I don't know whether or not the combat-coding 
system is being used there, but, you know, it is certainly the 
case that it is a large hardware program that has used, from 
what I can tell, a very traditional DOD process to decide----
    Mr. Gaetz. And you mean that as a critique?
    Dr. Murray. Yes, as a critique. I agree. And the software 
components of that again, some software components, the 
embedded flight control code is not something you should be 
changing every day. Other parts that are doing the logistics 
change and other things are things that we want to be agile 
about and we want to take advantage of. And so, how do we, in 
those programs, say, not that we should break the rules because 
now there is a crisis and so we are going to do it differently, 
but rather, we have a well-defined way of putting software in 
there, checking, doing continuous ATOs. Part of our process is 
we know what is the frequency at which we are going to update 
the different pieces of software. I think when you look at----
    Mr. Gaetz. And what they love to say to us is, oh, you need 
to update it frequently, and we need to be sole source. And of 
course, we can't share our source code with anyone else so that 
they might be able to participate in that update. So how do I 
break through that?
    Dr. Murray. I think it is great question, you know, and I 
will let Dan say a little bit about it, you know. I do think 
that you have to think about where the pieces of software are 
going to come from, and they don't all have to come necessarily 
from one manufacturer.
    Mr. Gaetz. Oh, we will have to wake Lockheed Martin up with 
smelling salts, that not every update to the F-35 has to come 
through Lockheed Martin.
    Dr. Patt. So first, let me just add some operational 
context to this. Sometimes I think that in peacetime it is hard 
to understand how important delivering software updates is. But 
if you just look at the conflict playing out in the Ukraine, 
one of the things is you see Ukrainian radios only last about 3 
weeks before some countermeasure comes along and they have to 
reprogram the radio or change a wave form. We see the Excalibur 
munition, its targeting system dropped from 70 percent 
effectiveness to 6 percent effectiveness over a matter of a few 
months as new EW [electronic warfare] mechanisms came out.
    If we expect our major weapon system programs to follow 
these waterfall processes where we spend years planning a tech 
refresh, how do you ever hope to adapt in competition?
    Mr. Gaetz. But that is what we are doing now.
    Dr. Patt. That's right. This is the problem.
    Mr. Gaetz. Help us liberate ourselves from this.
    Dr. Patt. So, much of it is going to go back to--there is 
two principles, and Congressman, you introduced--so one, we've 
talked a little bit about ATOs already, that is one. The other 
principle you just brought up is this notion of vendor lock. 
One, I want to point out that an ATO is another mechanism by 
which one can achieve vendor lock, we are beginning to see this 
already. Some companies get a continuous ATO, and then they 
seek to use that to lock themselves in because it is so 
expensive. Companies can spend $1 million just getting through 
an ATO process.
    But there are a set of principles, and these are known as 
the MOSA [Modular Open Systems Approach] principles and 
actually, Congress put this in place, and Ms. Lord oversaw a 
number of efforts. But these are poorly used. What MOSA 
principles do is they say, the program manager, who is in 
charge of the acquisition, shall define modules and interfaces 
and make those interfaces available to qualified contractors to 
the government. And what this does is this allows other 
companies to come along, they see the data, they see the 
interface, and they can make new software that works with that.
    If the government has the right infrastructure, it can 
figure out how to test this and make sure that it works 
effectively in context. So the principles exist; in fact, put 
in law. They are just poorly adopted.
    Mr. Gaetz. Well, yeah, that is because people are 
protecting their turf. I greatly appreciate that.
    I have got further questions for you, Dr. Murray, about AI 
and hypersonics, but I see my time has expired and so I will be 
submitting those for the record.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Luttrell. Ms. Slotkin, you are recognized for 5 
minutes.
    Ms. Slotkin. Thank you. Thanks for being here. You know, I 
was at the Pentagon for 7 years and in the 5-ish years that I 
have been here we have done a ton of hearings that kind of 
looked at this issue from one way or another, just our cultural 
problem of speeding up decisionmaking, particularly as it 
relates to tech. And to the point where I feel like, to use a 
Pentagon term, we are admiring the problem, like, we're just--
we just love a hearing about it. And actually there is deep 
bipartisan agreement on the need to spin up and to speed up 
that string on going from concept to fielding of the technology 
of any kind, obviously software being some of the most 
complicated.
    And it has led me to believe, even as someone who, you 
know, cares deeply about the Pentagon and our national 
security, that it's not, you know, any one program or any one 
authority, it is truly culture, culture across administrations, 
culture across leaders. And I am not, like, a burn-it-down kind 
of person, you know, saying like, okay, the system doesn't work 
so we need to destroy it and start from zero. But if separating 
yourself from the tech, if you could make--and some of you have 
served inside the Pentagon--if you could be queen or king for 
the day, on one cultural change, what would that be?
    And I would say, you know, aware of the fact that the 
Pentagon has a lot of rules and restrictions when they use 
taxpayer dollars that Google and Silicon Valley and everyone 
else doesn't have to adhere to. And the responsibility of 
stewarding those dollars is different than a small startup in 
Palo Alto, it is never going to be the same thing. Comparing 
the two is apples to oranges. But speaking from culture as 
people who have been either in the inside or adjacent, what is 
the one thing you would change, starting with Ms. Lord.
    Ms. Lord. I would ask leadership to demonstrate that smart 
risk management benefits the warfighter and the Nation. 
Therefore, I believe there are many more motivations and 
rewards that can be given to those individuals, whether 
civilians or in uniform, who lean forward and take smart risks. 
They manage risk, they don't try to eliminate it, and they move 
at the speed of need here. And I believe that leadership needs 
to speak up and make rewards and highlight those individuals 
who are doing the right thing and recognize that people will 
falter and not to blame them, if you will, when everybody is 
looking for perfect being the enemy of good enough.
    Ms. Slotkin. Yeah. I certainly know, in Silicon Valley, 
when I have the chance to visit, it is like people wear their 
mistakes as a badge of honor. I started a company, it didn't 
succeed, but I learned these important lessons, and now I am on 
my third company and look at all this amazing stuff.
    It was so strange as a Pentagon official to visit Silicon 
Valley and hear people talking about their failures because at 
the Pentagon, you would never talk about your failures, right?
    Ms. Lord. Well, and with all due respect, I think Congress 
has a piece of this.
    Ms. Slotkin. For sure, for sure.
    Sir, we will just go down the line here, Mr. Murray.
    Dr. Murray. Yeah, so I think it is a great question and I 
think you are right, changing that culture is going to be hard 
and how do we do it. I think there are lots of things we could 
do. If I could sort of be king for a day, I think one of the 
things I would do is change the way we think about the teams of 
people that are working on software. If you look at what 
happens in Silicon Valley or other places, you see a lot of 
this turnover, right. People are not there for 10, 20, 30 years 
doing this, right. They come in for 2 years, they do this part, 
they go out, they start another company, they go to another 
place. How do we take advantage of the commercial sector, bring 
them into government for a short period of time. Put them in a 
position that is skipping a couple of GS levels and other 
things because they are super talented, they know what to do, 
we get them in there.
    I think they will help change that culture because they 
will ask why. Why are we doing it this way? Why don't we do it 
this way? I know how to do it that way. So I think that is what 
I would do, right. We have to change the culture. We are not 
going to change the culture by just taking the people who are 
there and saying change. I think we do that by bringing people 
in who look different and think about things differently, 
right, and that is one way to do it.
    Ms. Slotkin. Very quickly in my remaining time, Dr. Patt.
    Dr. Patt. Yeah, I think fostering a culture of doers is 
really the key here, which is encouraging the accountability 
down to an individual program manager for the outcomes they 
achieve. When you run a decades-long development, and you only 
serve in a position for a few years, it is very hard to have a 
sense of accountability or responsibility or pride in the 
outcomes that get delivered. But the great thing about software 
is you can compress these delivery timelines and suddenly, you 
can start to celebrate this. And, you know, combined with the 
suggestion that Dr. Murray just made of bringing in people for 
short tours of duty from commercial industry, I think you can 
get a vibrancy and dynamism in the perspective and talent to 
drive to results.
    Ms. Slotkin. Thanks very much. My time--I yield back.
    Mr. Luttrell. Thank you, Ms. Slotkin.
    Mr. McCormick, you are recognized for 5 minutes, sir.
    Dr. McCormick. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you to the 
witnesses for being here today.
    I am going to start--it is fascinating, I love the variety 
of questions. It has kind of been all over the map and you guys 
have been such great subject matter experts.
    I am going to go a little off the chart of things that I 
was supposed to ask today because I am fascinated by this 
topic, and we have a couple doctors in technological fields. I 
am a doctor in medicine. And it is interesting to watch how AI 
has been developed and how it has taken these columns, very 
similar to the way the brain is-- this is kind of fascinating 
for the kids out there and how AI is developed. And different 
parts of your brain affect different parts of your body. 
Specifically, it is designed for this part of the brain for 
your arm, this part for your leg, this part for your eyesight, 
this part for your hearing. This is your decisionmaking, this 
is your personality. And we have done the same thing in AI 
since we can no longer rely on Moore's law to shrink the size 
of these chips. And there is one atomic structure of thinness 
per layer, which is fascinating to me, that we can actually 
design software to go in this hardware and fit into these 
capacities to do specific functions just like we do in our 
brain. It is fascinating that after all this technology and all 
this science, we are getting back to the way that God designed 
the brain. It is fascinating to me.
    My question is, and this is for my two technology experts 
is, as we do this, and we are designing software into--to match 
the hardware, and we are going forward, and AI accelerates that 
process, how does that affect cybersecurity and our enemies' 
ability to combat us and how do we unleash that potential as we 
design the software going forward?
    Dr. Murray. I will give it a start. So as I said earlier I 
think it is hard for us to predict the impact that AI is going 
to have. It is clear it is going to be huge and we have figure 
out how to take advantage of that. Our adversaries are going to 
take advantage of that. And so, if we are not on the front end 
of that, we are in trouble. I think one of the things we have 
to do is start saying, we need to be using AI to design 
software. We need to be using AI to test software. We need to 
be using AI to try and attack software internal to what we are 
doing, right? Where is that happening now, right? What are the 
AI programs that are saying, hey, we write code with AI, we 
test code with AI, and other things. Why? Because if we are not 
smart at that, we are not going to be able to take advantage as 
that technology goes so quickly.
    It is fascinating, I think, because AI is one of those 
areas, I heard a talk by John Hennessy, former president of 
Stanford. And he said, AI is one of those areas where the 
developers of the technology were legitimately surprised by 
what it could do. They didn't know that it would be able to 
code. They didn't know it would be able to do these things. It 
is amazing, right, to have that, you know, John Hennessy has 
been involved in a lot of things but it did what they designed 
it to do. AI is something that truly is moving faster than we 
thought it would move. I think it is going to be huge. I think 
the DOD needs to take advantage of that. I think we ought to be 
asking where are the AI efforts that are happening in use of 
large language models for coding and other things.
    Dr. McCormick. Dr. Patt, before you get started, one of the 
things I also want you to consider as a university kind of guy, 
too. Georgia Tech has three different columns of AI 
development. But we all said 250,000 students from India just 
alone here in the United States studying. We have got a ton of 
kids from China studying. And we have all of our AI production 
over in Taiwan at TSMC [Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing 
Company], right? So we have production overseas, we have our 
technologies going back overseas, that is another consideration 
I want to--you know, how do we protect this stuff from being 
used against us when we are training those people and producing 
the chips overseas in a nation that we said we are going to 
take over. I am just concerned about the security measures of 
that.
    Dr. Patt. Yes, this is an important question. The 
complexity of our software and our hardware and the codesign is 
absolutely exploding. I will say, though, that you can use this 
complexity as a tool. For example, one of the things you can do 
is you can create a chip, you can produce the hardware, and 
then you can set features of it later. You can defer some of 
that, and you can build in forms of defense.
    But at the same time, you know, I don't think it is 
possible to prevent all vulnerabilities beforehand. This is one 
of the reasons why being able to go back and drive updates, 
detect anomalies, detect problems, and drive updates is so 
important. And we begin to see this now, for example, in some 
of the Navy operational networks of automated anomaly 
detection, and then they are able to go push a patch before any 
users see a problem. So tools like this, of figuring out how to 
use this exploding complexity that we see to the advantage of 
the U.S. is how we stay ahead.
    Dr. McCormick. Thank you. Ms. Lord, I am going to just kind 
of push that question back on you. Again, we always talk about 
securing our software as we develop. We are the leaders in 
technology as far as developing software, but we don't create 
our own hardware when it comes to AI. How do we protect our 
technologies from the bad guys.
    Ms. Lord. I think what we have to do is look at this from 
both a defensive and offensive point of view. And it is 
absolutely critical that we have standards that are held to 
when we look at the system level, that we also understand the 
provenance of all hardware and software that we include. Right 
now, we don't always understand the beneficial ownership of 
some of the companies in our supply chain. And frankly, AI has 
done an incredible job in illuminating supply chains just 
scraping publicly available information to really understand 
where items began.
    So the Department of Defense has begun to put some 
contracts in place to use that technology. And cybersecurity 
standards are already, to some degree, in the acquisition 
policies, but that needs to be followed up on.
    Dr. McCormick. Thanks. I yield. Thank you.
    Mr. Luttrell. Thank you, Mr. McCormick.
    Mr. Ryan, sir, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Ryan. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you all for being 
here and really appreciate your input and also your service in 
many various hats to the country. Despite my desire to ask 
about TikTok, I am not going to do that this morning. I am sure 
many in our audience would be curious, myself included.
    I want to follow up on my colleague Ms. Slotkin's sort of 
line of questioning and something specifically you said, Ms. 
Lord. You started to say, Congress has a role in this 
discussion about culture and risk--changing the risk sort of 
appetite, if you will, and tolerance. Could you talk a little 
bit more about that, any specific ideas you have and we will 
turn it to others, too.
    Ms. Lord. Absolutely. I think often it is easy to look at 
what has gone wrong in DOD and pound on that a little bit, if 
you will. But I think, perhaps, if thoughtful questions about 
what did you learn from this? How did it happen? How do we do 
things differently in the future? That line of discussion would 
be very useful. Also, I think asking questions about what is 
holding you back from taking more risk. And I think that there 
is an incredible fear of failure. And if you could engage 
senior leadership in the building relative to discussions about 
that and ask them how you motivate and reward them to act more 
like the commercial sector where we do things quickly, we pull 
the patches, you know, in a day or so. I think that would be 
really, really useful.
    Mr. Ryan. Just in setting up others to answer, too, and 
somewhat leading, but is there--not to overly formalize it, but 
do you think it could ever make sense for there to be some more 
public, or more broad assessment of which programs, which 
leaders, which individuals are accepting risk, sort of holding 
them up in a somewhat more formal way.
    Ms. Lord. Absolutely. For years, when I was in the building 
we talked about holding hearings to showcase these types of 
individuals. And I believe the reality is that scheduling does 
not allow you to do that type of thing. There are things like 
TikTok that you need to work about--to talk about and work on. 
But there is so much you can do just with recognition with 
letters, with talking to the media, showing--inviting people up 
to your office for an hour or so. It just doesn't cost much, 
would go a long way, and it would cast a very long shadow.
    Mr. Ryan. Thank you.
    Dr. Murray. So, you know, I think Congress does play a role 
in shaping the culture of the DOD. And it is the way you ask 
the questions, I think in part, right? If you do something 
where you say, here are all the requirements, why didn't you 
meet these requirements, why is it over budget, et cetera, you 
are forcing us into a system in which we are looking at the 
requirements and checking all the boxes, and that may not be 
the right answer. If you look at speed and cycle time as your 
main metrics, and for software programs that is what it is, how 
quickly can you get something out into the field. That is 
fantastic. Can we get a leader board going, to your point, 
right, where we sort of say, this program they have got their 
sort of time down to 1 week or 2 weeks, you know, why is it 
that they are doing better? Maybe we get people in a friendly 
competition, right, for saying we have got the best speed and 
cycle time, right. Can we make those things public? Can we say, 
here's how quickly these different software-dominated programs 
can get things out into the field and working.
    Mr. Ryan. Thank you. Love the leader board.
    Dr. Patt. One of the most remarkable technological 
achievements is just how safe civil air travel is. It is 
remarkable how few fatalities come out of this. And the reason 
that it became so safe and so successful is there was a strong 
culture around a blame-free debrief, which is if you step 
forward and you talk about the problem, then it is about 
learning, it is not about failure. This is the same principle 
that we need to apply here as we figure out collectively how to 
do software right.
    Just to call out two specific examples. Many of you have 
heard of this Air Force project called Kessel Run which is 
about software delivery. Many of you have also heard about the 
Air Force's ABMS, the Advanced Battle Management System, that 
is run by PEO C3BM [Program Executive Office, Command, Control, 
Communications and Battle Management] in the Air Force, General 
Cropsey. Both of those efforts are efforts which did deep hard 
introspection about their early efforts, and they said, you 
know what? We need to pivot. The early choices that we made 
around architecture and how to approach this or how we think 
about managing this effort aren't right and we need to pivot. 
Those are the kinds of people, the kind of decisions, and that 
sort of blame-free culture, that focus on learning that you 
need to make this work.
    Mr. Ryan. I appreciate that. And I think just with the 20 
seconds I have left, I think recognizing that that has to start 
from the very, very top, and has to be a principle of all the 
senior, senior leadership is just something that I think we can 
hopefully all agree.
    So thank you, Mr. Chair. I yield back the balance.
    Mr. Luttrell. Thank you, Mr. Ryan.
    Mr. Khanna, closing statement?
    Mr. Khanna. I just want to thank the excellent witnesses 
and your very concrete recommendations. And appreciate your 
time.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Luttrell. Thank you again as well, coming in--shedding 
light and amplifying information of--again, we have talked 
about it. We learn more from our failures than we ever will our 
successes.
    To your point, sir, in the military, we often never spoke 
about how well the operation went. We always talked about how 
horrible the small things, or in order to capitalize that on 
the next op. I have been sitting back here trying to--I think I 
have it, but I am not going to say it out loud. I think I know 
why the reason why we are so risk averse in the House of 
Representatives. And I will just keep that to myself since I am 
on TV right now. But my colleagues and I will definitely 
discuss that behind closed doors. But again, thank you.
    So, members will have 5 business days to submit their 
questions for the record. This committee is now adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 9:52 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

                  QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. GALLAGHER

    Mr. Gallagher. Ms. Lord, you are very familiar with the ``authority 
to operate'' or ATO process from your time as Under Secretary. As you 
know, the process is extremely slow and inefficient. However, software 
evolves at the speed of war; in Ukraine for instance, their software-
defined platforms can be updated in hours or days, while updates 
through our ATO process takes several months, at best. As a result, the 
ATO process makes it impossible for our forces to field the best 
software at the speed of war. How do you suggest we fix this process to 
ensure our service members can leverage the best software on the 
battlefield?
    Ms. Lord. I recommend continue working with the OSD CIO, John 
Sherman, as well as each of the Military Service CIO's to prioritize 
scaling the current continuous ATO projects to encompass an increasing 
percentage of software programs on an annual basis with a three year 
goal to move to 100% continuous ATO implication. (I have personally 
spoken with John Sherman about the need to accelerate this process.) As 
the technology exists, there appears to be more of a cultural and 
leadership challenge to cATO implementation. Requiring six month 
updates from the OSD CIO would provide visibility to Congress, as well 
as industry, to the progress.

    Mr. Gaetz. On February 19, 2024, Interestingengineering.com 
reported that EpiSci was chosen for U.S. AI hypersonic missile tracking 
system software:
    EpiSci has won a $1.6 million contract with the U.S. Space 
Development Agency to flesh out its AI-powered, hypersonic missile 
tracking system.
    The U.S. Space Development Agency (SDA) has officially chosen 
California-based EpiSci to develop its planned cutting-edge software to 
detect hypersonic missiles in flight. This initiative marks a 
significant advancement in missile defense capabilities, leveraging the 
power of artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze extensive data from 
low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites.
    A key factor of developing hypersonic defense is knowing when and 
where they might be deployed.
    Are you familiar with the Hypersonic detection program and the 
development of AI based software to detect the deployment of weapons?
    What roadblocks has the DOD faced when developing software to 
deploy and detect hypersonic weapons?
    Are there software related complications preventing our hypersonic 
weapons from hitting a moving target?
    How far away are we, not a specific date, FY25 or 29? I'm just

    Ms.  Lord. I am generally aware of the challenge of tracking 
hypersonic missiles, but have not worked on this issue for three years. 
The challenge is not only the software, but establishing a network of 
space-based sensors to provide sufficient fidelity to cover incoming 
missiles and then providing the electronics to transmit the target data 
in real-time. The real-time integration of sensors, communication 
electronics and software is a complex task.

    Dr. Patt. I am not directly familiar with the specifics of the 
Hypersonic detection program and EpiSci's software. However, based on 
my general knowledge of defense software development, I would 
anticipate that the software challenges for hypersonic tracking are 
similar to those faced in fielding other advanced sensor or weapon 
systems. As outlined in Appendix A, the attached policy memo 
``Compiling Advantage'', co-authored with the Honorable Ellen Lord, the 
Department of Defense faces several key roadblocks in rapidly 
developing and deploying software, including onerous Authority to 
Operate (ATO) processes, talent gaps, lack of access to data and 
interfaces, and inflexible resourcing. Overcoming these challenges to 
enable greater software adaptability will be critical for the DOD to 
outpace adversaries in areas like hypersonic detection and defense. 
While I cannot comment on a specific timeline, continued Congressional 
support and funding will be essential to ensure the DOD can attract top 
technical talent, reform cumbersome processes, and drive the 
innovations needed to achieve parity with competitors in critical 
technology areas. The attachment provides a detailed analysis of the 
roadblocks and potential solutions.

                   QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. FALLON
    Mr. Fallon. Ms. Lord, during your time as Under Secretary of 
Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment the Department of Defense 
decided to replace the Defense Travel System (DTS), a twenty-year old 
legacy software that was found to contribute to almost $1 billion of 
improper payments, with a commercial travel and expense system. The 
decision to use commercial technology solutions is in line with decades 
of precedence in statute and regulation and supported in the recent 
PPBE Commission Report. Unfortunately, following your ten-year in the 
DOD, the current administration decided to turn its back on 
modernization and to stick with DTS because the military services were 
not adopting the solution as mandated by the Under Secretary of Defense 
for Personnel and Readiness. In June of last year, the GAO testified 
that DOD does not have the power to reform business operations when the 
services do not agree.
    Is the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness the 
best office to implement enterprise-wide software transformation and 
modernization for travel? If not, what office within the Office of the 
Secretary of Defense should take on the modernization of defense 
travel?
    Ms.  Lord. I would send a letter to SecDef Austin, copying the 
DepSecDef Hicks, directing Hon LaPlante as UnderSecretary of 
Acquisition and Sustainment to contract a new commercial travel system 
within the next six months with support from the CIO. The effort 
supports the need to upgrade multiple business systems with 
commercially available software versus contracting for a bespoke 
system. An update on progress in three months should be requested.
                                 ______
                                 
                   QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. LaLOTA
    Mr. LaLota. During recent Congressional testimony before the Armed 
Services Committee, Lieutenant General Michael Schmidt, overseeing the 
F-35 Program, testified that the testing of new software in labs before 
flight trials is a significant bottleneck, leading to unforeseen 
challenges and delays. I suspect this issue isn't exclusive to the F-35 
but prevalent across various weapon systems, illustrating a gap between 
our rapid software development pace and testing capabilities, 
ultimately hindering timely capability delivery to our forces. In an 
era focused on innovation, it's critical we resolve this.
    Could you shed light on whether software test capacity is indeed a 
bottleneck in weapon system deliveries? What strategies can be 
implemented to enhance DOD software integration labs' capacity and 
efficiency? Additionally, considering the costs of acquiring necessary 
physical hardware, how feasible is the development of a virtual test 
environment to supplement our current capabilities and meet the DOD's 
growing needs?
    Ms.  Lord. Software testing is indeed a bottleneck. Making 
developmental testing and operational testing a continuum is key to 
speeding the fielding process. In other words, taking credit for 
testing conducted during development should count towards operational 
testing versus repeating testing. The Director of Operational Test and 
Development should be tasked with establishing a process that not only 
counts developmental test towards production testing, but ensures that 
hardware in the loop testing at Patuxent River is conducted 24/7. The 
JPO Director and PEO should be required to submit written updates on 
software testing acceleration on a quarterly basis along with Lockheed 
Martin.
                                 ______
                                 
                  QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY DR. McCORMICK
    Dr. McCormick. Secretary Lord, for quite some time federal law has 
preferred the procurement and use of commercial business systems (10 
U.S.C. 2222(b)(4)) and best practices (10 U.S.C. 2222(a)). The thought 
being, if it works for industry the federal government should not have 
to reinvent the wheel and can focus on solving problems that are not 
found in the commercial sector. I was pleased to see that the final 
report of the PPBE Commission, which you were the Vice Chair, supports 
the use of commercial business systems. Yet, as the Commission 
identified DOD's practices and digital culture result in the continued 
use and investment in bespoke solutions (PPBE Commission Final Report 
page 106--first two paragraphs under ``Shortfalls in DOD Practices and 
Digital Culture). The report states that ``Business system reform 
should be accompanied with the equally important streamlining of 
business processes and practices'' (PPBE Commission Final Report--see 
third paragraph on page 107) or change management. There is no clearer 
example of failed change management than the DOD's decision to end its 
transition away from the Defense Travel System to a modern commercial 
solution.
    If you may, who is in charge of digital change management within 
the Department and the services regarding business systems? 
Additionally, what can Congress do to empower these individuals to 
ensure the law if followed and that those in uniform are not stuck with 
legacy systems like DTS for another twenty years?
    Ms.  Lord. The SecDef should receive a letter from Congress 
directing the Undersecretary for Acquisition and Sustainment to procure 
a commercial travel system, with advice from the DOD CIO, in the next 
six months. The DepSecDef should be copied and a written update in 
three months should be required. This issue needs to be elevated to the 
SecDef level and Dr. LaPlante needs to be empowered to move forward 
quickly with the procurement while SecDef must compel the Military 
Services and Agencies to establish and implement a transition from 
legacy systems to a new commercial system within the next fiscal year.
    Dr. McCormick. Dr. Patt, in 2019, the Defense Innovation Board 
issued a report encouraging the use of ``. . . commercial software 
whenever possible . . .'' and that ``DOD should not build something 
that it can buy.'' It went on to say that `. . . DOD should take 
actions to ensure that both the letter and spirit of commercial 
preference laws (e.g., 10 USC 2377, which requires defense agencies to 
give strong preference to commercial and non-developmental products) 
are being followed'' (SWAP Study page 47). Unfortunately, the DOD 
continues to develop its own business systems rather than conform to 
existing commercial solutions. Nearly five years after the publication 
of this report, the DOD decided to maintain the Defense Travel System, 
a legacy system more than twenty years old and responsible for 
approximately $1 billion in improper payments rather than use a 
commercial solution that was already available in the DOD system. In a 
recent War on the Rocks Article, titled Software Defines Tactics, you 
highlighted ``When a program can cleanly express a need, including its 
reliability . . . the program's first instinct should be to outsource 
that capability to a commercial or dual-use provider.''
    Why is it that that the DOD is not incentivized nor managed to 
outsource these capabilities and leverage commercial systems and 
business best practices? What can the DOD do to heed your advice?
    Dr. Patt. The DOD's challenges in leveraging commercial solutions 
often contrast with the well-established ``Commercial Items 
Preference'' outlined in sections 1906, 1907, and 3307 of title 41, 
United States Code, and sections 2375, 2376, and 2377 of title 10, 
United States Code. A key issue is that Department of Defense 
requirements are often structured in a way that bundles unique defense-
specific features together with components that are readily available 
commercially off-the-shelf. One potential acquisition approach feasible 
today is to unbundle these aspects and use techniques like modular 
contracting to gradually evolve the defense-unique features. However, 
acquisition officials often perceive this unbundled approach as higher 
risk compared to a single monolithic contract. Driving change at scale 
would require either: 1) Continued training for the acquisition and 
contracting workforce on how to structure procurements to maximize 
commercial leverage, or 2) Rethinking how the DOD generates and 
competes requirements, shifting from a ``build-to-spec'' to a ``buy-
and-evolve'' mindset. Today, practices around competitive procedures 
often incentivize a lowest-price, technically acceptable (LPTA) 
approach against a common specification, rather than allowing for 
tradeoffs between features, timelines, and overall value. Enabling the 
DOD to flexibly adopt commercial solutions may require consideration of 
the risk that contracting officers face in interpreting acceptable 
competitive procedures. The policy recommendations outlined in the 
attached ``Compiling Advantage'' memo provide some guidelines to 
address these systemic issues.
