    SURVEYING CIRCIA: SECTOR PERSPECTIVES ON THE NOTICE OF PROPOSED 
                               RULEMAKING

                              ----------                              


                         Wednesday, May 1, 2024

             U.S. House of Representatives,
                    Committee on Homeland Security,
                         Subcommittee on Cybersecurity and 
                                 Infrastructure Protection,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:05 p.m., in 
room 310, Cannon House Office building, Hon. Andrew R. 
Garbarino (Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
    Present: Representatives Garbarino, Ezell, Lee, Green (ex 
officio), Swalwell, Menendez, and Clarke.
    Mr. Garbarino. The Committee on Homeland Security's 
Subcommittee on Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection 
will come to order.
    The purpose of this hearing is to receive testimony from a 
panel of experts and industry leaders who provide their 
perspectives on CISA's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking relating 
to the implementation of the Cyber Incident Reporting for 
Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022, commonly referred to as 
CIRCIA.
    I now recognize myself for an opening statement.
    About 2 years ago, Congress woke up to gaps in cyber 
incident reporting. Public and private-sector entities have 
long complied with a patchwork of disparate niche cyber 
incident reporting requirements managed by an array of 
regulators.
    As stated in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that we will 
discuss today, there are currently more than 3 dozen different 
Federal cyber incident reporting requirements in effect, 3 
dozen.
    In an age of increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks on 
our critical infrastructure, our fragmented approach to 
incident reporting has proven anything but nimble and useful. 
It is cumbersome and oftentimes redundant, creating a 
compliance burden on private-sector partners who could be 
spending their resources on security rather than fulfilling 
multiple reporting requirements. A confusing and reactive, 
rather than proactive, reporting regime increases the risk of 
the security of our homeland.
    After significant national attacks on Colonial Pipeline and 
solar winds, Congress recognized an urgent need for better and 
more coordinated cyber incident reporting for our critical 
infrastructure. This included a need to develop a process for 
reporting ransom payments which didn't exist, despite the rise 
impact of ransomware attacks.
    As a result, in March 2022, Congress passed the bipartisan 
Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act, or 
CIRCIA. This landmark legislation tasked the Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency to develop regulations to set 
the standard for cyber incident reporting across critical 
infrastructure sectors.
    As the Nation's risk manager, CISA must be empowered to 
identify cross-sector points of vulnerability and share 
information to mitigate such risks. As the lifeline of our 
national security, economic security, and public health and 
safety, critical infrastructure entities must be supported as 
they adapt to a world where cyber attacks are not an ``if'' but 
a ``when.''
    Since CIRCIA was signed into law, the American people have 
continued to feel the impacts of numerous costly intrusions 
into critical infrastructure sectors by cyber threat actors 
from the water sector to the health care sector. This cannot 
continue.
    It is imperative that we get the CIRCIA rule right. CIRCIA 
should serve as the standard, not another regulation standing 
in the way of effective cyber defense. Because it is so 
important we get this right, I'm encouraged to hear that CISA 
is granting a 30-day extension for submitting comments.
    Members of this subcommittee have eagerly awaited the draft 
rule that we are going to discuss in depth, especially 
considering conflicting rules such as the SEC's public cyber 
disclosure rule. Therefore, we are devoting this hearing to 
CIRCIA because we know this is an opportunity, one to ensure 
regulatory effectiveness and harmonization.
    I want to thank our witnesses, Scott Aaronson from Edison 
Electric Institute, Heather Hogsett from Bank Policy Institute, 
Robert Mayer from the USTelecom, and Amit Elazari from 
OpenPolicy Group for being here today to help us understand how 
specific sectors will be impacted.
    We cannot effectively implement CIRCIA without private-
sector perspective. So thank you for your partnership.
    Implementation of CIRCIA's more important than ever for our 
cyber preparedness. The final CIRCIA rule, expected late next 
year, will mark a pivotal turning point for America's ability 
to mitigate cyber risks and protect our national security, 
economy, and way of life.
    I look forward to our witness' testimony and discussing how 
the proposed CIRCIA rule can ensure a more capable and ready 
national cyber defense.

    I look forward to our witnesses' testimony and discussing how the

defense.

    Mr. Garbarino. I now recognize the Ranking Member, the 
gentleman from California, Mr. Swalwell, for his opening 
statement.
    Mr. Swalwell. I thank the Chairman for giving our 
subcommittee an opportunity to hear from the private sector on 
CISA's proposed cyber incident reporting rule which is the 
agency's, frankly, most significant undertaking since it was 
established.
    I told the witnesses, before we began, you'll see a lot of 
fireworks in this room. You'll see both sides battle it out. 
But on this issue of cybersecurity, we are aligned. There's 
really no daylight between us on making sure that we give 
America's businesses and Government agencies the resources they 
need to defend against attacks from abroad and from within.
    Before I begin, Chairman, if it's OK, I would like to just 
take a moment to acknowledge the passing of Congressman Donald 
Payne, Jr. Congressman Payne had an important impact on CISA, 
the agency we oversee. Because of his advocacy, CISA has a 
standing school security mission within the Infrastructure 
Security Division which works to make schools K-12 and 
universities safer and more secure.
    Personally, Congressman Payne and I were both elected in 
the class of 2012. I sat next to him on this committee for all 
of my going-on-12 years in Congress. He will be greatly missed 
by Members of this committee, as we send out our most sincere 
condolences to his family and constituents.
    Turning to CIRCIA, CIRCIA was born out of crisis. A series 
of high-profile cyber incidents occurred in 2020 and 2021 like 
solar wind supply chain attack, the Kaseya compromise, and the 
Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack. They revealed unacceptable 
blind spots in the Federal Government's awareness of malicious 
cyber activity on U.S. networks.
    The Federal Government was forced to rely on voluntary 
cyber incident reporting. So we will never know the full extent 
of who was impacted by the Solar Winds attack. Reporting from 
the Colonial Pipeline was initially delayed.
    Incomplete information frustrates our ability to understand 
the motives and goals of our adversaries and delays information 
sharing, limiting our ability to prevent additional attacks.
    Congress passed CIRCIA so CISA and its partners could 
detect and quickly disrupt malicious actors as soon as possible 
and identified the evolving tactics of our adversaries so that 
we could strategically reduce risk.
    CIRCIA's success rests on getting this final rule right. I 
appreciate CISA's work to engage with the private sector early 
in the rulemaking process and to extend the comment period.
    Moving forward, it's imperative that CISA strongly consider 
and incorporate feedback from the private sector, particularly 
as it refines key definitions including covered entity and 
covered cyber incident and the required components of cyber 
incident reports.
    I also urge CISA to apply lessons learned from programs 
like Automated Indicator Sharing, also known as AIS. When 
Congress authorized AIS nearly a decade ago, we hoped it would 
achieve some of the same goals we have for CIRCIA today. But 
AIS never achieved its potential in part because it focused too 
often on quantity over quality.
    New technology may enable CISA to draw insights from a 
higher volume of CIRCIA reports more quickly, particularly the 
advancements in AI. But I question whether it will be able to 
adequately overcome complications from the kind of 
overreporting that is likely to occur, given the breadth of 
current definitions.
    Implementation of CIRCIA will be expensive for both the 
Government and private sector, and we must ensure that it 
yields real value. To just specify more plainly and frankly, we 
have to make sure that we don't wrap up nonrelevant small and 
medium-sized businesses in recording requirements that can both 
be cumbersome and expensive to the businesses and provide 
worthless data to CISA.
    I understand, again, that CISA plans to grant an extension. 
We're pleased that they're doing so. I also share Chairman 
Garbarino's frustration with duplicative cyber incident 
reporting requirements, particularly with the SEC's unworkable 
rule and unrealistic rule.
    Now that NPRM is public, I hope the Cyber Incident 
Reporting Council will redouble its efforts to promote 
harmonization and that my colleagues in Congress will refrain 
from passing additional redundant reporting requirements.
    Again, I commend my colleagues, especially Ms. Clarke on 
this committee, and the witnesses here today for the work 
they're putting in to getting CIRCIA across the finish line. 
CIRCIA showed that improving the Nation's cybersecurity posture 
is a bipartisan goal and one that the private sector was 
willing to work with us to accomplish.
    I hope we can continue to work together with the private 
sector and on this committee to do big things like passing 
important legislation that will improve how the Federal 
Government collaborates with the private sectors by authorizing 
the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative, JCDC.
    I'd also like to congratulate CISA on the publication of 
the NPRM. It's an important milestone and an enormous 
undertaking, and I look forward to working with CISA to clarify 
reporting requirements and to build out the analytical capacity 
necessary to derive actionable insights from CIRCIA reporting.
    Again before I close, I'd like to ask unanimous consent 
that the Congresswoman from New York, Yvette Clarke, be 
permitted to participate in today's hearing.
    Mr. Garbarino. Agreed.
    Mr. Swalwell. Yield back.
    [The statement of Ranking Member Swalwell follows:]
               Statement of Ranking Member Eric Swalwell
                              May 1, 2024
    I would like to thank the Chairman for giving the subcommittee the 
opportunity to hear from the private sector on CISA's proposed cyber 
incident reporting rule--the agency's most significant undertaking 
since it was established. But before I begin, I would like to take a 
moment to acknowledge the passing of Congressman Donald Payne, Jr.
    Although Congressman Payne did not sit on this subcommittee, he had 
an important impact on CISA, the agency we oversee. Because of 
Congressman Payne's advocacy, CISA has a standing school security 
mission within the Infrastructure Security Division, which works to 
make K-12 schools and universities safer and more secure. He will be 
greatly missed by Members of this committee, and we send our most 
sincere condolences to his family and constituents.
    Turning to the subject of today's hearing: Implementation of the 
Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA). 
CIRCIA was borne out of crisis. A series of high-profile cyber 
incidents in 2020 and 2021--like the SolarWinds supply chain attack, 
the Kaseya compromise, and the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack--
revealed unacceptable blind spots in the Federal Government's awareness 
of malicious cyber activity on U.S. networks. The Federal Government 
was forced to rely on voluntary cyber incident reporting, so we never 
knew the full extent of who was impacted by the SolarWinds attack, and 
reporting from Colonial Pipeline was initially delayed. Incomplete 
information frustrates our ability to understand the motives and goals 
of our adversaries and delays information sharing--limiting our ability 
to prevent additional attacks.
    Congress passed CIRCIA so CISA and its partners could detect and 
disrupt malicious cyber campaigns sooner and identify the evolving 
tactics of our adversaries to more strategically reduce risk. CIRCIA's 
success rests on getting the final rule right. I appreciate CISA's work 
to engage with the private sector early in the rulemaking process 
through the Request for Information and for the thorough NPRM published 
earlier this month.
    Moving forward, it is imperative that CISA strongly consider and 
incorporate feedback from the private sector, particularly as it 
refines key definitions--including ``covered entity'' and ``covered 
cyber incident''--and the required components of cyber incident 
reports. I also urge CISA to apply lessons learned from programs like 
Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS).
    When Congress authorized AIS nearly a decade ago, we hoped it would 
achieve some of the same goals we have for CIRCIA today. But AIS never 
achieved its potential, in part, because it focused on quantity over 
quality and produced too many reports that lacked value. New technology 
may enable CISA to draw insights from a higher volume of CIRCIA reports 
more quickly, but I question whether it will be able to adequately 
overcome complications from the kind of overreporting that is likely to 
occur given the breadth of current definitions.
    Implementation of CIRCIA will be expensive for both the Government 
and private sector, and we must ensure that it yields real security 
value. Toward that end, I understand many stakeholders, including some 
of our witnesses, have requested CISA extend the public comment period 
by 30 days. I understand that CISA plans to grant that extension and am 
pleased they are doing so. I also share Chairman Garbarino's 
frustration with duplicative cyber incident reporting requirements--
particularly the SEC rule.
    Now that the NPRM is public, I hope the Cyber Incident Reporting 
Council will redouble its efforts to promote harmonization and that my 
colleagues in Congress will refrain from passing additional redundant 
reporting requirements.
    I commend my colleagues, especially Ms. Clarke, and the witnesses 
here today for the work they put into getting CIRCIA across the finish 
line. CIRCIA showed that improving the Nation's cybersecurity posture 
is a bipartisan goal, and one that the private sector was willing to

    Moving forward, I hope we can continue to work together to do big 
things, like passing important legislation that will improve how the 
Federal Government collaborates with its private-sectors partners by 
authorizing the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative, JCDC.
    I would also like to congratulate CISA on the publication of the 
NPRM--it is an important milestone in an enormous undertaking, and I 
look forward to working with CISA to clarify reporting requirements and 
to build out the analytical capacity necessary to derive actionable 
insights from CIRCIA reporting.

    Mr. Garbarino. I now--thank you, Ranking Member Swalwell.
    I now recognize the Chairman of the full Committee on 
Homeland Security, Chairman Green, for an opening statement.
    Mr. Green. Well, thank you to our witnesses for being here 
today and to give us your perspective and your expertise. It's 
deeply appreciated.
    It's--you know, as we pass legislation, getting feedback on 
that legislation is always helpful and in future endeavors to 
pass laws that work, particularly as it relates to cyber and 
fighting against nation-states and criminals who use the cyber 
space for their advantages. So thank you for coming here and 
providing your thoughts.
    I also want to thank Chairman Garbarino and the Ranking 
Member, Mr. Swalwell, for their bipartisanship. They do a great 
job in working together to advance not only legislation but 
oversight that shines light on some challenges that we have. I 
appreciate both of them and the way they work together.
    I, too, want to say something about the tragic passing of 
Congressman Payne. You know, up here when you're--as Ranking 
Member Swalwell said, it sometimes gets contentious between the 
two sides as we vie for ideologies, quite frankly, that have 
less and less overlap over the years. But there are a few 
things that really overlap, cyber being one of them.
    But in the case of Mr. Payne, you know, despite our 
differences, he was a friend. He longed for the unity and 
opportunity for when we can get together and work together on 
issues. I worked very closely with him on the Colorectal Cancer 
Caucus because he lost his father and I had, myself, colon 
cancer 8 years ago. So we worked very closely together on that.
    To his family, I know you're going to miss him. We miss 
him. Our deepest condolences go out to you at this time.
    You know, when we passed the act, our goal was to ensure 
shared visibility and, of course, substantial--all of the 
substantial incidents impacting our homeland's critical 
infrastructure. With nation-state actors such as China and 
Russia continuing to target us, we knew that we needed a better 
understanding and to better understand and defend against 
increasingly fraught cyber threats. However, we knew we needed 
to do this without imposing undue regulatory burden on our 
companies that are already stretched very thin.
    Duplicative efforts tend to wind up costing businesses 
money that they could actually use on real cybersecurity, and 
so getting to the bottom of those is one of our priorities. 
It's imperative that we strike the balance, of course, and

    I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today. Again, 
I want to thank you for being here and for being in this fight 
with us and for the future of the country.
    Thank you.

                              May 1, 2024
    When we passed CIRCIA, our goal was to ensure shared visibility of 
substantial cyber incidents impacting our homeland's critical 
infrastructure.
    With nation-state actors such as China and Russia continuing to 
target us, we knew that we needed to better understand and defend 
against increasingly fraught cyber threats. However, we knew we needed 
to do this without imposing undue regulatory burden on our companies 
that are already stretched very thin. Duplicative efforts tend to wind 
up costing businesses money that they could actually use on real 
cybersecurity, and so getting to the bottom of those is one of our 
priorities.
    It is imperative that we strike this balance and ensure the rule is 
harmonized with regulations.
    I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today.

    Mr. Garbarino. Thank you, Chairman Green.

             Statement of Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson
                              May 1, 2024
    Four years ago, this committee began work on developing a mandatory 
cyber incident reporting framework to address the Federal Government's 
lack of visibility into the cyber incidents that impact all critical 
infrastructure sectors.
    Last Congress, then-Subcommittee Chairwoman Clarke conducted an 
extensive process to introduce CIRCIA, consider and address stakeholder 
feedback, and ultimately negotiate the final enacted bill. Thanks to 
Congresswoman Clarke's leadership, a policy concept that cybersecurity 
experts had been suggesting for years finally became a reality.
    In the 2 years since enactment, CISA has undertaken the significant 
work necessary to turn statutory text into a proposed rule. For an 
agency that generally relies on voluntary partnerships rather than 
regulation, that is no easy task, and I acknowledge the hard work by 
CISA staff to get this done.
    In particular, I appreciate CISA's efforts to engage with 
stakeholders early and to draft a detailed rule that considers the 
input CISA received. This proposed rule, however, is only one step in 
the implementation process. Now, CISA must consider additional 
stakeholder feedback as it works to develop a Final Rule. I encourage 
CISA to ensure stakeholders have sufficient time to develop thoughtful 
comments on the many complicated issues that will need to be resolved. 
Getting this right will be essential to achieving the benefits Congress 
sought when enacting this legislation.
    The goal of CIRCIA is to increase the Federal Government's 
visibility into the cybersecurity incidents impacting critical 
infrastructure, helping CISA improve its analysis of the cyber threats 
facing our Nation and ultimately develop better tools, products, and 
services to help strengthen our national cyber defenses. As we evaluate 
this proposed rule, we must consider how it helps further these goals 
while minimizing unnecessary burdens on the victims of cyber attacks. 
One key aspect of reducing the burden on critical infrastructure will 
not just be determined by the final CIRCIA Rule, but on the willingness 
of other Federal agencies to work with CISA to improve the 
harmonization of cyber incident reporting mandates.
    As more Federal regulators have sought cyber incident information, 
many entities are currently subject to duplicative and inconsistent 
requirements, and it was this committee's expectation in passing CIRCIA 
that creating a mandatory reporting requirement across critical 
infrastructure would help relieve that regulatory burden, so entities 
can focus on preventing and responding to cyber intrusions.
    I appreciate the work of the Cyber Incident Reporting Council to 
issue its initial report last year, which helped inform this proposed 
rule, and encourage the Council and all Federal agencies with current 
or proposed cyber incident reporting mandates to increase their 
engagement with CISA on regulatory harmonization now that the proposed 
rule has been released.
    We also must ensure that CISA has the resources and tools necessary 
to turn incident reports into meaningful information that can be used 
to drive down cyber risk. I look forward to continuing to oversee 
CISA's plans for how to operationalize the large amounts of data the 
agency will receive and to work with our colleagues to provide CISA the 
necessary funding. CIRCIA is a demonstration of how this committee can 
enact significant national security legislation when we work together 
in a bipartisan way and engage in the hard work of considering 
stakeholder feedback and negotiating with our colleagues.
    I hope this hearing today reminds us all of how important our work 
is and how productive we can be when we prioritize finding common 
ground. Our witnesses here today represent a range of critical 
infrastructure sectors and have worked with the committee on cyber 
incident reporting for years. Their feedback will be valuable as the 
committee continues its CIRCIA oversight, and I thank them for being 
here today.
    Before I close, I would also like to take a moment to acknowledge 
the loss of a Member of the full committee, Congressman Donald Payne 
Jr., who got things done by working across the aisle and with 
stakeholders. I send the committee's condolences to his wife, Bea, and 
their triplets.

STATEMENT OF SCOTT I. AARONSON, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, SECURITY 
          AND PREPAREDNESS, EDISON ELECTRIC INSTITUTE

    Mr. Aaronson. Thank you, Chairman Garbarino.
    Before I get started, thank you for sharing Emily with us. 
Still fighting the good fight, just from a different address.
    As Chairman Garbarino, Ranking Member Swalwell, Members of 
the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify 
today on cyber incident reporting requirements, specifically in 
the context of CISA's proposed rule pursuant to the Cyber 
Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022. I'm 
just going say CIRCIA.
    My name is Scott Aaronson. I am senior vice president for 
security and preparedness at the Edison Electric Institute. EEI 
is the trade association that represents all of the Nation's 
investor-owned electric companies. These companies provide 
electricity to nearly 250 million Americans and operate in all 
50 States and the District of Columbia.
    EEI and its members appreciate Congress passing CIRCIA. 
Critical infrastructure security is a shared responsibility, 
and cyber incident report can go help Government and industry 
identify trends across sectors, leading to more effective 
policy making, information sharing, resource allocation, and 
mitigation strategies.
    That said, details matter when it comes to how CIRCIA or 
any mandatory cyber incident reporting regime is implemented. 
Both my written testimony and comments today focus on three 
related themes that will help ensure cyber reporting 
requirements generate meaningful information without 
unnecessary compliance burdens: First, the need to harmonize 
Federal mandates to ensure consistency and avoid duplication of 
efforts; second, the importance of leveraging sector risk 
management agencies, both as existing collectors of incident 
reports, as well as venues for effective information sharing 
and operational collaboration between industry and government; 
and, third, narrowing the scope of reporting requirements to 
truly impactful incidents so that we can separate signal from 
noise and glean meaningful insights that address real risks.
    With respect to harmonization, as you are well aware, 
CIRCIA is being developed among an existing patchwork of 
Federal and State incident reporting requirements. While 
President Biden's National Cybersecurity Strategy highlighted 
the importance of harmonizing incident reporting, there are 
many definitions, time lines, and expectations for reporting 
across the Federal Government including new requirements from 
the Securities and Exchange Commission's cyber reporting rule. 
We hope CIRCIA does not create additional burdens.
    Specifically we would like to see CISA referral existing 
reporting regimes from Federal counterparts to limit 
duplicative reporting through the substantially similar 
exception in CIRCIA, and we would like to see sector risk 
management agencies utilized as entry points for critical 
sectors rather than CISA trying to be all things to all 
sectors.
    While CIRCIA is the first Federal cybersecurity requirement 
focused specifically on reporting across all critical sectors, 
the electricity subsector has been subject to similar reporting 
for years through NERC's CIP 008-6 and the DOE OE-417 form.
    EEI appreciate your leadership, Chairman Garbarino, on this 
issue and is prepared to support future committee efforts to 
advance our shared harmonization goals.
    In addition to harmonizing Federal mandates, we believe 
there are aspects of CISA's proposed rule that remain overly 
broad and may add extraordinary compliance burdens with little 
to no benefit. As I testified before you alongside the banking 
and telecommunication sectors representing some of the most 
sophisticated critical infrastructure operators, there's a real 
concern that even the most mature sectors will be overburdened 
by the proposed rule if it were finalized as is.
    The committee should work with CISA to reduce the burden by 
focusing on a few areas for improvement. For example, the scope 
of substantial cyber incident definition will result in CISA 
receiving more reports than they are capable of triaging. 
CISA's estimate of 210,525 reports through 2033 seems extremely 
low. In fact, based on the current criteria, just one of EEI's 
larger members estimates at least 600 reports per month, which 
would be about 65,000 reports from a single electric company 
through 2033.
    Ingesting, parsing, triaging, protecting, and synthesizing 
this data is a monumental task, not only for CISA but for the 
companies responsible for providing these reports. Coupled with 
the 2-year data preservation requirements, CIRCIA will be 
utilizing resources that instead could be used for actual 
security mitigation measures rather than compliance.
    Instead, CISA should consider reviewing the type of 
information requested by NERC's CIP 008-6 and OE-417 to help 
guide the energy sector specific information required under 
CIRCIA.
    Finally, protection of this information is paramount. CISA 
must ensure FOIA and Critical Electric Infrastructure 
Information, or CEII, protections for these reports. As the 
committee knows, no entity, public or private, is immune to 
cyber risk. A treasure trove of incident reporting data will be 
a prime target.
    Mandatory incident reporting--report and volunteer 
information sharing both are valuable tools in ensuring the 
cybersecurity of critical infrastructure operators. EEI and its 
members are committed to working with both public and private 
partners across all sectors to comply with incident reporting 
requirements in a way that prioritizes and enhances critical 
infrastructure security.
    We look forward to working with you and CISA to develop a 
rule that leverages existing regimes, provides meaningful 
insights to government and industry, and protects sensitive 
information.
    CIRCIA is an important law with an important goal of 
identifying cyber risk across all sectors of the economy. We 
appreciate the committee's work to this point and your interest 
in making sure CISA gets it right.
    I genuinely appreciate the opportunity to testify today, 
and I look forward to the questions.

                Prepared Statement of Scott I. Aaronson
                              May 1, 2024
                              introduction
    Chairman Garbarino, Ranking Member Swalwell, and Members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify. My name is 
Scott Aaronson, and I am senior vice president for security and 
preparedness at the Edison Electric Institute (EEI). EEI is the 
association that represents all U.S. investor-owned electric companies. 
EEI's member companies provide electricity for nearly 250 million 
Americans and operate in all 50 States and the District of Columbia. 
The electric power industry supports more than 7 million jobs in 
communities across the United States. EEI's member companies invest 
more than $150 billion annually to make the energy grid stronger, 
smarter, cleaner, more dynamic, more flexible, and more secure against 
all hazards, including cyber threats. I appreciate your invitation to 
discuss this important topic on their behalf.
    The energy grid powers our way of life and is critical to America's 
security and economic competitiveness. Today, demand for electricity is 
growing dramatically across the economy to support evolving customer 
needs, as well as critical technologies like artificial intelligence 
and the proliferation of data centers that connect our digital lives. 
Ensuring a secure, reliable, resilient energy grid is a responsibility 
that EEI's member companies and the electricity subsector take 
extremely seriously.
                            threat landscape
    For years, the U.S. intelligence community has warned of the 
potential for malicious nation-state exploitation of U.S. critical 
infrastructure. Today, we know from our Federal partners that People's 
Republic of China state-sponsored cyber actors known as Volt Typhoon 
have compromised multiple U.S. critical infrastructure providers with 
the intent of disrupting operational controls, including in the energy 
sector.\1\ With the increasingly complex geopolitical threat landscape 
and the sophistication of ransomware operations by transnational 
organized criminals, we have seen an uptick in threats to critical 
infrastructure organizations across all sectors. These threats are a 
stark reminder of the need to continue to harden U.S. critical 
infrastructure.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Critical infrastructure security is a shared responsibility and a 
national imperative. While most critical infrastructure is owned by the 
private sector, Government at all levels can and must play a role in 
protecting it, especially when it comes to defending against nation-
state actors. Cyber incident reporting may support Government efforts 
to protect U.S. critical infrastructure by creating visibility into 
cross-sector cyber risk, but reporting also should be supplemented with 
Federal support to mitigate risk and harden the critical infrastructure 
assets that are vital to national security.
           harmonization of federal cyber incident reporting
    EEI recognizes the committee's intent in passing the Cyber Incident 
Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA) was to 
enhance and to standardize cyber incident reporting to improve the 
Federal Government's visibility into cyber threats and to allow the 
Government to share information quickly with critical infrastructure 
owners and operators across all 16 sectors. According to the Cyberspace 
Solarium Commission, prior to the passage of CIRCIA, the Federal 
Government lacked a mandate to collect cyber incident information 
reliably, systemically, and at the scale necessary to differentiate 
campaigns from isolated incidents and to support the development of 
more generalized conclusions.\2\ However, it is important to note that 
the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's (CISA's) new 
cyber incident reporting requirements are being developed among an 
existing patchwork of Federal and State incident reporting 
requirements. Harmonization is paramount.

(March 2020).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As part of CIRCIA's mandate, the Department of Homeland Security's 
(DHS's) Cyber Incident Reporting Council (CIRC) issued a report on 
harmonization of cyber incident reporting to the Federal Government. 
That report identified several key findings, including that there are 
currently 45 different Federal cyber incident reporting requirements 
administered by 22 Federal agencies.\3\ Given this context, CISA should 
thoroughly explore opportunities with Federal counterparts to limit 
duplicative reporting through the ``substantially similar'' exception 
of CIRCIA. This exception includes ``when a covered entity reports 
substantially similar information in a substantially similar time frame 
to another Federal agency pursuant to an existing law, regulation, or 
contract when a CIRCIA Agreement is in place between CISA and the other 
Federal agency.''\4\

2024). Accounting for and leveraging these existing incident reporting 
requirements should be a priority for CISA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
             electricity subsector cyber incident reporting
    While the CIRCIA proposed regulations are the first Federal 
cybersecurity requirements focused specifically on reporting across all 
critical infrastructure sectors, the electricity subsector has been 
subject to similar reporting to other Federal entities for years, 
including through the North American Electric Reliability Corporation 
(NERC) Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Reliability Standards 
and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Electric Emergency Incident and 
Disturbance Report OE-417 form. EEI appreciates CISA's commitment to 
working with DOE, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and 
NERC to explore the applicability of the proposed rules' substantially 
similar reporting exception to enable entities subject to CIRCIA and 
either or both the CIP Reliability Standards or Form OE-417 
requirements to be able to comply through the submission of a single 
report to the Federal Government.
    Pursuant to the Federal Power Act and through FERC oversight, the 
electricity subsector is subject to NERC's CIP Reliability Standards 
that cover cyber and physical security requirements, including CIP-008-
6: Cyber Security--Incident Reporting and Response Planning. Entities 
found in violation of CIP standards face penalties that can exceed $1 
million per violation per day. These mandatory standards continue to 
evolve using the process created by Congress to allow for input from 
subject-matter experts across the industry and government.
    DOE's Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency 
Response also requires certain energy sector entities to report certain 
cybersecurity incidents to DOE pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 772(b). As the 
energy sector's sector risk management agency (SRMA), DOE uses Form OE-
417 to collect information from the electricity subsector relevant to 
DOE's overall national security and National Response Framework 
responsibilities.
    In July 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted 
rules on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and 
Incident Disclosure by Public Companies. In addition to cyber incident 
reporting through NERC, DOE, and the SEC, EEI member companies now also 
will be subject to CIRCIA's reporting requirements once implemented 
through CISA's final rule. EEI has expressed concerns with the public 
disclosure of a cyber incident through the SEC rules, especially before 
the incident is mitigated, and we value Chairman Garbarino's leadership 
on this issue. Public reporting provides details on vulnerabilities and 
attack vectors that may become a useful roadmap for malicious actors. 
This may make the entity, and others, a target for on-going or similar 
attacks.
    The SEC, CISA, and all other Federal regulators must recognize the 
inherent sensitivity of and the need for protection of information 
regarding cybersecurity, including the risks associated with 
cybersecurity incident disclosure, and must allow reasonable 
flexibility regarding the governance of cybersecurity.\5\ EEI 
appreciates the SEC's willingness to include a national security or 
public safety delay for disclosure, but more must be done to harmonize 
Federal reporting requirements and to limit disclosure of sensitive 
cyber incidents that may provide insights to adversaries. While the 
introduction of public reporting through the SEC rules following the 
passage of CIRCIA runs counter to the CIRC harmonization report's 
recommendations and the National Cybersecurity Strategy's intent, EEI 
remains committed to working with Government partners to streamline and 
to harmonize Federal cyber incident reporting.

9, 2022).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In addition to these mandatory incident reporting requirements, the 
industry also uses voluntary cybersecurity standards, including the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity 
Framework, DOE's Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (C2M2), and, 
most recently, DOE's Cybersecurity Baselines for Electric Distribution 
Systems and Distributed Energy Resources (DER) that are being developed 
in partnership with State regulatory bodies through the National 
Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC).
    Through these standards and voluntary regimes, the U.S. energy grid 
benefits from a baseline level of security. While these standards are 
important, regulations alone are insufficient given the dynamic threat 
environment, and they must be supplemented by industry-Government 
partnerships and coordinated response and recovery efforts. The 
electric power industry appreciated the chance to contribute to the 
drafting of the proposed rule through sector-specific listening 
sessions and through comments to CISA's request for information. The 
industry aims to continue this collaborative partnership to harmonize 
reporting requirements and to reduce the burden on covered entities in 
the energy sector.
               areas for improvement in the proposed rule
    This committee left the definitions of a covered entity, cyber 
incident, covered cyber incident, and substantial cyber incident up to 
the rulemaking process to allow for industry input on the definitions 
included in the proposed rule. The electric power sector is grateful 
for the chance to partner with CISA and DOE as our SRMA to focus the 
scope and scale of these definitions in a way that prioritizes both 
security and operational continuity, as well as transparency for the 
public, policy makers, and other sectors.
    EEI joined several other critical infrastructure organizations in 
requesting an additional 30 days to analyze the lengthy proposal 
sufficiently, to determine the potential impacts to the energy sector, 
and to ensure harmonization between existing and other developing 
reporting requirements.\6\ Additional time will allow our industry to 
develop thoughts on areas for improvement in the proposed rule. EEI is 
presently working closely with its member companies in this regard, but 
we preliminarily have identified the following opportunities for 
enhancement:

    3. Workforce burden;
    4. Data preservation requirements;
    5. Protection of information.
1. Scope of Substantial Cyber Incident Definition
    CISA is proposing to define the term ``covered cyber incident'' to 
mean a ``substantial cyber incident.'' Under CIRCIA, covered entities 
would be required to report a substantial cyber incident, including 
``unauthorized access to a covered entities' information system or 
network, or any nonpublic information contained therein, that is 
facilitated through or caused by either a compromise of a cloud service 
provider, managed service provider, other third-party data hosting 
provider, or a supply chain compromise.''\7\ The inclusion of ``any 
nonpublic information'' and ``third-party data hosting provider or a 
supply chain compromise'' in this definition is very broad, which may 
result in CISA receiving far more incident reports than it is capable 
of triaging.

(CIRCIA) Reporting Requirements Proposed Rule, GOVINFO.GOV, https://
www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2024-04-04/pdf/2024-06526.pdf (April 4, 
2024).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Unfortunately, the unauthorized access to any nonpublic information 
is a common occurrence in the United States. In 2023 alone, there were 
3,205 known compromises, more than 1,400 public data breach notices, 
and more than 353 million total victims.\8\ In addition, the 
exploitation of the MOVEit vulnerability in 2023 exemplified the impact 
a supply chain compromise can have. During this event, 102 entities 
were impacted directly, however, ``1,271 organizations were indirectly 
affected when information stored in or accessed by a MOVEit product or 
service was compromised via a vendor.''\9\ Therefore, it may be more 
appropriate for CISA to require reports from third-party service 
providers who disclose non-public information, rather than require 
reports from the companies themselves that are the victims of the 
disclosure of non-public information. As CISA has championed in its 
Secure by Design initiative, the onus should be on the producers and 
developers of products, rather than on consumers and end-users.\10\ EEI 
recommends that CISA consider scaling back this definition to cover 
only the most risky and impactful incidents. This also may help CISA 
prioritize resources and mitigations for those incidents that rise to a 
higher threshold.

2. Volume of Information Requested
    The proposed rule estimates CISA will receive 210,525 CIRCIA 
reports through 2033, at a cost of $1.2 billion for the Government and 
$1.4 billion for industry. Given the total number and cost of reports 
expected, EEI recommends that CISA reconsider the volume of information 
it is requesting from covered entities.
    As mentioned, the electricity subsector already is required to 
report cyber incidents through NERC, DOE, and the SEC. As the sector's 
statutorily designated Electric Reliability Organization and SRMA, 
respectively, NERC and DOE have the sector-specific expertise necessary 
to process the content of energy sector cyber incident reports. In 
contrast, a recent report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office 
found that CISA has insufficient staff with the requisite operational 
technology skills, including a lack of threat hunting and incident 
response expertise in the energy sector.\11\ Both CISA and industry 
would benefit from the development and implementation of reporting 
requirements that would result in the production of a manageable amount 
of information for all affected parties. To this end, it may be 
advisable for CISA to consider reviewing the type of information 
requested by NERC CIP-008-6 and OE-417, respectively, to help it 
formulate reporting requirements that are not unduly burdensome for

reporting requirements.

    EEI also has concerns with CISA's ability to obtain the resources 
necessary to triage the volume of information it proposes to request. 
The DHS fiscal year 2024 budget request included $98 million \12\ for 
CIRCIA for the staffing, processes, and technology necessary for 
successful implementation; however, the final fiscal year 2024 
appropriations package included just $73.9 million, $23 million below 
the request.\13\ Despite the $116 million requested for CIRCIA in 
fiscal year 2025, EEI remains concerned with CISA's ability to have the 
mechanisms in place to handle the information it is requesting from 
covered entities appropriately.\14\

3. Workforce Burden
    As this subcommittee has explored, the national cybersecurity 
workforce shortage is a major challenge across all critical 
infrastructure sectors. With more than 448,000 cybersecurity job 
openings in the United States, the energy sector is no exception to 
this challenge.\15\ The volume and content of the required CIRCIA 
reports will create a significant burden for the energy sector's 
cybersecurity workforce. EEI recommends CISA consider reducing this 
burden by prioritizing the implementation of interagency information-
sharing agreements and by ensuring submission requirements are similar 
to the industry's submission requirements for NERC CIP-008 and OE-417. 
A 2018 DOE Multiyear Plan for Energy Sector Cybersecurity found that 
Federal incident reporting guidelines were driven by compliance more 
than process improvement and that coordination among reporting 
mechanisms could be valuable.\16\ The need to focus on requirements 
that are outcome-based rather than compliance-based remains necessary 
to reduce the workforce burden of reporting multiple times to the 
Federal Government.

4. Data Preservation Requirements
    The proposed rule requires that, regardless of whether a covered 
entity submits a CIRCIA Report or is eligible for an exception from 
reporting, it must preserve data and records related to the covered 
incident or ransom payment for no less than 2 years from the date of 
submission or the date the submission would have been required. The 
proposed rule estimates data preservation costs to total more than $306 
million, which is the largest category of costs following the initial 
familiarization costs of implementation. EEI recommends that CISA 
consider reducing the proposed data-retention threshold to help ease 
costs and, instead, should allow those resources to be leveraged for 
security mitigation measures.
5. Protection of Information
    The current cyber threat landscape proves that no entity, public or 
private, is immune to cyber risk. In fact, CISA itself recently 
identified a threat actor's exploitation of two of its key systems, the 
Infrastructure Protection Gateway and Chemical Security Assessment 
Tool.\17\ Upon finalization and implementation of CISA's CIRCIA 
regulations, the cyber incident reporting information for all 16 
critical infrastructure sectors will be in the possession of one 
Federal agency, CISA, thereby making it an extremely attractive, high-
value target. Given this reality, it is imperative that any information 
entrusted to CISA be protected sufficiently from cyber threat actors.

                               conclusion
    Thank you again for holding this hearing. The electricity subsector 
and EEI's member companies are committed to advancing our strong 
cybersecurity posture and remain committed to working with both public 
and private partners across all sectors to comply with incident 
reporting requirements in a way that prioritizes and enhances critical 
infrastructure security. We appreciate the bipartisan support that 
cybersecurity legislation historically has enjoyed in this committee 
and the work that you have done to enhance the energy sector's 
cybersecurity posture. We look forward to working together to continue 
to bolster critical infrastructure security and resilience for the 
safety, security, and well-being of all Americans.

    Mr. Garbarino. Thank you, Mr. Aaronson.
    I now recognize Ms. Hogsett for 5 minutes to summarize her 
opening statement.

STATEMENT OF HEATHER HOGSETT, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, TECHNOLOGY 
       AND RISK STRATEGY FOR BITS, BANK POLICY INSTITUTE

    Ms. Hogsett. Thank you.
    Chairman Garborino, Ranking Member Swalwell, Chairman 
Green, honorable Members of the subcommittee, thank you for 
inviting me to testify.
    I'm Heather Hogsett, senior vice president of technology 
and risk strategy for BITS, the technology division of the Bank 
Policy Institute, or BPI.
    BPI is a nonpartisan policy, research, and advocacy 
organization representing the Nation's leading banks. Through 
our Technology Division, we work with our Members on cyber risk 
management, critical infrastructure protection, fraud 
reduction, regulations, and innovation.
    On behalf of BPI members, we greatly appreciate this 
committee's leadership and the opportunity to provide 
perspective on CISA's proposed rule to implement CIRCIA.
    The financial industry has been a strong supporter of 
sharing cyber threat and incident information for more than two 
decades and has experienced the value it provides.
    We were pleased to support CIRCIA as it was being 
considered by Congress because it sought to develop a uniform 
incident reporting standard across all major sectors of the 
economy and would provide CISA with information it needs to 
better understand cyber threats.
    While we continue to believe that CIRCIA will play an 
important role in our collective defense against nation-state 
attacks and cyber criminals, we urge CISA to substantially 
revise the proposed rule in several areas to ensure its 
requirements are simple, directly support CISA's ability to 
have awareness of significant cyber incident and to quickly 
share useful information with industry, and to allow cyber 
personnel to focus on response and recovery, rather than 
Government reporting.
    As currently drafted, this proposal will require extensive 
efforts by critical personnel during the most critical phase of 
an incident. When combined with a low threshold for reporting, 
this will add significant burden and compliance obligations.
    As CISA and this committee move forward, we offer several 
recommendations. CISA should refine its broad interpretation of 
the CIRCIA statute including definitions and data requirements. 
The definition of substantial cyber incident should be revised 
to ensure a higher threshold for reporting and avoid 
overreporting of incidents that cause minimal harm or impact.
    For instance, the requirement to report a disruption of a 
covered entity's ability to engage in business or industrial 
operations or deliver goods or services lacks an impact 
threshold and could lead to a large number of immaterial or 
less significant incidents being reported.
    CISA should also reduce the reporting requirements to those 
that support the goal of CIRCIA to quickly identify and assess 
risks across sectors and provide useful information to critical 
infrastructure entities to defend against attacks.
    When CIRCIA was enacted, Congress was careful to note that 
legislation sought to strike a balance between getting 
information quickly and letting victims respond to an attack 
without imposing burdensome requirements. The proposed rule 
would disrupt that balance by requiring entities to share 
sweeping investigative findings and details that are typically 
not available until weeks or months after an incident.
    For example, entities should not be required to report a 
time line of compromised system communications with other 
systems or an assessment of the effectiveness of response 
efforts.
    CISA should also focus on building the capability to 
leverage reported information for actionable purposes. CISA 
should ensure it is adequately equipped to intake incident 
reports and has the capabilities and subject-matter expertise 
to provide timely and actionable information back out to 
industry, along with tools, to help minimize or avoid threats.
    CISA should also clarify how it will protect this very 
sensitive information and how it will provide sector risk 
management agencies with information they need to fulfill their 
responsibilities and coordinate with entities in their 
respective sectors.
    Finally, we encourage Congress to continue to focus on 
regulatory harmonization. While we have seen progress in 
coordination on cyber incident notification by the prudential 
banking regulators, other independent regulators such as the 
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission have continued to issue rules that duplicate 
or conflict with CIRCIA.
    In particular, the SEC's cyber incident disclosure rule 
adds unnecessary complexity to incident response and undermines 
the purpose of CIRCIA by publicizing that a company has been 
attacked while CISA is still working to confidentially warn 
other potential victims and prevent further harm.
    We encourage Congress to explore legislative solutions to 
better facilitate harmonization efforts as this may be the most 
effective forcing function to achieve increased streamlining 
moving forward.
    In closing, we are committed to continuing to work with 
CISA and this committee to refine the proposed rule and ensure 
its successful implementation. If its requirements are balanced 
appropriately, CIRCIA will help reduce attacks and the 
disruption they cause to individuals, businesses, our economy, 
and our way of life.
    Thank you for opportunity to speak today, and I'm happy to 
answer any questions.

                 Prepared Statement of Heather Hogsett
                              May 1, 2024
    Chairman Garbarino, Ranking Member Swalwell, and Honorable Members 
of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to testify. I am Heather 
Hogsett, senior vice president of technology and risk strategy for 
BITS, the technology policy division of the Bank Policy Institute.
    BPI is a nonpartisan policy, research, and advocacy organization 
representing the Nation's leading banks. BPI members include universal 
banks, regional banks and major foreign banks doing business in the 
United States. BITS, our technology policy division, works with our 
member banks as well as insurance, card companies, and market utilities 
on cyber risk management and critical infrastructure protection, fraud 
reduction, regulation, and innovation.
    I also serve as co-chair of the Financial Services Sector 
Coordinating Council Policy Committee. The FSSCC coordinates across the 
financial sector to enhance security and resiliency and to collaborate 
with Government partners such as the U.S. Treasury and the 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, as well as financial 
regulatory agencies.
    On behalf of BPI member companies, I appreciate the opportunity to 
provide feedback today on CISA's notice of proposed rulemaking to 
implement the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act 
of 2022. We were pleased to support CIRCIA as it was being considered 
by Congress because it sought to develop a uniform incident reporting 
standard across all major sectors of the economy and would provide CISA 
with information it needs to better defend against attacks.
    While we continue to believe that CIRCIA will play an important 
role in our collective defense against nation-state attacks and 
malicious criminals, we urge CISA to substantially revise the proposed 
rule in several key areas to ensure its requirements are simple and 
directly support CISA's ability to have better awareness of significant 
cyber incidents; to quickly provide useful information to critical 
infrastructure; and to allow cyber personnel to focus on response and 
recovery rather than Government reporting.
    As currently drafted, this proposal will require extensive efforts 
by critical personnel during the most critical phase of an incident and 
includes expectations for on-going updates. When combined with a low 
threshold for reporting and other existing regulatory reporting 
requirements, this will add significant burden and compliance 
obligations.
    BPI is working with our member companies and several other 
financial trade associations to provide a detailed response that I will 
be happy to share with this committee once it is complete. In the 
interim, I would highlight that we believe CISA took an overly broad 
approach and expanded certain areas well beyond the statute. We offer 
the following concerns and recommendations:
    (1) CISA should refine its broad interpretation of the CIRCIA 
        statute. CISA should apply a higher threshold for incidents 
        that must be reported to better focus on significant cyber 
        threats. It should also reduce the reporting elements to those 
        that support CIRCIA's goal to quickly identify and assess risks 
        across sectors and disseminate early alerts and mitigation 
        measures where possible.
    (2) CISA should focus on building the capability to leverage 
        reported information for actionable purposes. CISA should 
        ensure it is adequately equipped to intake incident reports and 
        has the capabilities and subject-matter expertise to provide 
        timely and actionable information back out to industry along 
        with tools to help minimize or avoid threats. CISA should also 
        clarify how it will protect this information and provide Sector 
        Risk Management Agencies with information they need to fulfill 
        their responsibilities and coordinate with entities in their 
        sector.
    (3) Congress should continue to focus on regulatory harmonization. 
        While we have seen progress in coordination on cyber incident 
        notification by the prudential banking regulators, other 
        independent regulators continue to issue rules that duplicate 
        or conflict with CIRCIA. In particular, the SEC's cyber 
        incident disclosure rule adds unnecessary complexity to 
        incident response and undermines the purpose of CIRCIA by 
        publicizing that a company has been attacked while CISA is 
        still working to warn other potential victims and prevent 
        further harm.
       cyber incident information sharing in the financial sector
    Financial institutions are often targeted by hostile nation-state 
cyber actors and criminal organizations seeking to disrupt the 
financial system and overall functioning of the U.S. economy. As a 
critical infrastructure sector, the financial services industry has 
acknowledged the severity of these risks and invested significant 
resources over more than 2 decades to enhance or otherwise support 
cyber information-sharing efforts and incident response coordination.
    The formation of the FSSCC and Financial Services Information 
Sharing and Analysis Center were both key elements in these efforts. 
The FSSCC strengthens the resiliency of the financial services sector 
by proactively identifying cyber threats, driving preparedness and 
coordinating crisis response.\1\ The FS-ISAC shares cyber threat 
information and best practices with roughly 5,000 members in 70 
different countries.\2\ Each organization strengthens public-private 
cooperation through trusted, confidential forums that enable detailed 
information sharing and serve as a model other critical infrastructure 
sectors have sought to emulate.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In addition to these 2 settings, BPI members supported regulatory 
efforts to ensure timely awareness of significant cybersecurity threats 
facing financial institutions or critical infrastructure more broadly. 
The prudential banking regulators' Computer-Security Incident 
Notification Rule \3\ is an example of this. That rule allows 
institutions that have suffered a potentially significant incident to 
satisfy their compliance obligations by notifying their primary 
regulator--either the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency or the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation--via a simple email or telephone call within 36 hours. This 
requirement balances regulators' need for early awareness of 
significant cyber threats without diverting critical resources at 
affected entities who need to effectively respond.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    BPI members were also broadly supportive of CIRCIA while it was 
being negotiated in Congress and leading up to its enactment in March 
2022.\4\ As a regularly-targeted critical infrastructure sector, we 
shared policy makers' view that the proliferation of cyber incidents 
represents a critical economic and national security threat. To that 
end, banks and other financial institutions believed CIRCIA was a 
unique opportunity to expand visibility, awareness, and coordinated 
sharing of incident information across all critical infrastructure 
sectors to combat sophisticated and persistent cyber threats.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                financial services regulatory landscape
    For CIRCIA to be effective, however, it is important that CISA 
acknowledges existing regulatory requirements and harmonizes those with 
CIRCIA wherever possible. As the Cyber Incident Reporting Council's 
report commissioned by CIRCIA identified, there are 8 distinct cyber 
incident reporting requirements applicable to the financial sector 
alone.\5\ Financial institutions are also subject to rigorous 
supervision and examinations to determine whether they operate in a 
safe and sound manner. This includes on-site examiners evaluating 
compliance with relevant statutory requirements and whether firms 
implement appropriate security controls, including third-party risk 
management, operational risk and resiliency programs, and oversight by 
the board of directors.

    The recent adoption of the SEC's public company disclosure \6\ rule 
adds to this already complex regulatory landscape. As BPI and many 
industry stakeholders have pointed out,\7\ the SEC's rule conflicts 
with the primary purpose of confidential reporting requirements like 
CIRCIA, creates confusion and diverts resources from critical response 
and recovery activities. Requiring public disclosure--particularly of 
on-going incidents--puts sensitive information into the hands of 
hostile threat actors while shortening the time frame agencies like 
CISA will have to warn other potential victims. In the first few months 
since the rule went into effect, we've seen malicious actors even turn 
the disclosure requirement into an additional extortion method used 
against victim companies.\8\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          implementing circia
    Successful implementation of CIRCIA will provide several important 
benefits to our national cyber defense. If calibrated and implemented 
appropriately, CIRCIA will provide CISA with more information from 
across critical infrastructure sectors to enhance its analysis and 
assessment of emerging cyber threats. This in turn will improve the 
quality of the alerts and security services offered by CISA and other 
government partners and provide earlier warning to potentially affected 
companies so they can better protect themselves.
    CIRCIA will also provide greater insight into the threats facing 
third parties and other service providers. Like financial institutions, 
threat actors have frequently targeted these entities in recent years 
and the proposed rule acknowledges how the compromise of a third-party 
service provider can ``cause significant cascading impacts to tens, 
hundreds, or even thousands of other entities.'' Consistent incident 
reporting from those entities will provide CISA with a more complete 
picture of the cyber threat landscape and will also help third-party 
providers enhance their own incident management processes.
    Benefits notwithstanding, implementing CIRCIA will be a challenge. 
As noted in the CIRC Report, there are 45 in-effect reporting 
requirements administered by 22 Federal agencies--many of which have 
different definitions and thresholds for reporting.\9\ Rather than 
implementing the CIRC report's recommendation to adopt a more uniform 
definition and threshold for a reportable cyber incident, CISA's 
proposed substantial cyber incident definition adds another broad term 
with a reporting threshold well below many other existing requirements. 
Streamlining those requirements is no trivial task given the divergent 
missions and authorities of those Federal agencies--however, CISA's 
narrow interpretation of the ``substantially similar'' exemption under 
CIRCIA will render it unusable. As a result, entities will likely have 
to continue to simultaneously assess compliance with multiple 
notification, reporting, and disclosure obligations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\ Id. at 4-5.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    There is also the challenge of getting some independent regulatory 
agencies to engage and support broader harmonization efforts. For 
example, the SEC first proposed its public company disclosure rule just 
8 days after the Senate passed CIRCIA. Since then, the SEC rule has 
created uncertainties around what cyber threat and incident information 
can be shared between private-sector entities and has been used as an 
additional extortion method by ransomware criminals--all for the 
attenuated benefit of informing investor decision making. This past 
January, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission also proposed a new 
rule on operational resilience that would require reporting of cyber 
incidents within 24 hours.\10\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    CISA's 447-page NPRM is in many ways a reflection of how 
challenging it is to bring coherence to the fragmented cyber regulatory 
landscape. Articulating a definition for covered entity across 16 
critical infrastructure sectors is not a straightforward exercise. At 
the same time though, the required data elements CISA proposes for 
CIRCIA reporting are expansive and, in several instances, well beyond 
what was contemplated by the underlying statute. For example, the rule 
proposes to require firms to report detailed investigative findings 
such as the ``time line of compromised system communications with other 
systems''\11\ as well as ``a description of any unauthorized access, 
regardless of whether the covered cyber incident involved an attributed 
or unattributed cyber intrusion, identification of any informational 
impacts or information compromise, and any network location where 
activity was observed.''\12\ The NPRM also proposes that reports 
include the ``direct economic impacts to operations''\13\ and even an 
``assessment of the effectiveness of response efforts in mitigating and 
responding to the covered cyber incident.''\14\ These requirements are 
broader than those contained in the CIRCIA statute and, as discussed 
above, will make it difficult if not impossible to leverage a report 
provided to another Federal agency under the ``substantially similar'' 
reporting exemption.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Given the breadth and detail of the proposed reporting elements--
several of which are typically unknown prior to the 72-hour reporting 
deadline--CIRCIA's supplemental reporting requirements would likewise 
become more burdensome than Congress intended. Because CISA interprets 
``substantial new or different information'' as anything responsive to 
a required data field in a CIRCIA report, it is likely that an impacted 
entity will have to provide numerous supplemental reports during a 
single incident response. If not balanced appropriately, outsized 
compliance demands can create operational risks by consuming the time 
of front-line cyber personnel on reporting requirements instead of on 
network and enterprise security operations.
    The proposed data elements are also relevant for another important 
aspect of CIRCIA's implementation--CISA's capability to intake reported 
information and provide timely and useful alerts back out to 
potentially impacted entities. This includes providing clarity for how 
CISA will share reported information with Sector Risk Management 
Agencies and other law enforcement partners. Equally important will be 
how CISA protects this very sensitive information once submitted as it 
will quickly become a target for attackers and could put covered 
entities at risk if breached. In the final rule, CISA should carefully 
calibrate the information required in CIRCIA reports with its own 
ability to leverage that information in furtherance of some actionable 
purpose. As currently constructed, the proposed rule requires 
information beyond CISA's direct statutory mandate and above what is 
necessary ``to enhance situational awareness of cyber threats across 
critical infrastructure sectors.''1515 6 U.S.C.  681a(a).
                            recommendations
    As noted above, BPI is working on a comprehensive response to the 
CIRCIA NPRM. Based on our discussions with banks and other financial 
institutions thus far, we offer 3 recommendations for CISA and the 
committee's consideration:
    (1) CISA should refine its broad interpretation of the CIRCIA 
        statute.--CISA should revise the definition of ``substantial 
        cyber incident'' to ensure a higher threshold for reporting and 
        avoid over-reporting of incidents that cause minimal harm or 
        impact. For instance, the requirement to report a ``disruption 
        of a covered entity's ability to engage in business or 
        industrial operations, or deliver goods or services'' lacks an 
        impact threshold and could lead to a large number of immaterial 
        or less significant incidents being reported. The CIRCIA 
        statute had additional language for this prong referencing 
        disruptions to business or industrial operations ``including 
        due to a denial of service attack, ransomware attack, or 
        exploitation of a zero day vulnerability.''\16\ While Congress 
        may not have intended to limit this threshold exclusively to 
        those 3 scenarios, it does indicate a specific operational 
        disruption much narrower than the one outlined in the proposed 
        rule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \16\ 6 U.S.C.  681b(c)(2)(ii).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    CISA should also reduce the reporting requirements to information 
        that supports CIRCIA's goal to allow CISA to quickly identify 
        and assess risks across sectors and provide early alerts and 
        mitigation measures where possible. Covered entities should not 
        be required to share sweeping investigative findings or details 
        that are often not available until weeks or months after an 
        incident.
    In its proposed rule, CISA interprets the CIRCIA statute well 
        beyond Congress's intent that CIRCIA promote ``shared awareness 
        of the cyber threats across the public and private 
        sectors''\17\ and not become a large-scale data collection 
        exercise. For example, CISA acknowledges that the data elements 
        proposed for CIRCIA reports exceed those specified by Congress 
        in the statute. In fact, CISA's proposal outlines a level of 
        granularity never seen before in incident reporting regimes and 
        will make harmonizing cyber incident reports across Federal

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    To fulfill its goal of better awareness of cyber threats across 
        critical infrastructure sectors, Congress recognized CISA would 
        need to be notified of substantial incidents within a 
        relatively short time frame--hence the 72-hour reporting 
        requirement. Nevertheless, when CIRCIA was enacted, Congress 
        was careful to note the legislation sought to strike ``a 
        balance between getting information quickly and letting victims 
        respond to an attack without imposing burdensome 
        requirements.''\18\ CISA's proposed rule would disrupt that 
        balance by requiring information that is often unknown within 
        72 hours and as a result significantly increasing supplemental 
        reporting demands.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    (2) CISA should focus on building the capability to leverage 
        reported information for actionable purposes.--CISA estimates 
        that over 316,000 companies will be considered covered entities 
        under the final rule. When combined with the breadth of the 
        proposed substantial cyber incident definition, CISA is likely 
        to receive far more than the 15,000 annual incident reports it 
        now anticipates. If CISA is to preserve its productive and 
        collaborative relationship with the private sector, it is 
        critical to assemble the necessary infrastructure, staff, and 
        communication channels to analyze and disseminate actionable 
        cyber threat information to potentially impacted entities.
    It is also vital that CISA clearly articulate a process that will 
        allow SRMAs, including the U.S. Treasury Department, to quickly 
        be notified of an incident and to access information the SRMA 
        may need to coordinate response efforts within their respective 
        sectors. The financial services sector has a strong and 
        collaborative relationship with Treasury that includes incident 
        response playbooks and a communication plan. Both of these 
        include coordination with regulators and interconnect with 
        other national response mechanisms. The sector has experienced 
        several ransomware attacks in the last year that impacted the 
        sector to varying degrees. In each instance, Treasury played a 
        vital role in the early stages by working with firms and 
        regulators to assess impacts and potential downstream effects. 
        Critical in this coordination is Treasury's ability to quickly 
        access incident information while avoiding the need for various 
        Government agencies to contact the affected entity. CISA should 
        clarify how this process will work once CIRCIA reporting is in 
        place and how it will preserve and support the role of SRMAs.
    (3) Congress should continue to focus on regulatory 
        harmonization.--With CIRCIA, Congress took an important step 
        toward establishing a harmonized cyber incident reporting 
        standard across critical infrastructure. In 2023, the Biden 
        administration similarly identified harmonizing and 
        streamlining existing regulation as a strategic priority in its 
        National Cybersecurity Strategy,\19\ and the CIRC issued its 
        report on harmonization with several recommendations for 
        Congressional action.\20\

    \20\ DEP'T OF HOMELAND SEC., HARMONIZATION OF CYBER INCIDENT 
REPORTING TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 34 (2023).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Despite these efforts, independent regulators like the SEC and CFTC 
continue to offer their own disparate standards for incident reporting 
which will contribute to growing burnout and attrition among key 
cybersecurity personnel. According to a recent survey of large 
financial institutions, Chief Information Security Officers report 
spending between 30 to upwards of 50 percent of their time on 
regulatory compliance, with several firms noting that their security 
teams spend more than 70 percent of their time on compliance 
activities. As regulations continue to expand in number and scope, 
cybersecurity teams will have less time to adjust to rapid 
technological change. This presents considerable operational risk--
particularly as hostile actors move to weaponize emerging technologies 
like artificial intelligence and quantum computing.
    With that being the case, we encourage Congress to explore 
legislative solutions to further harmonization efforts. The CIRC 
report's recommendation that Congress remove any barriers to 
harmonization and drive adoption of model definitions, time lines, and 
thresholds for cyber incident reporting \21\ could be beneficial if 
applied across all Federal agencies to include independent regulatory 
agencies. It is vital that Congress make clear to regulators that they 
must recognize existing Federal requirements and leverage the CIRCIA 
reports, rather than continue to issue new incident reporting 
requirements. This may be the most effective forcing function to 
achieve increased streamlining moving forward.

                               conclusion
    The financial services sector has long supported the early and 
confidential sharing of cyber threat and incident information. Early 
awareness of threats helps firms respond and calibrate additional 
security measures that can prevent malicious activity or minimize its 
impact. CIRCIA represents an important step toward expanding this type 
of awareness and information sharing across all critical infrastructure 
sectors. If its requirements are appropriately balanced, CIRCIA will 
help reduce attacks and the disruption they cause to individuals, 
businesses, our economy, and our way of life.
    It is imperative that we work together to ensure the final 
reporting requirements of CIRCIA balance CISA's needs for early 
incident information while not disrupting critical incident response 
and remediation activities. As currently drafted, CIRCIA would add 
significant requirements to an already challenging and complex set of 
Government reporting requirements. It will also overwhelm CISA with 
information that is not needed or useful to fulfill the goals of better 
situational awareness and timely information sharing with critical 
infrastructure.
    We are committed to continuing to work with CISA and this committee 
to refine the proposed rule and ensure its successful implementation.

    Mr. Garbarino. Thank you, Ms. Hogsett.
    I now recognize Mr. Mayer for 5 minutes to summarize his 
opening statement.

STATEMENT OF ROBERT MAYER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, CYBERSECURITY 
     AND INNOVATION, US TELECOM, THE BROADBAND ASSOCIATION

    Mr. Mayer. Chairman Garbarino, Ranking Member Swalwell, 
honorable Members of the subcommittee, thank you for convening 
this hearing on implementation of the CISA Cyber Incident 
Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act, CIRCIA, perhaps the 
most important of the foundational cybersecurity-related 
statutes Congress has passed.
    My name is Robert Mayer. I'm senior vice president of 
cybersecurity and innovation at USTelecom. Our members include 
broadband providers, suppliers, and technology innovators, all 
providing advanced and secure communication services to markets 
urban and rural and everywhere in between.
    In addition to my role at USTelecom, I serve as the chair 
of the Communications Sector Coordinating Council and co-chair 
of the DHS ICT Supply Chain Risk Management Task Force, the two 
principal organizations that serve as the Government's industry 
partners for developing cybersecurity and supply chain security 
policies.
    Thank you for holding this hearing today. It is absolutely 
crucial to our national security that CISA critical 
infrastructure entities and other Government agencies work 
collaboratively with this subcommittee to implement Congress' 
vision for this law.
    Our members have a long history of successful collaboration 
with U.S. Government partners, dating back the Cuban Missile 
Crisis when the U.S. Government formed a critical alliance with 
the telecommunications industry to ensure its survival in the 
event of a nuclear attack. That collaboration continues today 
as USTelecom works regularly with Government partners like 
NIST, CISA, the intelligence community, DOD, and other valued 
partners.
    Unfortunately, parts of our Government risk undermining 
this collaboration as we increasingly see a regulatory mindset 
focused on prescriptive compliance rather than dynamic 
teamwork. This manifested last week in the FCC's misguided 
order that will impose 20th-Century utility-based prescriptive 
regulations on internet service providers including in the 
realm of cybersecurity where other agencies such as CISA are 
the ones with the appropriate expertise.
    To be clear, CIRCIA implementation is an enormous task. 
CISA estimates that 300,000 entities will be covered by its 
requirements and it will take years of multiple iterative 
exchanges between Government and critical infrastructure 
entities to fully mature.
    There are several areas in particular that we believe need 
our collective attention. For one, we need clarity on the terms 
and definitions in the rule. The proposed scope of covered 
entities and covered cyber incidents are expansive and 
currently lack key guidance that cybersecurity practitioners 
and the attorneys will need.
    Without more precise definitions and clear reporting 
thresholds, overreporting will occur and could overwhelm 
Government resources and undermine the effectiveness of CIRCIA. 
We should avoid unproductive and disproportionate focus on 
routine events in favor of reporting cyber incidents that 
pertain directly to CISA's mission.
    Moreover, it is imperative for our Government partners to 
recognize the substantial cyber resources that will be 
allocated to assess whether an event meets the reporting 
criteria and fulfill the expansive set of reporting 
requirements.
    It's also important to underscore that CIRCIA partnership 
implies reciprocity. To fulfill CIRCIA's purpose, CISA needs to 
establish mechanisms of rapidly disseminating valuable 
defensive advisories to critical infrastructure entities while 
also supporting victims as they respond to highly debilitating 
attacks.
    It is also vital that we achieve harmonization and 
efficiency in reporting. Our members from the smallest to the 
largest have expressed concern about the substantial resources 
they will need to dedicate to complying with a rapidly growing 
patchwork of incident reporting requirements.
    Our ask from the Federal Government partners is this. 
Providers need to be able to submit reports through a single 
agency. It will be essential to streamline the contents of 
reports as much as possible, by developing a common format, 
while allowing a variety of flexible reporting mechanisms that 
could ideally be tailored to the unique needs of organizations.
    Finally, we call on CISA to establish ex parte 
communications for the CIRCIA rulemaking. This is a critical 
step in the spirit of collaboration toward ensuring a robust 
framework that reflects the intricate realities of 
cybersecurity and critical infrastructure sectors.
    Agency adoption of a transparent and open process akin to 
that employed by other Government agencies will facilitate 
continuous and meaningful input from industry stakeholders 
whose expertise and first-hand experience are invaluable for 
crafting policies that are not only effective but also 
practical.
    Deep and persistent collaboration is the key to achieving 
Congressional intent in implementing CIRCIA. USTelecom and its 
members will continue to work closely with CISA through the 
Comm Sector Coordinating Council and other fora and by actively 
participating in the CIRCIA rulemaking process. We look forward 
to continued successful collaborations to combat the ever-
evolving cyber threats we face.
    I look forward to your questions.
    Mr. Garbarino. Thank----
    Mr. Mayer. Thank you.

                   Prepared Statement of Robert Mayer
                              May 1, 2024
    Chairman Andrew Garbarino, Ranking Member Eric Swalwell, Members of 
the subcommittee, thank you for convening this hearing on 
implementation of the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical 
Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA), perhaps the most important of the 
foundational cybersecurity-related statutes Congress has passed. My 
name is Robert Mayer, and I am the senior vice president, cybersecurity 
and innovation at USTelecom and serve as the chair of the 
Communications Sector Coordinating Council and co-chair of the DHS ICT 
Supply Chain Risk Management Task Force.
    It is absolutely crucial to our national security that CISA, 
critical infrastructure entities, and other Government agencies work 
collaboratively to implement Congress's vision for this law--to deepen 
and operationalize the partnership between Government and industry that 
is indispensable to our defense against cyber threats.
    As this subcommittee is well aware, the United States' 
adversaries--China, Russia, Iran, North Korea--are increasingly 
becoming an aggressive military alliance, and those governments and 
their criminal proxies have extremely sophisticated cyber capabilities. 
We need close and well-coordinated teamwork between Government and 
industry to ensure our defense.
    CIRCIA can be a profoundly powerful tool in deepening this 
collaboration and teamwork, and I implore the subcommittee to push this 
principle relentlessly in the years to come.
    Unfortunately, parts of our Government risk undermining this 
principle, as we increasingly see a rigid regulatory mindset focused on 
prescriptive compliance rather than dynamic teamwork. This manifested 
last week in the FCC's misguided order that will impose 20th Century 
utility-based prescriptive regulations on Internet Service Providers--
including even in the realm of cybersecurity--which are investing 
billions of dollars to innovate for the 21st Century.
    As the most dynamic and innovative nation in history, we need to 
recognize that our defense against these threats requires us to deepen 
our collaboration. We need to double down on, not undermine, the 
Government-industry partnership. At this very moment, and literally 
every moment, experts in Government and private industry are working 
shoulder to shoulder to outwit and outpace highly-organized efforts to 
infiltrate our Nation's critical infrastructure. That is the only 
approach that will work.
    Thankfully, the launch of CIRCIA can help get this right, because 
CIRCIA--if properly implemented--is fundamentally about collaboration 
and holistic situational awareness. Now, it is incumbent on Government 
and industry partners to roll up our sleeves and collectively begin the 
work of translating Congress's directions into operational reality.
    To be clear, CIRCIA implementation is an enormous task--CISA 
estimates that 300,000 entities will be covered by its requirements--
and it will take years and multiple iterative exchanges between 
Government and critical infrastructure entities to fully mature. Here 
again, the more collaboration and partnership we practice, the more we 
can develop mutual understanding and expectations of what is needed and 
how to achieve it.
    There are several areas in particular that we believe need our 
collective attention.
    For one, we need clarity on the terms and definitions in the rule. 
Without sufficient specificity, this is difficult to accomplish. The 
proposed scope of ``covered entities'' and ``covered cyber incident'' 
are expansive and currently lack key guidance that cybersecurity 
practitioners will need, as they seek to provide CISA with information 
that is responsive to the agency's mission.
    Moreover, it is imperative for our Government partners to recognize 
the substantial cyber resources that will be allocated to assess 
whether an event meets the reporting criteria. The industry requires 
more precise definitions and clear reporting thresholds. Without these, 
there is a real risk that, in an effort to comply with the law, the 
industry will report numerous events that could easily overwhelm CISA's 
capacity to act on the information. Such overreporting could 
unnecessarily burden Government resources and undermine the 
effectiveness of CIRCIA. It is crucial to establish definitions that 
are not excessively broad, as overly inclusive terms could divert 
essential resources away from cyber defense and toward regulatory 
compliance for its own sake.
    Critically, we believe that covered cyber incidents should only be 
those pertaining directly to the mission of CISA and avoid unproductive 
and disproportionate focus on routine events.
    It is also important to underscore that partnership implies 
reciprocity. To fulfill CIRCIA's purpose, CISA needs to establish 
mechanisms of rapidly disseminating valuable defensive advisories to 
critical infrastructure entities while also supporting victims as they 
respond to highly debilitating attacks.
    The estimated cost to industry of these new requirements is $1.4 
billion over 11 years, and it is estimated the Federal Government will 
incur costs of $1.2 billion over the same time frame. Collectively, our 
Nation needs a return on this investment and for the law to achieve its 
aims. We will work with CISA to ensure that meaningful incident reports 
lead to broader situational awareness and to increased operational 
preparedness and response capabilities.
    It is also vital that we achieve harmonization and efficiency in 
reporting. Our members, from the smallest to the largest, have 
expressed concern about the substantial resources they will need to 
dedicate to complying with a rapidly-growing patchwork of incident 
reporting requirements. Our ask from Federal Government partners is 
this: Providers need to be able to submit reports to a single agency. 
It will be essential to streamline the contents of reports as much as 
possible--by developing a common format--while allowing a variety of 
flexible reporting mechanisms that could ideally be tailored to the 
unique needs of organizations.
    Finally, we call on CISA to establish ex parte communications for 
the CIRCIA rulemaking. This is a critical step toward ensuring a robust 
regulatory framework that reflects the intricate realities of 
cybersecurity in critical infrastructure sectors. As CISA now possesses 
enhanced regulatory powers, it is imperative that the agency adopts a 
transparent and open process akin to that employed by other regulatory 
bodies. This approach will facilitate continuous and meaningful input 
from industry stakeholders, whose expertise and first-hand experience 
are invaluable for creating regulations that are not only effective but 
also practical.
    Such a process would not only enhance the quality and applicability 
of the regulatory outcomes but also bolster the credibility and 
trustworthiness of CISA as a regulatory authority in the eyes of the 
industries it regulates.
    Deep and persistent collaboration is the key to achieving 
Congress's intent in implementing CIRCIA, and USTelecom and its members 
will continue to work closely with CISA, our sector risk management 
agency, through the Communications Sector Coordinating Council and 
other fora, and by actively participating in the CIRCIA rulemaking 
process. For decades, we have engaged consistently with CISA, its 
predecessors, and other Government agencies to provide information 
about cyber threats and to advance law enforcement investigations, and 
we will continue to deepen and evolve that practice.
    We seek the Government's continuing partnership in making that a 
reality. I look forward to your questions.

    Mr. Garbarino. Thank you, Mr. Mayer.
    I now recognize Ms. Elazari for 5 minutes to summarize her 
opening statement.

  STATEMENT OF AMIT ELAZARI, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, OPEN POLICY 
                             GROUP

    Ms. Elazari. Chairman Green, Chairman Garbarino, Ranking 
Member Swalwell, Members of the subcommittee, on behalf of 
OpenPolicy and our community of innovative companies, thank you 
for the opportunity to testify today on the implementation of 
CIRCIA.
    My name is Dr. Amit Elazari, and I'm the CEO and cofounder 
of OpenPolicy. We are the world's first technology platform for 
policy intelligence and engagement, making Government affairs 
and policy more accessible to entities of all sizes.
    OpenPolicy represents leading entrepreneurial companies, 
innovators that create cutting-edge security solutions that 
protect critical infrastructure and Federal agencies. 
OpenPolicy itself is a small business, a startup, and perhaps 
the smallest among the IT Sector Coordinating Council members.
    Members of the subcommittee, at the time when threats to 
our Nation have never been more profound and the consequences 
have never been higher, many businesses and organizations still 
stand defenseless against persistent and advanced attacks. 
These threats advanced with AI. We are in an arms race against 
the adversaries, and they have an asymmetric advantage. They 
already have the information.
    Winning in this race or merely keeping ahead, keeping pace 
requires more than just information. It requires reducing our 
collective risk. It requires achieving cyber resilience. This 
is one of the key goals of CIRCIA.
    CIRCIA is one of the most comprehensive cyber laws passed 
in decades. It holds a great promise to reduce risk if 
implemented properly. If not, we risk a lot. Our colleagues 
have already spoken about this.
    For small businesses, we actually risk increasing the cyber 
risk. This is because we have a small amount of firefighters, 
defenders, and we can overwhelm them with these requests. With 
billions in potential costs for both Government agencies and 
critical infrastructure entities, we need to get this right.
    The communicative cost of this expanded scope we talked 
about, covered entities, covered incidents, needs to be met 
with a broader value-for-risk reduction. This entails action 
within CIRCIA and beyond it. Significant infrastructure 
investments, we talked about common architecture, common 
technologies, common forms.
    We need to be giving back to those entities. We need to 
make sure that we take all those reports in and use the state-
of-the-art technology to really get those insights and move 
from prevention to mitigation.
    In the context of the CIRCIA rule, we are focusing on a few 
more recommendations. First of all, I talked about technology 
and infrastructure. The common framework to work between 
agencies needs to rely on the cutting elementary solutions. 
This is because only with AI we will be able to deduct the most 
important insights from all this information coming in and 
actually move toward resilience and mitigation.
    We need to align the findings that we're getting from the 
indicators with other programs that are investing within 
agencies and critical infrastructures like CDM. If the threats 
are coming from OT, from OT infrastructure, this needs to be a 
priority across the board.
    This type of reflection must also look at harmonization, 
and my colleagues already talked extensively about that. I'm 
going to bring forth one concrete recommendation.
    The DOD, the DIB has a large population of small entities. 
We estimate about 20 percent of all impacted entities with the 
current scope within DOD. The CIRCIA agreement with DOD, 
getting that aligned with the different clients, this must be a 
priority. We will need Congress' support and oversight with 
this priority.
    My colleague, he already talked about ex parte. In the next 
15 months after the comment period extension, the landscape 
will change. An ex parte process would ensure we get feedback 
from all stakeholders involved as the threat landscape evolves 
in a way that is transparent. CISA can bring a model that is 
building on the FCC or the copyright office there to ensure ex 
parte communication.
    We have an opportunity to lead in this race. Proper 
implementation of CIRCIA can yield significant progress. Your 
support and oversight is essential. There could be additional 
measures. We must focus on technology solutions and 
infrastructure.
    We appreciate the time and the ability to share comments 
with you and stand ready to collaborate with you.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify, and I welcome 
your questions.

on the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act or 
(CIRCIA).\1\ We appreciate your leadership in supporting the passage of

117-263 (Dec. 23, 2022).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    At a time when threats to our Nation have never been more profound, 
and the consequences for human lives, critical infrastructure, and the 
foundational institutions on which we rely, have never been more 
prominent, the majority of businesses and critical infrastructure 
providers still stand defenseless against persistent and existential 
cyber threats. These threats have only expanded with the advancement of 
AI; the convergence of operational technology (OT), IoT, and IT 
systems; and the growing sophistication of adversaries.
    CIRCIA, perhaps the most comprehensive legislative action on 
cybersecurity in decades, presents a critical opportunity to increase 
the Government's situational awareness, reduce cyber risk, and move us 
collectively forward in the endless asymmetric fight against 
adversaries seeking to undermine U.S. national and economic security.
    But, as I must emphasize--only if implemented properly.
    My name is Amit Elazari, and I am the CEO and co-founder of 
OpenPolicy, a small business and technology company (otherwise known as 
a ``startup''). I'm also the former head of cybersecurity policy at 
Intel Corporation, served as chair of the Cyber Committee of the 
Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), and was a member of the 
IT-Sector Coordinating Council (SCC) executive committee.
    In addition to my current role, I teach at the University of 
California at Berkeley in the Master in Information and Cybersecurity 
Program and serve as an advisor to the UC Berkeley Center for Long-Term 
Cybersecurity. I also co-founded Disclose.io, whose body of work 
related to establishing authorization for third-party ``good faith'' 
security research (ethical, or ``friendly'' hacking) is referred to in 
the CIRCIA proposed implementing rule (``Rule'' or NPRM'').
    In my capacity as a cyber policy expert, I engaged extensively in 
the stakeholder process as CIRCIA was drafted, and am now actively 
engaged in the rulemaking process. Today, I'm honored to share my 
views, and the view of the OpenPolicy community, on the progress made 
regarding CIRCIA implementation and the proposed rule.
    By way of background, OpenPolicy \2\ is the world's first policy 
intelligence and engagement technology platform, aiming to democratize 
access to the policy-making process for entities of all sizes by 
leveraging AI. OpenPolicy is a small business and perhaps the smallest 
member of the IT Sector Coordinating Council.

    OpenPolicy collaborates with and represents leading innovators that 
develop cutting-edge technologies to enhance cybersecurity and protect 
critical infrastructure. OpenPolicy members include some of the world's 
leading AI, IoT, and botnet prevention security companies such as 
Armis, Human Security, FiniteState, HiddenLayer, Kiteworks, Cranium AI, 
and more. Our members' solutions are used extensively by the critical 
infrastructure community and among Federal agencies to protect against 
malicious attacks.
    My testimony identifies concrete policy recommendations that seek 
to align the Rule and CISA's implementation process with Congressional 
intent. I also want to highlight the Rule's impact on small businesses. 
This committee is right to reflect on the implementation of CIRCIA, 
given its mandate, and also because of changes in the policy landscape, 
technology itself, and the threat landscape since both CIRCIA's 
enactment and the RFI release. OpenPolicy applauds you for facilitating 
this discussion.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ CIRCIA requires covered entities to report to CISA-covered 
cyber incidents within 72 hours after the covered entity reasonably 
believes that the covered cyber incident has occurred and ransom 
payments made in response to a ransomware attack within 24 hours after 
the ransom payment has been made. See 6 U.S.C. 681b(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               background
    Recent events underscore the urgent need to strengthen national 
security and defense, and the opportunity CIRCIA has to advance 
Government situational cyber awareness.
    The promise CIRCIA holds relies on the ability of CISA to quickly 
intake reports, allocate resources, and provide support to entities 
affected by cyber incidents. CISA seeks to identify trends and swiftly 
disseminate this information to network defenders. Such proactive 
sharing will help alert other potential targets about emerging and 
existing threats and ideally prevent them from succumbing to similar 
attacks.
    This use of information from the time an incident is reported, in 
support of immediate remediation but also to further longer-term 
prevention--is what CIRCIA aims to achieve and is meant to enhance our 
collective security. Congress intended for CIRCIA to not only improve 
Government awareness of cyber incidents but also to enhance security 
resilience throughout the entire ecosystem and ultimately advance risk 
reduction.
    The effectiveness of CIRCIA and its underlying regulations should 
be measured not only by how efficiently information from reported cyber 
incidents is examined, enriched, and transferred, but also by how that 
information is leveraged to improve the security of the entire 
ecosystem, i.e., in a manner proportional to the cost (estimated in 
$U.S. billions). Achieving this goal will entail a unified Federal 
policy for leveraging the reported information to increase cyber 
resilience. This will require actions that extend beyond CIRCIA and the 
Rule. But the Rule, implemented correctly, presents a critical 
opportunity to advance this goal.
On the matter of Rulemaking process:
            The landscape will continue to change--The Rulemaking 
                    process on CIRCIA should enable ``ex parte'' 
                    filings and engagements in the 15 months that 
                    follow the comment period.

    CISA's 450-page NPRM on CIRCIA was released on April 4, 2024. 
Indeed, CISA's comprehensive and diligent work has resulted in an 
extensive Rule that will have a significant impact on our Nation, its 
security posture, and definitions that will have a profound impact on 
small businesses and the startup/innovation community. The majority of 
impacted entities may not be able to bring their unique point of view 
forward during this time frame, and most lack the resources and access 
to Government affairs professionals.
    CISA has engaged extensively with stakeholders via the RFI, and 
various listening sessions, yet the critical phase of the regulatory 
development process begins now--with the release of the Proposed Rule, 
the Comments Consideration and adjudication process, and preparation 
for Final Rule release. Thus, we encourage CISA not only to extend the 
comment period and continue with the stakeholder engagement process but 
to also create a process that will allow for additional ``ex parte'' 
meetings and filings on the Rule. This should be accompanied by a 
transparent process for ex parte filings publication, similar to the 
proposed rules processes conducted and operated by the Federal 
Communications Commission or the Copyright Office.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ See, for the FCC, 47 CFR  1.1200-1.1216, and Federal 
Communication Commission, ``Ex Parte Resources'', https://www.fcc.gov/
proceedings-actions/ex-parte/general/ex-parte-resources. See, for the 
Copyright Office, 37 CFR  201, 205, U.S. Copyright Office, Ex Parte 
Communications, https://www.copyright.gov/rulemaking/ex-parte-
communications/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Such a process would ensure that perspectives could be provided in 
a transparent and inclusive manner to CISA as the policy, technology, 
and threat landscape evolves in the 15-month period that follows the 
NPRM release and after the comment period has ended. This would enable 
additional engagement and better alignment on the Rule, following the 
formal comment period.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ OpenPolicy conducted meetings and led ``ex parte'' comments on 
a recent Cybersecurity policy related Rule and Order released by the 
FCC, which were ultimately cited in the Final Order. We find this 
process to be very useful and essential in a case where the evolving 
landscape merits continued, transparent engagement during the long 
period of comments adjudication, and particularly beneficial for small 
businesses who may not be able to engage on NPRM by the end of the 
comment period. We acknowledge the robust engagement processes already 
done by CISA, and further encourage CISA to continue and expand its 
engagement processes with innovative companies and small businesses, 
especially for sectors where they serve a large proportion of the 
impacted community, such as the DIB.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
On matters of policy:
            The cumulative cost of compliance burden, due to the 
                    proposed scope and expansion of liability, should 
                    be balanced and reciprocated with increased cyber 
                    resilience and risk reduction value
    The record on stakeholder engagement reflects consensus on 
underlying concerns associated with definitions and issues proposed to 
be addressed in the Rule:
  <bullet> Complexity and Regulatory Duplicity (among Federal agencies 
        and regulators, States and Federal laws, and other applicable 
        global regimes, such as E.U. NIS 2.0 directive) that will 
        result in duplicative reporting, information and data overload, 
        ``noise'', and extensive compliance burden on entities, 
        including on small businesses, during the critical, ``fire-
        fighting'' period of incident response, when resources are 
        limited. There is an urgent need for ``harmonization'' and 
        streamlining of requirements.
  <bullet> Concerns related to the definition of ``covered cyber 
        incident'' capturing ``too much'' and in a manner that does not 
        advance CISA's situational awareness, but rather overwhelms 
        CISA.
  <bullet> Concerns related to the chilling effect of expanded 
        liability, which may hinder the public-private partnership 
        model that undergirds information sharing and threat mitigation 
        practices today with the U.S. Government and CISA, in 
        particular.
  <bullet> Concerns related to the scope of covered entities and impact 
        on smaller businesses.
  <bullet> Concerns related to the adverse impact to privacy and 
        security due to increased information sharing, in certain 
        cases, and the case of sharing sensitive ``vulnerability'' 
        information in particular.
    The Rule proposes a broad scope on many of these issues, notably 
the definitions of covered entities, incidents, and required fields. It 
notes however CISA's goal is to ``achieve the proper balance among the 
number of reports being submitted, the benefits resulting from their 
submission . . . ''. Our overarching recommendation is to ensure that 
the cumulative impact and increased costs associated with such 
expansion, will in fact, result in additional value to risk reduction 
and enahnced cyber resilience.
    To that end, OpenPolicy proposes the following policy 
recommendations:
    To ensure enhanced situational awareness of cyber threats across 
critical infrastructure sectors ``translates'' into enhanced cyber 
resilience and risk reduction, CISA should consider:
  <bullet> Additional reports, support functions, and public-private 
        partnership structures focused on impacted under-resourced 
        entities for information sharing and cyber resilience 
        resources.
  <bullet> Robust consideration to ensure that state-of-the-art secure 
        and diverse sets of technology solutions, including AI 
        capabilities, are used to intake incident reports,\6\ review 
        them, respond, and enable real-time mitigation in a way that 
        supports entities' ability to transition from ``remediation'' 
        to ``prevention''.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ One method of technology adoption could be adopting 
standardized reporting forms supported by advanced programmatic and 
technological capabilities, whereby CISA can quickly operationalize, 
anonymize, and share data with the industry in a way that is not 
attributed to specific entities. This approach ensures that incident 
information, rather than being relegated to solely routine threat 
reports, is transformed into actionable intelligence that can be 
immediately utilized to protect entities and enhance industry awareness 
and preparedness. The primary purpose of this reporting requirement 
should be to deliver critical and practical information in real time, 
enabling front-line cyber defenders to thwart attacks. Clarifying this 
goal will significantly aid in addressing the tactical details of the 
final rule. It would not only ensure that it meets its intended 
objectives effectively but also foster the overall resilience and 
awareness of the entire cyber ecosystem.
    \7\ CISA notes, the concern from ``noise'' increased scope (as 
illustrated by a broader set of ``entities'', ``incidents'', and 
``reporting fields''), ``can be mitigated through technological and 
procedural strategies.'' [Rule, at 23652-3]. More attention and 
resources should be provided in support of such technological and 
procedural strategies, to achieve the desired ``translation'' effect. 
CISA also recognizes further the breadth of duplicity and also that 
agencies may have different motivations in requesting such information.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <bullet> Alignment of other CISA, and other Government-supported, 
        resources (including programs such as CDM) to the nexus of 
        threats, indicators, and compromises ``spotted'' via the 
        reporting.
  <bullet> Increased funding and resources to support the intake of 
        remediation solutions and overall resilience of critical 
        infrastructure, including Federal infrastructure, to attacks--
        embodying the zero trust and secure by design culture.
    Our continued focus should be preventing attacks, not only 
remediating them. The volume of reports should be calibrated in service 
of this cause. Achieving this goal will entail a broader technical and 
programmatic collaboration between all Federal agencies involved, as 
well as the adoption of technology solutions.
    To summarize, CISA was tasked with regulatory development and 
proposed definitions seeking to balance these inquiries with the 
underlying congressional intent of CIRCIA. The NPRM reflects a 
cumulative extended scope of proposed definitions with respect to 
covered entities, the scope of incidents to be reported, the 
application on small businesses, and the potential (and actual risk) 
for duplicative burden for reporting.
    Overall this approach reflects a higher ``cost'' and ``burden'' 
that needs to be accompanied by a balanced ``value'', and progress in 
situational awareness and risk reduction--thereby enabling a 
significant ``giving back'' component.
    Further action is needed to reduce the potential cost associated 
with regulatory duplicity and the potential for liability
    CISA has acknowledged both the concerns of stakeholders associated 
with a complex reporting landscape and the need for further action on 
this matter.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\ ``In an attempt to minimize the burden on covered entities 
potentially subject to both CIRCIA and other Federal cyber incident 
reporting requirements, CISA is committed to exploring ways to 
harmonize this regulation with other existing Federal reporting 
regimes, where practicable and seeks comment from the public on how it 
can further achieve this goal.'' Id. at 23653.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We recommend the following:
  <bullet> CIRCIA Agreements, geared to enable information-sharing 
        mechanisms and the underlying technology architecture to 
        support such sharing in a secure manner, should be prioritized, 
        resourced, and achieved. The Rule clarifies that good-faith 
        efforts to reach such agreements would be made. However and as 
        demonstrated by policy actions in the last 2 years, achieving 
        this goal requires a more holistic and deliberate effort from 
        all agencies involved and Congress. As the Congressional 
        Research Report on CIRCIA puts it: ``It seems unlikely that 
        Federal regulators will relinquish their specific reporting 
        requirements in deference to CISA because existing regulations 
        and the proposed CIRCIA rule serve different purposes.''\9\ 
        (emphasis added).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\ Congressional Research Service, CIRCIA: Notice of Proposed Rule 
Making: In Brief, April 11, 2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <bullet> One of the focal points of the CIRCIA agreements should be 
        addressing the potential overlap with reporting requirements 
        applicable to the Defense Industrial Base (DIB), under DFARS 
        clause 252.204-7012. This path will reduce the considerable 
        burden on a sector that is largely composed of small businesses 
        (see below). This approach could be enabled by 2 related policy 
        actions that recently matured. First, The DoD DFAR is soon to 
        be revised,\10\ thereby enabling further harmonization, despite 
        the difference in scope of the ``incident'' definition.\11\ 
        Second, the DoD recently announced supporting infrastructure 
        that can potentially enable a CIRCIA Agreement.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \10\ The Defense Acquisition Regulations Council Director has 
recently tasked a team with rule development, exploring a revision for 
DFARS clause 252.204-7012, DFARS clause 252.204-7012, Safeguarding 
Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting (See DFARS 
Case 2023-D 024, has described, on the DFARS Open Cases Report, https:/
/www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/opencases/dfarscasenum/dfars.pdf.
    \11\ Compared to the CIRCIA proposed rule definition, covered 
entities in the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Sector are already 
obligated to report cybersecurity incidents in a substantially similar 
time frame (72 hours) pursuant to DFARS clause 252.204-7012, see 
Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting. 
In contrast, the current scope of the DIB sector reportable incidents 
is narrower, and focuses on compromises of Controlled Unclassified 
Information while the CIRCIA proposed rule outlines a broader scope for 
``covered incident''.
    \12\ On March 12, 2024, DoD published the Defense Industrial Base 
Cybersecurity Activities (DIB CS) final rule, which expands eligibility 
to DoD's voluntary incident reporting and cyber threat intelligence 
sharing program to all DIB entities (rather than just cleared defense 
contractors). These revisions will allow all defense contractors who 
own or operate an unclassified information system that processes, 
stores, or transmits covered defense information to benefit from 
bilateral information sharing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <bullet> Congress should conduct oversight and perhaps even act in 
        service of achieving additional CIRCIA agreements and reducing 
        duplicity, when practical and desired, to achieve agency 
        alignment.
  <bullet> The need for harmonization and reducing duplicity is 
        clear.\13\ The path toward reducing regulatory duplication, 
        including with globally applicable regimes, should move away 
        from aspirational and exploratory, toward actionable and 
        practical--and such efforts will likely require a common 
        technology architecture, where additional resources may be 
        needed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \13\ See also the National Cybersecurity Strategy, at p. 11, ``The 
Federal Government must coordinate the authorities and capabilities of 
the departments and agencies that are collectively responsible for 
supporting the defense of critical infrastructure''.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <bullet> On legal liability, we recommend enhanced ``due process'' 
        mechanisms for covered entities. We are concerned about 
        liability protection erosion in the case of good-faith 
        disagreements between CISA and the covered entity. As drafted, 
        liability protection measures are ``abandoned'' once a subpoena 
        is issued but without intervening process. While CIRCIA 
        provides CISA the ability to use its subpoena power, the 
        current NPRM does not include further consideration, or a 
        ``curing'' process, an arbitration process, or other procedures 
        to deliberate with CISA, in good-faith, the amount of 
        information requested prior to CISA leveraging its subpoena 
        power, while enabling the entity to maintain liability 
        protection (see  226.14(d)(1), and ps. 23735). We recommend 
        further consideration and Congressional oversight to ensure a 
        measured approach in the Final Rule implementation on this 
        topic.
Small Businesses First ``Mindset''
    Although the CIRCIA proposed rule affects many small entities 
across all critical infrastructure sectors, its impact on the DIB 
Sector small business community is profound. Defense security 
compliance Industry Expert Jacob Horne provided some striking 
analysis:\14\

Double Incident Reporting for the DIB, available at: https://

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <bullet> Nearly a quarter of all affected entities are in the Defense 
        Industrial Base Sector.
    <bullet> Of the 316,244 affected entities, CISA estimates 72,000 of 
            them are in the DIB.
  <bullet> 17% of entities affected by the CIRCIA proposed rule are DIB 
        SMBs.
    <bullet> DoD has stated that roughly 75% of the DIB is made from 
            small and medium-sized businesses.
    That amounts to 54,000 of the 72,000 DIB entities in Table 1 
        Affected Population, by Criteria (see NPRM, at 23742).
  <bullet> 98% of affected entities are SMBs, 17% of affected SMBs are 
        in the DIB.
    <bullet> Of the 316,244 covered entities, CISA estimates that 
            310,855 would be considered small entities (See, Id. at 
            23763).

See Table 1 and Table 10 of the NPRM, Id.

    We, therefore, recommend prioritizing ``scoping'' activities (such 
as achieving CIRCIA agreements) impacting small businesses that are 
profoundly impacted by the Rule, such as the DIB small business 
community.
                                summary
    The Congressional intent for CIRCIA is ``preserv[ing] national 
security, economic security, and public health and safety'', and 
assisting the Federal Government with increasing situational awareness 
and visibility to cyber threats in support of a broader mission to 
achieve systemic risk reduction for the United States and its 
underlying critical infrastructure. This ultimate value, of increasing 
cyber resilience merits additional proportionality between the cost, 
and value of and processes CISA and the Federal Government will 
exercise to ``give back'' to impacted communities who bear the 
implementation cost. This balance may require more resources and 
additional infrastructure to ``rapidly deploy resources'' and better 
diverse, state-of-the-art solutions to stay ahead of malicious actors 
and deploy alerting systems. It will further require those who need to 
alert the Government--to have solutions, and ``alert systems'', to spot 
issues, and to intake alerts and process them into action. To achieve 
cyber resilience we must approach CIRCIA implementation in the context 
of the broader common fabric of cybersecurity policy efforts, 
implemented in the United States and globally.
    Creating the architecture, technically, procedurally, and 
programmatically, and the culture, that truly achieves the underlying 
risk reduction goal of CIRCIA will require action from CISA, and other 
agencies, that may extend beyond the Rule, but proper implementation of 
CIRCIA can result in considerable progress. Much progress has been 
made--we will continue to rely on Congress's relentless attention to 
this matter, as we move forward with CIRCIA's implementation.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify today and look forward for 
your questions.

    Mr. Garbarino. Thank you, Ms. Elazari.
    Members will be recognized by order of seniority for their 
5 minutes of questioning. An additional round of questioning 
may be called after all Members have been recognized.
    I now recognize the gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Ezell, 
for 5 minutes of questioning.
    Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Thank you all for being here today, and I'll just tell you 
I can't hear as fast as you talk. So just be a little patient 
with me. I may talk a little slower than the rest of these 
folks around here, but I'll do my best.
    As CISA introduces new proposed rules around cybersecurity, 
I want to ensure that our industry partners are being heard.
    Ms. Hogsett, CISA estimates that implementing the CIRCIA 
will cost $2.8 billion, cover 314,000 entities, and result in 
over 200,000 reports over the next 11 years.
    Do you agree with CISA's analysis about the cost and this 
impact?
    Ms. Hogsett. Thank you for the question, sir.
    So we are still going through the estimates and how CISA 
put those together. I will say, based on our conversations with 
financial institutions, that from what we can tell, the 
estimates for both number of companies and entities that would 
have to report, the number of reports they would likely 
receive, but also the cost to retain certain information is 
underestimated by quite a significant margin.
    This is not an insignificant Government reporting burden 
that would be imposed on covered entities.
    Mr. Ezell. To give us perspective, how many reports do you 
estimate that entities in your sector generate in a year? Can 
you describe current existing compliance costs for your sector?
    Ms. Hogsett. For my sector?
    Mr. Ezell. Yes.
    Ms. Hogsett. So I'd have to get back to you with more 
specifics for the purpose of CIRCIA.
    What I can tell you is that financial services is one of 
the most heavily-regulated sectors out there.
    Mr. Ezell. Right.
    Ms. Hogsett. We recently did a survey of our member 
institutions to look at the compliance burden and the amount 
time that they spend on regulations and compliance, as opposed 
to improving their programs and defending against attackers.
    Chief information security officers who are often the lead 
point for this within firms report spending anywhere from 30 to 
50 percent of their time on compliance, and their teams 
collectively have reported spending about 70 percent of their 
time.
    Mr. Ezell. OK. One of the stated goals of CIRCIA is to use 
information gathered about cyber incidents and to, ``enhance 
the quality and effectiveness of information sharing in 
coordination of efforts with the appropriate entities''.
    Are you confident in CISA's ability to analyze this massive 
amount of data and use it to produce actionable information in 
some sort of a timely fashion?
    Ms. Hogsett. Again, thank you for the question.
    We think that CISA has some work to do to scale back the 
requirements of this to ensure they are getting useful 
information and we're not just getting a lot of signal because 
we want CISA to be able to pinpoint those incident and those 
threat vectors that are really of most significance and then 
have the capability to very quickly turn that back around so 
that if a financial institution is facing something that might 
come to face an electric company or a telecom, that that gets 
out very quickly and we can prevent that from spreading 
further.
    That requires a speed with which we have not yet seen 
Government be able to move. So we do encourage narrowing the 
threshold for incidents that would need to be reported, 
narrowing the elements that would need to be reported, and then 
also ensuring that CISA has the necessary capabilities and 
staff expertise.
    You need some level of subject-matter expertise to also 
kind-of know what to look for to really make this successful. 
We think it can be successful and it would be very valuable, 
but we do need to narrow it a little bit.
    Mr. Ezell. Well, anytime you get the Government involved, 
it's going to slow down. We all know that. So, you know, coming 
from police world, we get a lot of information, and sometimes 
it's not that easy to gather it and use it and get it done in a 
timely manner.
    So, Dr. Elazari, can you highlight some areas where Federal 
agencies could improve regulatory reporting requirements to 
help small businesses?
    Ms. Elazari. Thank you, sir.
    So it is really striking to see the largest amount, 
significant amount of impacted entities are actually smaller. 
The threshold that is now proposed is building on the small to 
medium business size. So actually a start-up with a 50 million 
ARR, annual revenue, I understand from the estimates could be 
in scope. So this is a very large community.
    Out of it, interestingly, a lot of it from the defense. The 
defense industrial base, these are innovators. They are working 
to protect us. So this is an area we must pay attention to.
    So we are aware of a lot of duplicity, and actually it's 
striking. The Congressional reports, research itself says it's 
unlikely that some agencies would resist urge to continue with 
their reporting requirements because they think it's served--
it's serving other goals.
    Mr. Ezell. Right.
    Ms. Elazari. So this is an area where we would need 
Congress support with.
    I want to be very actionable. The duplicity issue is 
serious, and it's discussed. There is a National Cyber Director 
report on it. It requires additional action.
    In the context of the CIRCIA agreement framework that CISA 
has put out in the proposed rule, the use of the terminology is 
somewhat aspirational. We would study the potential duplicity. 
There is desire and good-faith desire to work with agencies, 
but we really need to be doubling down on those sectors where 
the duplicity is not just harmful for the businesses, it's 
harmful for the Nation.
    In those areas where we have a lot of burden on small 
businesses like the DIB which some common architecture formats, 
where we can, where we can achieve common goals--and I 
understand that two recent changes in the default rules for the 
DOD have opened the door on--for this issue. I've elaborated on 
this in the written testimony. So we think this should be a 
priority.
    Mr. Ezell. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Garbarino. The gentleman yields back.
    I now recognize the former Chair of this committee, the 
gentlelady from New York, Ms. Clarke.
    Ms. Clarke. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    I thank our Ranking Member for allowing me to waive on this 
afternoon.
    Good afternoon. First, let me thank our panel of witnesses 
for joining us today to share their views on CISA's recent NPRM 
on cyber incident reporting.
    Let me also once again thank the Chair and Ranking Member 
for permitting me to participate in today's hearing.
    CIRCIA was one of the subcommittee's most significant 
accomplishments during the 116th Congress, and I'm committed to 
ensuring its success.
    I'm also glad to see some familiar faces at the witness 
table. Both Ms. Hogsett and Mr. Mayer testified at the 
subcommittee's legislative hearing on CIRCIA in September 2021 
and offered critical input that improved the bill.
    So I appreciate your continued commitment to CIRCIA's 
success.
    Implementation of CIRCIA will be an enormous undertaking 
for both the Government and the private sector, and so I 
congratulate CISA on publishing the NPRM.
    Having reviewed sections of the proposed rule, I want to 
clarify a few points. When I began working with my colleagues 
on the subcommittee and in the private-sector draft CIRCIA, our 
consensus was that the Federal Government would benefit from a 
well-scoped incident reporting framework.
    Notably, on September 2021--at a September 2021 hearing, I 
said that we do not expect all critical infrastructure owners 
and operators to be subject to this reporting requirement. 
Rather we expected to apply only to a subset.
    Additionally, our intent was that reporting requirements 
would be appropriately tailored to limit overreporting and 
ensure that CIRCIA ultimately yields the security benefits we 
intended. In short, we wanted reporting from more than the 120 
entities the Solarium Commission recommended and a greater 
range of incident than just those that would trigger a unified 
coordination group. But we did not intend to subject everyone 
or every incident to reporting.
    To that end, I hope that CISA will continue to further 
engage with stakeholders to refine the parameters for incident 
reporting.
    Another priority was streamlining reporting and reducing 
the cost of compliance, which brings me to my first question 
directed to all of our witnesses.
    What can CISA do--be doing right now to streamline incident 
reporting and what can it do to ensure that cyber incident 
intake forms are accessible and easy to use?
    Mr. Aaronson. We'll go in order.
    So, first of all, let me just thank you, Representative 
Clarke, for everything you just said about your intent with 
CIRCIA. I think all of us, I'll certainly speak for EEI, agree 
with that intent.
    I think, most importantly--and I mentioned it both in my 
written and verbal testimony today--is to leverage sector risk 
management agencies as areas where they are already collecting 
data through mandatory reporting requirements that are sector-
specific and meaningful.
    Leveraging the substantially similar reporting requirement 
definition that you put in the act but that doesn't seem to 
really be as prominent in the proposed rule is probably the 
most important recommendation I can give.
    Mr. Mayer. Thank you, Congresswoman Clarke, and also thank 
you for the work you've done to put--promote this work with 
CIRCIA and other efforts in cybersecurity.
    I think the two points you mentioned are critical here, and 
here's where there's opportunities for improvement.
    One is a subset of the covered entities. I have no way of 
providing any assurance, as I read the rules as they are 
proposed, that we're not going to require all of the companies 
within our sector to be responsive to this. That will 
absolutely guarantee that the CISA will be overwhelmed with 
information that's submitted.
    The question was asked about the 200,000 potential reports 
between now and 2033. That's light years away, 11 years, when 
it comes to cybersecurity. We'll be in a completely different 
environment in 11 years. We'll have 6G. We have AI. We'll 
probably have quantum computing at that point.
    So trying to speculate about what that environment looks 
like in terms of threats and reporting is very challenging.
    I do think it's very important that we get clarity around 
what is a reportable event because the way it reads right now, 
I have no way of knowing what a company would be responsible 
for submitting, given the current types of attacks that we're 
facing.
    One company alone in our industry talked yesterday about 
having 6,000 attacks a month. We could be at 200,000 reports in 
1 year or less just from a narrow subset of companies.
    So we really need work together with CISA and other 
stakeholders to figure out how do we get to the intention of 
the legislators, Congress, and CISA which is to provide rapid 
response in times of triage--we're talking about really 
significant incident--so that we can help victims, so that we 
can forewarn other folks in the ecosystem, that we can 
integrate the information, assemble it, study it, analyze it, 
and produce mitigating communications, what can we mitigate.
    If we do that, we have a much higher likelihood that we're 
going to be successful. If we don't do that, I think we're 
looking at a big problem. Hopefully over time it will evolve. 
We'll get better at it.
    Ms. Elazari. I will just add----
    Mr. Garbarino. We'll let--you can continue, please. You can 
answer the question.
    Ms. Elazari. OK.
    First of all, Ms. Clarke, thank you so much for your 
leadership in support of passage of the law.
    I will just add very briefly. Common architecture, the NPRM 
is very lean on except the web form and some API. Colleagues 
have already discussed the issue of the definition, the scope, 
the reporting.
    If there is not going to be a very sophisticated technology 
system to take all this intake forms with one format and APIs 
or at least where we can harmonize, we won't be able to 
leverage the same cutting-edge solutions that the adversaries 
are already using.
    That is technology that is also going to help us move again 
from prevention, from the firefighting, to understanding the 
systematic risk, to moving to cyber resilience which is 
prevention.
    Ms. Clarke. Thank you.
    I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I thank you, Ranking Member.
    I appreciate the indulgence. Thank you.
    Mr. Garbarino. Thank you. Thank you for coming.
    I now recognize the gentlelady from Florida, Ms. Lee, for 5 
minutes.
    Ms. Lee. Thank, Mr. Chairman.
    Thank you to all of our witnesses for being here today for 
this hearing.
    Mr. Aaronson, I would like to start with you.
    You identified in your testimony 5 specific areas you 
thought were in need of further consideration related to our 
process here, and one in particular was data preservation 
requirements.
    I recognize your concern about the cost and logistics of 
maintaining the current data preservation that is proposed, but 
CISA suggests that maintaining data in this way helps them to 
analyze information and come up with better long-term 
strategies to help prevent attacks.
    Would you share with us how long and in what way you 
recommend data be preserved?
    Mr. Aaronson. Thank you so much for the question, 
Congresswoman Lee.
    So I would say the importance of data retention, that's a--
that's resource-intensive. We were talking about some of the 
statistics that you've heard. Mr. Mayer just mentioned a 
number. I mentioned a company that will remain nameless but 
that thinks they could have as many as 600 a month, and that 
would--that would evolve out to more than 65,000 over the next 
9 years.
    That is a significant burden of retention. That's a 
significant burden on the resources that would be needed from a 
digital perspective. That's a significant burden from a work 
force perspective, having to manage all that.
    So I think maybe a little bit more philosophically, 
juxtaposing incident reporting, which is mandatory, and 
information sharing, which is voluntary, the idea here is we're 
trying to glean signal from noise.
    I don't disagree with CISA's interpretation that more data 
could yield more information, but that's within reason. If 
we're talking about one company generating 65,000 reports over 
the course of the next 9 years, extrapolated over 300,000 
potentially covered entities, how do you glean signal from that 
noise? How do you get or manage 2 years worth of that data? How 
do you manipulate it? How do you resource it? How do you have 
staff that deals with it? How do you have the digital 
infrastructure that can actually maintain all of that?
    Those are really serious questions and really resource-
intensive challenges.
    Ms. Lee. Is there a time line that you think would be more 
appropriate?
    Mr. Aaronson. So I think it's less the time line and more 
the amount of data that would be requested. So if we can start 
to narrow down the number of reports that would be required to 
those things that are truly impactful and truly impacting truly 
critical infrastructure, then a 2-year time horizon is not 
untenable.
    But if you're talking about throwing everything against the 
wall, that's when it becomes a more resource-intensive 
challenge.
    Ms. Lee. You just mentioned something that is--was my next 
question because several of you have touched on this subject 
and that is the idea that the threshold for the reporting 
requirement itself you perceive to be overly broad and that 
it's going to capture too many things, too much information.
    I think Ms. Hogsett referred to it as, you know, what is a 
reportable event and whether the definition there should be 
narrowed.
    Mr. Aaronson, I'll start with you since we're already 
discussing it. Do you have any specific thoughts on how that 
definition should be narrowed? What should be a reportable 
event?
    Mr. Aaronson. So in particular, the--so it's the four 
prongs. Right? Any one of them could trigger a reportable 
event.
    The phrasing ``loss of integrity'' and some of the supply 
chain aspects, that's a lot of things. You know, without 
getting technical but things like password spraying, things 
like any sort of impact on a cloud provider could impact 
integrity, could impact availability. That becomes a reportable 
event.
    Does that really matter? That's the question that we need 
to ask ourselves. What are those types of incidents that we 
truly need to be collecting?
    Ms. Lee. Ms. Hogsett, let me hear from you on that same 
question.
    Ms. Hogsett. Yes, thank you for the question.
    So we referred to it in our past comments to CISA as it 
should be with malicious intent. So if you think about an event 
that is having an impact and causing harm and it's not just a 
technical glitch or a system mis-configuration that took things 
off-line, I don't think those are the things that CISA should 
be collecting on.
    But the way the definitions are currently crafted, it would 
capture that. We think that that should be narrowed to 
accommodate that letter.
    Ms. Lee. Mr. Mayer, do you have any additional thoughts on 
that threshold of reporting requirement?
    Mr. Mayer. I do think we have to get to the--when you are 
talking about confidentiality and integrating availability. You 
know, we're providing services that--we're providing services 
at 99.99 percent availability over the course of the year, what 
threshold would you lower that to, to make that reasonable?
    I don't know the answer to that. But it's not, you know, 
what could conceivably be every single type of outage that 
occurs because all networks have issues. The question is: Have 
you built in the resiliency, the redundancy to respond quickly 
and survive that? How resilient are the networks?
    I'm going to talk very briefly about supply chain because 
it's something I'm very familiar with through the task force. 
When you look at the supply chain and you talk about 
compromises, if we have to report events in the supply chain, 
we're not just talking about a static event. We're talking 
about everything from the design, to the development to the 
production, to the distribution, to the operations, to the 
maintenance, and ultimately to the end of the life cycle.
    What is--what we have to look at is: Where is the most 
critical event that's going to occur? What's going to be the 
immediate impact? What is the potential for some cascading 
impact? How big a part of the ecosystem can potentially be 
impacted? That's going to be an iterative and evolving process.
    So we have to get to the place where we can refine the 
analysis and thinking here and maybe have a life span of 6 
months. We may decide after 6 months this is no longer a 
legitimate threshold because there's a new attack vector.
    That's the kind of iteration. That's where the 
collaboration with industry comes in. That's where the shared 
expertise and, you know, perspective between Government and 
industry comes to play.
    Ms. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Garbarino. The gentlelady yields back.
    I now recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Swalwell, from 
California for 5 minutes of questions.
    Mr. Swalwell. Ms. Hogsett, just to follow up on your point 
about not having to spend time and resources reporting a 
glitch, which I agree with, how would you be able to tell that 
early on, though, if it wasn't malicious? I don't know the 
answer to that, but that would just be my follow-along on that 
issue.
    Ms. Hogsett. Yes, it does take time. I think there's room, 
and we have this in other areas where the entity is allowed to 
take time to actually assess what happened. You can fairly 
early on figure out, OK, well, we had a major upgrade going in 
and it went awry versus we don't know what this is. It 
potentially looks bad. Then our firms would err on the side of, 
like, that's a bad thing.
    It reaches we would refer to a materiality, like, has a 
significant material impact on a material part of your 
operations. That's a significant threshold.
    That's kind-of how we think about it and would encourage an 
opportunity to talk to CISA a bit further about how we could 
capture that.
    Mr. Swalwell. Great. Thank you.
    Ms. Elazari, you noted in your opening and alluded to the 
risk of being overly broad, especially for small businesses, 
and that if you do that, you risk them actually becoming more 
vulnerable to an attack.
    I think I understand what you are saying but just want to 
give you a little more time to articulate what that looks like.
    Ms. Elazari. Thank you, and I appreciate the question.
    So there are a couple of points here. Certainly the 
thresholds are really broad in the rule, both in terms of the 
definitions of the small businesses. They actually refer to the 
specific sectors in certain cases.
    I think we risk two main elements. When it comes to the 
small businesses, they really don't have the ability to divert 
the resource in order, you know, to make those type of 
assessments. So there is a strong, you know, concern they're 
going to be overreporting. They really cannot be seeping 
through those definitions, and they don't have the legal teams 
that could do that.
    The other perhaps, you know, striking problems is for the 
small businesses, if you're devoting the resource there, 
they're not firefighting. This is real risk.
    The final point is that those small communities are also 
the ones that really need our assistance not just in the 
prevention but into moving into remediation, not just the 
immediate attack but that Secure By Design, so multifactor, 
patching, the basic tools.
    So that should be a big focus, giving back. That may 
require some more resource, some more infrastructure.
    Very quickly, Congressman, with your permission, I will say 
most of the incidents we have seen out there, including some 
software supply chain issues, have nothing to do with malicious 
intent.
    So the common frameworks today for incident report do not 
hinge on the concept of malicious intent, but I do believe 
there is a lot of value in reflecting on what Europe is doing. 
NIS directive is already being implemented.
    It seems that the thresholds here in CIRCIA in the proposed 
NPRM are actually going beyond some of definitions there. So 
perhaps there is some learning to be held.
    Mr. Swalwell. Thank you. I think that also goes to what Ms. 
Hogsett was saying, that distinguishing between a software 
upgrade that goes south, and a malicious actor is really 
important, and we want to make sure you have clear guidance on 
that.
    To all witnesses--maybe Mr. Aaronson, I'll start with you--
and if you could just limit it to about 20 to 30 seconds so 
each could answer.
    As you engage with other regulators, what do you see as a 
willingness to harmonize with CISA?
    Mr. Aaronson. So, I think they're willing--I mean, it's 
probably a better question for the regulators themselves, but I 
think they would welcome that, right?
    So the electric power sector has the Department of Energy's 
OE-417 forms. Those are pretty interesting. They're very 
limited in what they're asking for, but when they are asked, 
it's because of an impactful incident.
    NERC has been around since 2005, and has been asking for 
some very specific information about incidents. That feeds very 
nicely into what CIRCIA is trying to do. I think it's just 
about not reinventing the wheel on the CISA side.
    I think on the sector risk management side, on the sector-
specific side, we've already got pretty good reporting regimes. 
Let's leverage those.
    Mr. Swalwell. Great.
    Ms. Hogsett.
    Ms. Hogsett. So some--we have a large number of regulators. 
Some of them are very willing to participate and sort-of 
recognize that you need to be aligned. We have others that are 
independent regulators who continue to do their own thing.
    The SEC is one I would point to in particular that we see 
as particularly harmful, but we've also seen the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission just earlier this year propose a new 
rule. As part of that, it would require instant reporting as 
well.
    So we continue to see a proliferation of additional 
requirements rather than a centralization, as I think Congress 
intended to make this occur through CISA.
    Mr. Swalwell. Great. Thanks.
    Mr. Mayer. So for the cons, I don't suffer the situation 
where we have, I don't know, 15, 20 different regulators. But 
we have one regulator who is very determined to impose 
cybersecurity requirements on our sector, and we would hope 
that as part of what the CIRC is recommending----
    Mr. Swalwell. Yes.
    Mr. Mayer [continuing]. There would be a dialog between 
CISA and our regulators to make sure that we're not having 
competing requirements, that a single set of information can be 
shared as appropriate.
    Any other agencies that get involved in this should begin 
to think about what that harmonization picture looks like 
broadly for the sectors, all of the critical infrastructure 
sectors.
    Ms. Elazari. Perhaps I can just provide one point of view. 
I think even if we had more cohesive--cohesive kind of 
landscape and we have more parallels, we still wouldn't have 
common architecture.
    So if the different regulators and agencies are not feeling 
like they're getting that visibility, sometimes their goal is 
different. We know from the SEC, the goal is, they're, you 
know, educating the investors, right, where the goal of CIRCIA 
is very different.
    If we want to have that common architecture to gain 
insights, of course with the state-of-the-art technology and 
with the secure elements that we need to maintain that 
information in confidence, even with that streamlining, it will 
be hard to get from that information everything we need to give 
back.
    So I think that's a common area of focus for the agencies 
as they're considering the duplicity.
    Mr. Swalwell. Great. Thank you. Yield back.
    Mr. Garbarino. The gentleman yields back.
    I now recognize myself for 5 minutes of questioning.
    I want to, in my second round, I'm going to focus on 
harmonization, but really on this first round, I want to talk 
about the specific rule, and really hear from industry as to 
what--you know, the comment period is open. We think it's going 
to be extended--what really needs to be done, because as I said 
in my opening statement, this needs to be done right. We don't 
want to do it and then have to change it. This needs to be done 
right. That is why we're doing this.
    You know, I was looking at some things, you know, for 
example, there's a--under the proposed rule, there's a covered 
entity would have to submit a supplemental report. They don't 
have all the information required within 72 hours of having a 
reasonable belief that there's an incident has occurred.
    You know, they're looking at, they want information such as 
technical details, physical locations of networks, devices, 
information systems, the impact of covered cyber incident, and 
the covered entity's operations, you know, et cetera.
    That seems just one of the many things that they're looking 
for. You know, I want to hear from you, do you think this 
information is feasible to provide, you know, within 72 hours, 
or, you know, how much longer after that will a supplemental 
report be filed? Are there going to be multiple--is there 
concerns of multiple supplemental reports?
    You know, I want to hear specifically from everyone, all of 
you, just really the concerns about what's under the current 
rule, what's proposed, and what needs to be done to fix it. So 
we'll start with Mr. Aaronson.
    Mr. Aaronson. So there's a lot there. I would say the rule 
itself--I think Ms. Clarke hit it really well--the intent of 
the committee always was to create a subset of reports that 
actually glean--you know, again, create meaningful insights, 
and I fear that by asking for all of these things in such a 
short amount of time--yes, there's the supplemental and all 
that.
    But as everybody has said, that fog of war in those early 
days, that is not a good time to be spending on compliance 
burdens; it's a good time to be responding and recovering and 
then understanding what the impact is.
    I'll keep going back to the value of the OE-417. There was 
an impact. Great. We told somebody there was an impact. Now 
there's knowledge that was an impact, and we can all talk to 
each other.
    The other value of that construct is, it creates a signal 
that something happened, now let's dig deeper.
    This idea that we are going to generate so much information 
in a short amount of time, in the interest of creating insights 
for other sectors, is just flawed. This goes back to my 
juxtaposing information sharing versus incident reporting. 
Incident reporting is about compliance. Incident reporting is 
about mandatory knowledge.
    As Dr. Elazari said, incident reporting in the SEC's case 
is about transparency to investors.
    If what we're trying to solve here is to create cross-
sector awareness, voluntary information sharing is what we need 
to be prioritizing, and to the extent that CIRCIA needs to find 
those truly impactful, truly critical incidents that happened, 
then having that first step of, this happened, like an OE-417, 
as opposed to trying to dig deep and create all of this, you 
know, kind-of long-term record, it's just not the right 
approach.
    Mr. Garbarino. Ms. Hogsett.
    Ms. Hogsett. To build on Scott's point, so this is frankly 
the most expansive data-reporting regime we've seen. We've got 
companies that have to comply globally with hundreds of 
different regulatory reporting requirements. This is the most, 
I think, of any of those, quite frankly.
    The data elements, as Scott noted, are well beyond what 
would initially be known. So, you know, a better approach, what 
I think we would propose is, narrow that to really critical 
information that you can do something with, and then send that 
back out to a wider audience.
    There is value in CISA being able to follow up with the 
entity, and I think on our part, you know, our firms would far 
prefer to get the information in quickly to CISA, and then have 
an on-going dialog if CISA would like more information, as 
opposed to making it a foregone conclusion that you must submit 
all of these data elements.
    If you actually read the full rule, the requirement is sort 
of an allowance to provide, if you don't have the information 
right away at 72 hours, you can provide the supplemental 
reports.
    The assumption, as its written, is that you will, at some 
point in time, provide all of that data, or at least say, don't 
have it, won't provide, and then you're sort-of like, Are you 
going to take it? Is that good? Or is CISA going to come back 
at you and say you didn't comply.
    So I think there's a lot of questions that firms still have 
around how often, like, when--what would trigger a supplemental 
report. You might have multiple of those before the incident is 
closed.
    It's just creating an on-going reporting requirement that 
we think could be balanced better to make it effective for 
everybody.
    Mr. Mayer. I think there's a theme here that runs across a 
lot of these issues, and that is a lack of specificity and 
clarity. So the rule talks about providing new and different 
information. I don't know what ``new and different 
information'' means and how significantly new it is, and how 
different it is from what was originally provided.
    It's also not time-bound. So I could be in this situation 
or a company could be in this situation where they're into 
perpetuity, you know, providing supplemental information that 
may not have any impact on improving security in the ecosystem.
    So we need to tighten this up, get some clarity around what 
type of supplemental information is going to contribute to a 
better understanding, allowing CISA to more immediately respond 
and help victims and forewarn victims.
    If it doesn't meet that criteria, we're going to be taking 
resources away from CISA's people, and we're going to take 
resources away from front-line practitioners, who are going to 
be more concerned about complying with the supplemental 
requirements out of fear of some enforcement action 
potentially. I don't think that improves security at all.
    Mr. Garbarino. Doctor.
    Ms. Elazari. I think it's worth underlying what was the 
goal with the supplementing reporting clause in the beginning. 
The concern was--and it's right--that in the 72 hours, there 
isn't enough information.
    So the goal was to report something and not fear from 
liability as we come toward the potentially, and often needed, 
supplemental reporting, but the problem is, we have all these 
fields, and instead of thinking about it as a voluntary measure 
as needing and allowing CISA to use their RFI, right, process, 
in order to ask more information, it's flipped backward.
    So that, combined with the potential for liability 
protections being removed once, you know, CISA exercises their 
subpoena power, creates a very big risk that people--entities 
will just be over-reporting at scale, essentially what we call 
in security DDOSing, creating a denial of service, overloading 
of information.
    Mr. Garbarino. Thank you, Doctor.
    I'm so happy my friend from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez, could 
join us. This is wonderful. I now recognize Mr. Menendez for 5 
minutes of questioning.
    Mr. Menendez. It's a pleasure to be here. Mr. Chairman, Mr. 
Ranking Member, thank you for convening today's hearing. To our 
witnesses, thank you for being here. I'd like to discuss 
possible solutions to building out CISA's analytical 
capabilities.
    Dr. Elazari, in your testimony you mentioned that CISA 
should be using state-of-the-art technology to collect incident 
reports, including leveraging artificial intelligence.
    Can you expand on how leveraging AI could improve the 
process of incidents reports?
    Ms. Elazari. Thank you, Congressman. So, I'm not the 
technology expert here, but our community does include some of 
the most innovative AI companies in the world. In security 
right now, the cutting--the leading-edge companies are 
leveraging AI in order to study information on scale, use 
generative AI models as well to be ahead of the attacker, to 
predict where the attacker would be, leveraging knowledge from, 
you know, the dark web and knowledge about the adversaries, and 
really, you know, being ahead of even the--of the incident.
    I think there is a lot of new technologies out there, but 
what is striking, in the context of the proposed rule, is 
CISA's comfort about getting all these reports. They actually 
say it--we're not concerned about not getting not enough 
reports--sorry--too much reports. We are concerned about not 
getting enough. We're going to solve it with today's technology 
and strategic approaches.
    But the funding is $100 million annually, I believe, so 
there is no proportion between how do we think that all this 
reporting is coming in, and actually we will be using cutting-
edge solutions like the solutions to give back.
    I must emphasize, give back, it's not just an immediate 
remediation. It's what are the patterns, where do we need 
prioritize more cyber resilience measures, right, those secure 
by designs, those measures that we need to give to the critical 
infrastructure entities that don't have resource.
    So we have to be leveraging those cutting-edge solutions 
and they're going to be changing in the next 15 months, and 
this is where the ex parte process will allow us to have that 
dialog with the right parties in place with CISA.
    Mr. Menendez. So you're confident in the technology and 
that it will assist CISA. You're just concerned, it seems like, 
that the funding mechanisms to ensure that CISA has the ability 
to procure and use and have the work force to use the 
technology that's state-of-the-art, cutting-edge, that will 
enable them to do their job better?
    Ms. Elazari. So I think, sir, there are also very 
legitimate concerns being raised on the scope itself. There are 
two prongs here. There is everything that is being reported in 
the overload, but then at the minimum at the other side, we 
should be using cutting-edge solutions because that's the way 
to make sure that the asymmetric advantage that the attackers 
have, they have--they go after the weakest link--is met with 
the best solutions to get the insights.
    I do believe that--and we need to study this more--but 
there is an underestimate on how much it's going to be costing 
to not just create that common architecture to get all the 
reports in one place and secure them, but also, use those 
solutions in order to make sure that we are actually having--
getting the best indicators. There is a lot of information 
right now we are asking for entities. We need to give back 
risk-reduction value.
    Mr. Menendez. Understood. On the flip side, is there any 
risk that in using AI, CISA's processing of these reports might 
include hallucinations, and could the use of AI end up reducing 
the accuracy for the sake of processing speed? Anybody that 
wants to answer that question.
    Ms. Elazari. I would just say very quickly, sir, that I 
think our--this administration, this Congress, recognizes both 
the benefits and the need to use AI, and both the potential 
risks. So I think there are processes under way. We are, in 
fact, taking part in many of them, to make sure that as we are 
deploying AI solutions, we are also making--make sure it's 
deploying solutions to make it trusted and secure.
    Mr. Menendez. Great.
    Mr. Mayer. We also want humans in the loop so that there's 
a way to make sure that the AI is not hallucinating and telling 
you to shut down, you know, parts of the global network when 
that may not be necessary, so.
    I mean, we're all going to be learning how to use AI and 
how to not use it and how to evolve it over time, how to make 
sure we have assurances that it's not, as you said, 
hallucinating. That's a process. It's a new technology that 
we're going to be looking at.
    Mr. Menendez. Keeping people in the room and part of the 
process, do you believe that we are--that the technology that 
we're developing, that's being developed in the AI space, or 
state-of-the-art technology that we could use for CISA, do you 
believe that our training of the work force is being developed 
as quickly, and will we have the people that we need to ensure 
that we keep--excuse me--people in the room to take advantage 
of the technology and have that sort of parallel track?
    Mr. Mayer. It's a race.
    Mr. Menendez. Yes.
    Mr. Mayer. We're going to have to do a lot to prepare the 
work force for the introduction of AI on so many different 
levels. The displacement that's going to occur as a result of 
AI is going to be significant.
    I will tell you that AI has advantages, both in terms of 
improving our defensive capabilities, but it also provides 
advantages to the adversaries in terms of their offensive 
capabilities.
    We know the adversaries are going to use every advantage 
they can get, and AI is going to be a big vector for 
accelerating that. So we have to have the same capabilities in 
terms of defending our networks and the ecosystem.
    Mr. Menendez. Absolutely.
    Ms. Hogsett. I would just add, I agree with Robert and the 
previous comments. The human capital element and the subject-
matter expertise is the key piece, that technology will get you 
so far. But not just keeping a human in the loop, but also CISA 
currently has challenges with having specific subject-matter 
expertise to, again, weed through the noise that they're 
getting in, to pick out key pieces and how to connect those.
    Machines can't currently do that, and it's actually 
something we've heard from security experts at the firms we 
work with, is that, if you've got someone who's watching 
networks all day long, they know when something is an anomaly. 
They automatically instinctively have that, and they know what 
to look for. So technology can amplify that, but it's not 100 
percent solution.
    Mr. Aaronson. I know we're over time, but I am 
professionally obligated, when talking about AI, as a 
representative of the electric power sector, to say a couple of 
things.
    So first of all, artificial intelligence, as has been said, 
is, first of all, an incredible opportunity with all sorts of 
efficiencies.
    It also represents an attack vector, for sure, and so from 
a national security perspective, it is an imperative that 
United States win at artificial intelligence.
    AI needs data centers, data centers need extraordinary 
amounts of electricity, and electricity needs infrastructure. 
So, we need to be making sure that we're building out 
infrastructure that can support this AI revolution, support the 
data centers that will support this digital opportunity.
    So there is a very clear through-line between the AI/
national security imperative and infrastructure development to 
support it.
    Mr. Menendez. Appreciate that, and yield back, Chairman.
    Mr. Garbarino. Come late and you go over.
    Now, for our second--I'm going to start a second round, and 
I'm going to recognize the gentlelady from Florida, Ms. Lee, 
for another round of questions.
    Ms. Lee. Mr. Aaronson, I'd like follow up on another one of 
the concerns that you identified. So overall, of course, we're 
here trying to find ways to streamline our processes, promote 
efficiency, eliminate duplication, but you highlighted a 
particular concern related to all 16 critical infrastructure 
sectors reporting to CISA, and therefore, all of this sensitive 
information residing at CISA as a potential protection of 
information becoming a vulnerability in and of itself.
    Tell us, though, how would you reconcile those two goals 
of, let's have a single reporting system, let's streamline this 
for our private-sector partners, but also, being concerned 
about housing that kind of information all in one single 
location?
    Mr. Aaronson. Yes. So it's sort-of a two-fold question. 
There is the malicious side of it which is--and I don't have 
some, you know, magic-wand answer. I would simply say, we have 
to recognize that that is going to be a target.
    That--you know, sophisticated adversaries watch incident 
reporting. They like to know: did their attack have the impact 
that they intended? They like to use that information to hone 
new attacks.
    So, a treasure trove, as I said earlier, of information is 
100 percent going to be a target. We simply need to protect it 
accordingly. I think this goes to some of the CISA resourcing 
issues.
    Let's go into this with eyes wide open. This isn't just 
about collecting data and putting it in a data warehouse 
somewhere. This is about protecting it as the critical, 
sensitive information that it is.
    The second part is protection from things like FOIA, and 
using, again, public policy protections, like in the electric 
power sector, we have CEII--critical electric infrastructure 
information--making sure that this does not become open-source 
information, that well-meaning public citizens and reporters 
and whomever else want access to. We just need to make sure 
that we put belts and suspenders around protecting it as the 
sensitive information that it is.
    Ms. Lee. You just mentioned something that I think is very 
interesting and important and not always recognized about 
artificial intelligence and the data centers and the 
necessity--the type of power and infrastructure that's going to 
be required to support these data centers.
    Would you elaborate a bit on what you see coming on the 
horizon in that regard?
    Mr. Aaronson. So extraordinary growth, and I think we 
always look at past performance as indicator of future need, 
and that's just not where we are right now. This is exponential 
growth that we are about to see.
    I see this as an opportunity for everybody involved. I 
think there are a lot of opportunities with respect to 
infrastructure build-out. There are a lot of opportunities with 
respect to things like small modular reactors. I think the more 
storage, battery, utility scale storage we can get out there, 
we have to build more infrastructure to support this demand. 
Full stop.
    I also view it as a supply chain challenge. The Chinese 
have used their industrial policy for the last 30-plus years as 
a weapon.
    Much as we hear the Director of National Intelligence say 
that near-peer nation-states are using cyber threats to hold 
the United States at risk at a time of their choosing, I think 
Chinese industrial policy is doing the same thing.
    When I talk about this, I like to use actually a Chinese 
proverb. The best time to plant a tree was 30 years ago. The 
second best time is today. The best time to combat Chinese 
industrial policy was 30 years ago. The second best time is 
today.
    So in addition to the build-out of the grid and 
infrastructure to support the AI revolution, we also need to be 
thinking about near-shoring, friend-shoring, onshoring, 
manufacturing capacity so that we can meet the demand growth 
that we're about to see.
    Ms. Lee. Then turning back to your earlier point about 
efficiencies, you touched on sector risk management agencies 
earlier, and suggested that we might be better--we might be 
better able to utilize them. Tell us more about your thoughts 
on the sector risk management agencies.
    Mr. Aaronson. Yes. So the electric power sector enjoys a 
really constructive relationship with our SRMA, the Department 
of Energy. There's a couple reasons for that. The Department of 
Energy is nonregulatory. So when we work with them, it is not 
with sort-of this regulatory sword of Damocles hanging over us. 
It is really this operational collaboration that happens 
between and among.
    Leveraging SRMAs as this existing entry point for 
information sharing and for existing incident reporting allows 
for, again, a more efficient way to then inform--and I want to 
be careful here--CIRCIA and CISA play a really important cross-
sector role.
    That said, inputs from sector-specific agencies to then 
inform the cross-sector, in the electric power sector's 
opinion, that's the value of CISA, that's the value of CIRCIA, 
and so we want to see that leveraged.
    Ms. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
    Mr. Garbarino. The gentlelady yields back.
    Even though he came late, I'm going to recognize him again. 
Mr. Menendez, from New Jersey, you're recognized for 5 minutes 
of questions.
    Mr. Menendez. That's why I love showing up, Mr. Chairman.
    An important part of improving cyber incident reporting 
requirements is to increase regulatory harmonization. 
Currently, not only have numerous Federal agencies imposed 
cyber incident reporting requirements, but many international 
governments have also mandated cyber incident reporting.
    In March, Secretary Mayorkas announced a new effort to 
align incident reporting requirements with E.U. regulations 
where feasible.
    For any of the witnesses, how important is international 
reporting harmonization to your sectors, and how can CISA and 
the NPRM help facilitate that kind of international 
harmonization?
    Ms. Hogsett. I'm happy to start. So for the financial 
services sector, we have a number of firms that operate 
globally and so I think one of the largest ones has I think the 
count is something like 115 different regulators that have a 
requirement to report incidents.
    So that international dynamic is very valuable if for no 
other reason than to help ensure that a victim company can 
focus on getting themselves back on their feet and protecting 
any of their customers, et cetera, and not focusing on having 
to tick the box on multiple different requirements.
    In our sector we actually have a G7 cyber experts group so 
of the global 7 countries that are our allies we have a work 
stream to help align some of these requirements.
    The Financial Stability Board for us has already put out a 
proposed incident reporting template that we're working to try 
to get alignment globally on those common data elements.
    The Cyber Incident Reporting Council that was created under 
CIRCIA actually highlighted some of this. There's a great value 
in helping streamline this so that we can all coordinate as we 
might need to globally.
    Like if China is targeting critical infrastructure here, 
they might be targeting it at our allies at the same point in 
time. We want to make sure they can get information and that's 
shared as well.
    The challenge right now with the way the CIRCIA rule has 
been put together is, it goes well beyond other requirements. 
So if you can narrow that, it will get us that much closer to 
having harmonization, having a streamlined reporting so that we 
can get information where it needs to go without disrupting a 
response.
    Mr. Menendez. Appreciate that.
    Mr. Mayer. I think the more that CISA can do to help 
facilitate a dialog, either bilateral or multinational dialog, 
around some level of consistency is going to be very important. 
It's not just international, we also have to worry about States 
and localities getting involved in fragmented reporting 
requirements.
    The more requirements there are that are not aligned and 
inconsistent, the much more challenging it's going to be for an 
enterprise to effectively address those reporting requirements 
in a way that's efficient for them and efficient for 
Government.
    So I think CISA has a role to play on that international 
dialog, along with other agencies of Government, including the 
State Department.
    Ms. Elazari. So to put this in context, I think actually 
the IT sector has, perhaps, the most multinationals, but it's 
not just multinationals with large departments of cybersecurity 
and lawyers.
    If we have those small business entities with some software 
that is focusing on a critical function--we're talking about 
start-ups with $50 million, you know, in revenue, these--
software is going anywhere, right? These companies often rely 
on operating globally often with Five Eye, with Europe.
    So, I think actually not only it is essential, there is big 
opportunity in this international alignment, and I want to 
speak about two things in particular. We saw this in action 
with the IoT Cyber Trust Mark and the important work with the 
FCC to look into the E.U.-cyber intersect.
    I believe the NAS 2 directive has actually more confined 
proposed definitions for some of the things we have seen in 
this proposed rule. So I think opting in, allowing companies 
that want to actually mutually report to a common architecture, 
at least when it comes to the NAS directive, where we have a 
lot of that critical sector and a lot of the IT companies 
already covered.
    That is one very particular implementation that would not 
only bolster cyber resilience and the ability to work with our 
allies for remediation but really help companies.
    So I think not only this is a priority. We need to be 
pragmatic and focus on these areas where we have the same 
covered entities, the same agreements, right, on the covered 
issues to ensure not just common definitions, but common 
architecture.
    Mr. Menendez. Appreciate that. One quick follow-up. The 
important work of regulatory harmonization requires not just 
the cooperation of CISA, but also the regulatory agencies that 
may have inconsistent reporting requirements.
    As you engage with other regulators, what do you see as a 
willingness to harmonize with CISA, and how can Congress and 
CISA better support efforts at regulatory harmonization? I went 
over last time, so these have to be quick answers.
    Mr. Aaronson. I'll try to give a quick answer. It's also 
responsive to Ms. Lee's question a minute ago, and I want to 
pick up on something Ms. Hogsett said.
    Common architecture, common definitions, the problem right 
now is CISA's requests are so much different than every other 
regulatory agency. They've kind-of gone above and beyond. There 
isn't anything that's substantially similar.
    So, I think there's got to be a, let's meet each other 
halfway. I think there are some regulatory agencies--I can't 
speak for any of them, but I think some would like more 
information. So maybe it is rising that tide a little bit. But 
CISA's got to come back down a little as opposed to asking for 
the kitchen sink.
    Mr. Menendez. I appreciate that, and I yield back.
    Mr. Garbarino. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize 
myself for 5 minutes of my second round of 5 minutes. That's 
good English.
    Mr. Mayer, CISA expects entities will be able to self-
identify as a covered entity, and they think it's going to be 
easy. Do you agree that most entities will be able to easily 
self-determine whether they are a covered entity under the 
rule?
    Mr. Mayer. Well, I think in our sector's case, I think--and 
I alluded to this earlier--I would start with the assumption 
that you're a covered entity just by virtue of the fact that 
you're providing communication services, you're a part of the 
critical infrastructure 16 sectors.
    I don't think, you know, the exemptions under the small 
business is going to necessarily be persuasive in getting you 
the exemption. So the assumption has to be that, assume you're 
covered.
    Mr. Garbarino. Better to be safe than sorry, I guess, 
right?
    Mr. Mayer. Sorry?
    Mr. Garbarino. Better be safe than sorry?
    Mr. Mayer. Correct.
    Mr. Garbarino. OK. The sector-specific plans referenced in 
the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking were last published in 2015. 
Is your sector still accurately represented by its specific 
plan?
    Mr. Mayer. I believe it is. I think when we look at what we 
identified as risks and the performance plan, many of that--
much of that is still relevant.
    I will say yesterday that the National Security Memo that 
came out will set in motion the requirement for a new sector's 
risk assessment, and a sector-specific plan. So we will put 
resources to evaluate what's changed, what's most impactful, 
and what stretch should we be thinking about and perhaps that 
we were not fully cognizant of over the, you know, years ago 
when we did the performance plan.
    I think, for example, AI is going to be a factor, and in 
the DHS ICT task force, we're looking at the threat analysis we 
did 3 years ago, and we're now going through with the lens of 
AI and trying to understand what changes about that threaten 
landscape.
    So yes, it's going to have to be updated, but a lot of it 
is still relevant.
    Mr. Garbarino. Thank you. I said I was going to talk a 
little bit about harmonization, and I can't do that without 
talking about the SEC rule which I hate. We've heard a lot of 
anecdotal concerns about the chilling effect that this rule, 
the SEC cybersecurity rule, is having on cyber information.
    Ms. Hogsett, can you explain from the bank--BPI'S 
perspective, I'll say, negative impacts, but I'll let you talk 
about potential impacts of the SEC's rule on cyber information 
sharing.
    Ms. Hogsett. Sure. Thank you for the question, and thank 
you for your leadership on this point. We really appreciate it.
    So our concern with the SEC disclosure rule is that 
literally the rule requires that 4 days after you've determined 
that you have a significant event, you are publicly disclosing 
that.
    If we look at CIRCIA, that means that basically CISA has 
about 24 hours, perhaps, to leverage the confidential 
reporting, and then turn that back around into useful 
information to help prevent attacks or further harm.
    That in today's day and age is an extraordinarily short 
period of time. So you're really cutting short and undercutting 
the purpose and the effectiveness of CIRCIA itself.
    Publicly disclosing gives attackers information they might 
not otherwise have. We have seen it being automated using bots 
to then start to automatically scan other companies to detect 
if they have a certain vulnerability.
    It also prioritizes the desire of investors to have 
transparency over the need for critical infrastructure to 
protect themselves. So we believe that this is very harmful.
    In the short 4 months that it has been in effect, we've 
already seen it interfere with long-standing collective defense 
efforts because it's caused confusion about what information 
can and cannot be shared.
    We've also seen attackers use it as an additional extortion 
method. So, if you don't file with the SEC, your ransomware 
actor will then threaten to report you to the SEC, and it is 
now the third prong of an attack that they have started to use.
    Mr. Garbarino. Thank you. Hopefully, our efforts--we're 
still working on a CRA--hopefully our efforts are successful. 
Last thing, I have time for probably one more question, and 
we're going to be submitting a lot of questions for you to 
answer, because I could go on for another hour, I think.
    Mr. Aaronson, just yesterday, Biden administration released 
an NSM-22 update and PPD-21, and you talked about how EEI 
enjoys a positive relationship with DOE, your sector risk 
management agency.
    Can you elaborate a little more on what's working well with 
the energy sector and the SRMA relationship and what could be 
improved as the administration works to implement both CIRCIA 
and NSM-22?
    Mr. Aaronson. These things just roll off the tongue, don't 
they?
    Mr. Garbarino. Yes.
    Mr. Aaronson. I miss PPD. That was a lot easier to talk 
about. So I mentioned before, I think part of the reason that 
we enjoy a good relationship with the Department of Energy is, 
they are nonregulatory. So, it's a much more trusted, kind-of 
open relationship.
    I think another aspect of our partnership is the Sector 
Coordinating Council. We have a CEO-led Sector Coordinating 
Council. I serve as part of the secretariat for that, 
represents all segments of the sector all across not just the 
United States but North America. It is a North American grid.
    Bringing chief executive officers together with senior 
Government officials really does help us to prioritize the 
things that are important and then work collaboratively to buy 
down risk.
    The last thing I think I would say is, a focus not just on 
trying to protect everything from everything all of the time, 
but instead, acknowledging that resilience is probably the most 
important avenue of defense. We call it defense in depth, 
right? The attack does not have the intended impact or when it 
comes to natural hazards, like storms and fires and earthquakes 
and what have you, that ability to make sure bad days do not 
become catastrophic.
    So, working collaboratively with Government to restore 
power as quickly as possible when something bad happens, having 
spare equipment programs working collaboratively with the 
Department of Energy on policies that enable resilience, that's 
really the crux of the fruitful relationship that we have.
    The last thing I'll say is operational collaboration. We 
talk a lot about information sharing--we talked about it a lot 
today--yes, information sharing is important, but industry and 
Government working hand-in-glove, side by side, to share 
actionable intelligence, to inform intelligence, through 
organizations like the Energy Threat Analysis Center, or ETAC, 
have been really fruitful ways to leverage Government resources 
and industry resources to buy down risk and to understand 
attacks and socialize mitigation as quickly as possible.
    Mr. Garbarino. Thank you.
    I now recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. 
Swalwell, for another round of questions. Do you have----
    Mr. Swalwell. Yes, please.
    Would you all agree that the SEC rule is affecting our 
ability to recruit talented CISOs to help us protect critical 
infrastructure? I'll start with Ms. Elazari. If that's the 
case, why is that the case, and is it driving folks out of the 
profession as well?
    Ms. Elazari. So I think it is the case. As a matter of 
fact, we've seen an amicus brief filed on litigation related to 
SolarWinds, SEC v. Tim Brown and SolarWinds. We have seen an 
amicus brief on behalf of the CISO community with about, I 
believe, 50 leading cybersecurity professionals, by the way, 
former, you know, S&P 500--very large organizations as well as 
a different amicus brief from Government--former Government 
officials, noting that one of the potential consequences of 
that particular litigation, but also the overarching, right, 
the overarching SEC cyber rule, is creating that chilling 
effect on the professional community.
    We must understand that is not a community we have many of. 
The gentleman here talked already about the issue of skilled 
work force.
    So this is a big priority, and we need to look at the 
CIRCIA rule and the scope of what's covered, but also, the 
issue of the liability protections being stripped away if there 
is a disagreement after the RFI and the first subpoena and to--
and really think about those professionals.
    So I think all of this is very important context because we 
do have a crisis around the skilled work force in 
cybersecurity, especially in the top layer. We have heard from 
the community there is impact, both with the rule and both to 
litigation around it.
    Mr. Swalwell. Great. Thank you.
    Anyone else want to weigh in on that?
    Ms. Hogsett. We've definitely heard a rise in concern among 
the CISO community with the SEC rule, particularly, as Dr. 
Elazari noted, the enforcement measure by the SEC with personal 
liability against the SolarWinds CISO.
    Cybersecurity is a team sport. The CISO is, quite frankly, 
sort-of the conductor----
    Mr. Swalwell. Yes.
    Ms. Hogsett [continuing]. And they can do many things, but 
they can't control all of it. So I think for CISOs who have not 
previously had that sort of a personal liability, it is deeply 
concerning for them, and I've actually heard of one who 
basically decided to retire because the risk was just too great 
after a really successful decades'-long career.
    Given the threat environment especially that we face, it is 
deeply concerning to many.
    Mr. Swalwell. As one recently told me who was a Fortune 100 
CISO, he said, when an attack happens now, rather than respond 
to the attack, the first thing that you do is, you huddle all 
of the lawyers, and you're losing precious response time 
because you're worried about, like, your personal liability on 
any action that you take, which means that consumer data and, 
you know, consumer information and then potentially critical 
infrastructure could be seriously jeopardized as that's taking 
place, so.
    Ms. Hogsett. Yes.
    Mr. Swalwell. I'll yield back.
    Mr. Garbarino. The gentleman yields back.
    I'd like to thank the witnesses for their valuable 
testimony and the Members for their questions.
    The Members of the subcommittee may have some additional 
questions for witnesses, I know I do, and we would ask that the 
witnesses respond to these in writing.
    Pursuant to committee rule VII(D), the hearing record will 
be held open for 10 days.
    Without objection, this subcommittee stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 3:43 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

                                 <all>
