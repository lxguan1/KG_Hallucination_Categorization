                     WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 2024


                                       U.S. Senate,
                               Committee on Indian Affairs,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:19 a.m. in 
room 628, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Brian Schatz, 
Chairman of the Committee, presiding.

            OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BRIAN SCHATZ, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII

    The Chairman. Good morning. Today, the Committee will 
consider the nomination of the Honorable Patrice H. Kunesh of 
Minneapolis, Minnesota, to be the Chair of the National Indian 
Gaming Commission for a term of three years.
    The President nominated Ms. Kunesh on July 23, 2024. She 
currently serves as the Commissioner of the Administration for 
Native Americans at the Administration for Children and 
Families in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
    Before we begin, I would like to welcome Ms. Kunesh and 
thank her for joining us, and thank her for always saying yes 
when being asked to serve.
    This hearing is an important first step in carrying out the 
Senate's constitutional obligation to provide advice and 
consent. It is an opportunity to learn how, if confirmed, Ms. 
Kunesh plans to carry out and uphold the United States' trust 
responsibility to tribes, and oversight function of the 
National Indian Gaming Commission over Indian gaming.
    It is our duty to establish a record of the nominee's 
policy views on Indian gaming, how she sees her role as chair, 
her plans to maintain the integrity of the agency she would 
lead, and how she would engage with tribal nations on a 
government-to-government basis.
    The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act established the NIGC as an 
independent, bipartisan regulatory agency within the Department 
of the Interior. The chair of the NIGC has important statutory 
powers that are critical to the regulation of Indian gaming, 
including the power to approve Class II and Class III gaming 
ordinances or resolutions, the power to impose fines and order 
the temporary closure of gaming facilities, and finally, the 
power to approve management contracts for Class II and Class 
III gaming.
    This Committee considered the nomination of former NIGC 
Chair Simermeyer, who was confirmed by the full Senate in 2019. 
The position of chair has been unfilled since the resignation 
in February of 2024. It has been almost 40 years since Congress 
passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. Gaming technology has 
rapidly advanced over the decades from electronic bingo to 
online sports betting. It continues to evolve quickly.
    Technology holds great opportunity, but with it regulatory 
challenges change and grow. The NIGC must adapt and its chair, 
as the top Indian gaming regulator, must exercise their 
statutory powers while staying true to the commission's mission 
to promote tribal economic development and self-determination 
in their gaming activities.
    This is no easy task, but Ms. Kunesh is a proven leader who 
can and will achieve this important balance. The Committee 
reported her nomination as ANA Commissioner favorably and the 
Senate confirmed her by a vote of 57 to 35 in February of 2023. 
Ms. Kunesh continues to serve in that capacity and has done so 
with distinction.
    I am confident that Ms. Kunesh will bring the same strong 
leadership and ethics to the position as she does in her role 
as ANA commissioner. The Committee has received endorsements 
from tribes and tribal organizations supporting Ms. Kunesh's 
confirmation and I have made them all part of the record today.
    I look forward to considering this important nomination and 
working with the Vice Chair and my colleagues to move this 
nomination through our Committee.
    Vice Chair Murkowski?

               STATEMENT OF HON. LISA MURKOWSKI, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA

    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Ms. Kunesh, welcome back to the Committee, and 
congratulations on your nomination.
    As the Chairman has noted, you are no stranger here in the 
Senate Indian Affairs Committee. In your current capacity as 
Commissioner for the Administration for Native Americans, you 
have appeared before us on our oversight hearing on public 
safety needs. In 2019, you participated in a Committee hearing 
to examine lending opportunities for tribal home ownership.
    I think it is fair to say that public safety and housing 
are top issues, certainly in my State, and I know it is for my 
fellow colleagues here on the Committee as well. So thank you 
for your work on these challenging issues and your continued 
commitment to serve.
    I do think it is important to talk a little bit about the 
commission that you are nominated to. As the Chair has noted, 
the commission was established by the Indian Gaming Regulatory 
Act of 1988. It is an independent Federal Regulatory agency 
housed at DOI.
    The commission has a big job. It is responsible for 
protecting the integrity of Indian gaming from mismanagement 
and infiltration by criminal elements. It does this by 
monitoring tribal activities at more than 500 casinos in 29 
States, conducting site inspections and processing background 
checks on tribal gaming employees.
    The NIGC also plays an important role in safeguarding 
gaming revenue for tribes, which must go toward supporting 
tribal governments and social services. It is a big, big 
business. Revenues topped $41.9 billion last year. This is an 
increase of $1 billion in gross revenues from last year.
    And as the Chair has noted, the chairman of the commission 
is a pretty powerful position, with exclusive authority to levy 
fines, and issue closure orders to tribal casinos that would 
violate NIGC regulations. The chair is also responsible for 
approving gaming ordinances and contracts between tribes and 
casino management firms.
    The mission of the NIGC takes on added significance given 
the tremendous changes that are occurring in the tribal gaming 
industry today. In recent years, tribes have entered commercial 
gaming markets that were unimaginable when IGRA was enacted 
back in 1988. Today, several tribes own casinos along the Las 
Vegas strip. Tribes have also entered the sports betting world. 
Some tribes offer sports betting apps for mobile devices, which 
is a rapidly growing industry.
    I think it is a testament to tribes and IGRA that tribes 
have achieved this level of success in the gaming industry. But 
we know that there are bad actors out there that might threaten 
the success. Tribal casinos are targets for cybercriminals, 
including ransomware attacks that have cost millions of dollars 
in losses, and casinos, tribal and non-tribal, have long 
attracted human trafficking and illicit drug activity that prey 
on the Nation's most vulnerable.
    So more has to be done to address the threats. I think we 
would all acknowledge that.
    So I am looking forward to hearing from you this morning on 
your views about these matters during this hearing. Again, 
thank you for your willingness to step up to this position.
    The Chairman. Thank you very much, Vice Chair.
    Senator Smith?

                 STATEMENT OF HON. TINA SMITH, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA

    Senator Smith. Thank you. I want to thank the Chair and 
Vice Chair and this Committee for holding this nomination 
hearing today to consider the nomination of Patrice Kunesh, a 
descendant of the Standing Rock Lakota, to serve as chair of 
the National Indian Gaming Commission.
    Mr. Chair, Vice Chair and Committee colleagues, I have 
known Patrice for many long years. We have done much work 
together. I can tell you, though you don't need me to tell you 
this, because she has been before our Committee before, that 
she is an exemplary public servant. I know she will do an 
excellent job in this role.
    As you have noted, Mr. Chair, Commissioner Kunesh currently 
leads the Administration for Native Americans at the Department 
of Health and Human Services. This is just her latest role in 
her lifetime of service to Indian Country.
    Just in the Federal Government, she has served in the 
Department of Interior, Department of Agriculture and the 
Minneapolis Fed Bank Centers for Indian Country Development, as 
well as the Department of Justice.
    At the Fed, Patrice oversaw some of the most important 
research that we have seen about the impact of gaming on tribal 
economies. So she knows first-hand the importance of gaming. 
And as attorney to the Mashantucket Pequot, she saw the origin 
of gaming and how it works at the tribal level.
    So I think you have an outstanding portfolio of experience 
to bring to this role. I am very grateful for your willingness 
to continue to serve Indian Country in this new capacity. Thank 
you so much and welcome to the Committee.
    The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator Smith.
    Are there any other members wishing to make an opening 
statement? If not, Ms. Kunesh, please rise and raise your right 
hand.
    Do you solemnly affirm that the testimony you give today 
shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth 
under penalty of perjury?
    Ms. Kunesh. Yes.
    The Chairman. Thank you. Please be seated.
    I will remind you that we have your full written testimony 
which will be made part of the official hearing record. Please 
keep your statement to no more than five minutes, so that 
members have time for questions.
    Ms. Kunesh, please proceed with your opening statement.

STATEMENT OF HON. PATRICE H. KUNESH, NOMINEE TO BE CHAIRMAN OF 
             THE NATIONAL INDIAN GAMING COMMISSION

    Ms. Kunesh. Good morning, Chairman Schatz, Vice Chairman 
Murkowski, and distinguished members of the Committee. Thank 
you so much for the opportunity to appear before you today as 
President Biden's nominee for Chair of the National Indian 
Gaming Commission.
    I grew up in a small town in central Minnesota. I am the 
seventh of 13 siblings, the mother of two daughters, and an 
unci, a grandmother, to the delightful Lucy Wintermoon. They 
are my pride and joy.
    Two strong influences have shaped my three-decade career in 
Federal Indian law and policy. One was my grandfather and the 
other was my father. My grandfather was born in 1902 on the 
Fort Berthold Reservation in North Dakota, home of the Three 
Affiliated Tribes, Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara. He spent his 
early years in Fort Yates on the Standing Rock Sioux 
Reservation.
    He was enrolled at Standing Rock Tribe, as was my mother. 
Like most Native families at the time, he was impacted by 
painful separations due to Federal Indian boarding school 
policies. It wasn't until 1924 that Congress passed the Indian 
Citizenship Act to confirm U.S. citizenship status on Native 
people, including their right to vote and own property. By 
then, my great grandmother made the courageous move to 
Minnesota in hopes of a more stable life. My grandfather 
remained close to his family on Standing Rock and his mother 
was buried there.
    It feels remarkable to me that his granddaughter was 
confirmed by the Senate in 2023 as Commissioner of the 
Administration for Native Americans at the Department of Health 
and Human Services by a bipartisan vote.
    My father's work for local government as both county and 
city attorney involved cases involving social services and the 
criminal justice systems. He was a strong advocate for Native 
youth and Native men who found themselves homeless or 
incarcerated due to the Federal Indian relocation and child 
removal policies.
    Their narratives, my grandfather's devotion to his 
homelands and my father's pursuit of justice, as well as my 
mother's ardent love for family, instilled in me a strong sense 
of vocation to become an advocate for Native American rights.
    I began my law career at the Native American Rights Fund, a 
public interest law firm whose mission is to protect Native 
rights, resources, and lifeways. Then as in-house counsel to 
the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation in Connecticut, I helped 
the tribe establish a judicial and regulatory infrastructure 
that continues to support its economic development, primarily 
centered around its gaming operations.
    As a professor, I taught courses on Federal Indian law and 
gaming at the University of South Dakota School of Law. Then-
President Obama appointed me to serve as the Deputy Solicitor 
for Indian Affairs at the Department of the Interior, and later 
as the Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development at the 
Department of Agriculture where I focused on housing, 
broadband, and other community infrastructure investments on 
reservation communities.
    At the Minneapolis Fed, I led the Center for Indian Country 
Development, an economic policy research initiative that 
supports the prosperity of Native nations. And in my current 
role as commissioner for the Administration for Native 
Americans, I have the great privilege of making vital 
investments in Native communities to enhance their social and 
economic well-being, of Native Americans, Alaskan Natives, 
Native Hawaiians, and indigenous people of the Pacific Islands.
    Indian gaming provides indispensable financial resources to 
catalyze reservation economies and contributes to essential 
services for the health and well-being of Native peoples. 
Importantly, it also promotes nation building and good 
governance.
    If confirmed, I would focus my attention on three areas. 
First, fulfilling the mission of NIGC in promoting tribal 
economic development, and maintaining the critical integrity of 
the Indian gaming industry. Second, I would endeavor to 
mitigate risks within the influx of new technologies and gaming 
formats, including online gaming and artificial intelligence. 
Third, I would be committed to good governance practices within 
the NIGC and ensure that NIGC has sufficient resources to 
fulfill its mission.
    It would be an honor to extend my service to Indian Country 
as the next chair of the National Indian Gaming Commission and 
help lead this agency into the new era of Indian gaming. Thank 
you for your time today. I look forward to your questions.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Patrice H. Kunesh, Nominee to be Chairman of 
                 the National Indian Gaming Commission
    Good morning, Chairman Schatz, Vice Chairman Murkowski, and 
distinguished Members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity

schools.
    It wasn't until 1924 that Congress passed the Indian Citizenship 
Act to confirm United States citizenship status to Native people, 
including their right to vote and own property. By then, having faced 
decades of deprivation and near destitution, my great grandmother made 
the courageous move to Minnesota in hopes of a better life. My 
grandfather eventually found work on the Alaskan Canadian Highway and 
sent his wages home to his wife in St. Paul to provide for their 
children. He remained very close to his family on Standing Rock and his 
mother was buried there.
    During the rare quiet times when my grandfather visited us, he 
would tell us stories from his summers at Standing Rock, his love for 
the prairie and his family, but also of being discouraged for not being 
there. It feels remarkable to me that his granddaughter was confirmed 
by the Senate in 2023 as Commissioner of the Administration for Native 
Americans at the Department of Health and Human Services by a 
bipartisan vote of 57-35.

    17. Selection:

    (a) Do you know why you were selected for the position to which you 
have been nominated by the President?

    I believe I have been selected for this position because of my 
experience and background in the area of Tribal government gaming and 
federal Indian law, as well as my commitment to public service.

    (b) What in your background or employment experience do you believe 
affirmatively qualifies you for this particular appointment?

    As I previously represented to this Committee when I was nominated 
for my current position, I am a vigorous advocate for the social and 
economic development of Native American communities. Motivated by my 
heritage and family's personal experiences, I have dedicated my career 
to improving the well-being and economic security of Native 
communities.
    I have practiced federal Indian law my entire law career, taught 
Indian gaming and economic development, worked directly with Tribal 
governments, and specifically, I have worked on Tribal gaming issues in 
the U.S. Department of the Interior's Office of the Solicitor and as an 
in-house attorney for a Tribe with extensive gaming facilities.
    I also have experience in executive leadership positions. I 
currently serve as the Commissioner and Deputy Assistant Secretary for 
Native American Affairs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services. Additionally, I have led several large federal programs in my 
previous roles as the Deputy Solicitor for Indian Affairs at the 
Department of the Interior, the Deputy Under Secretary for Rural 
Development at the Department of Agriculture, and the Director of the 
Center for Indian Country Development at the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Minneapolis.

will work closely with Congress to ensure such regulations comply with 
the laws passed by Congress.

    5. Are you willing to appear and testify before any duly 
constituted committee of the Congress on such occasions as you may be 
reasonably requested to do so? Yes.

                  f. general qualifications and views

    1. How does your previous professional experiences and education 
qualify you for the position for which you have been nominated?

    I possess extensive knowledge and experience with the laws and 
regulations concerning Indian gaming, as a law practitioner, a 
government attorney, and a legal scholar.

    2. Why do you wish to serve in the position for which you have been 
nominated?

    I wish to serve Indian Country in the best way possible and Indian 
gaming is the most robust industry that supports reservation economies 
and contributes to the health and/well-being of Native peoples. Thus, 
it is paramount that the industry is well-regulated and well-positioned 
for the next era of Indian gaming.

    3. What goals have you established for your first two years in this 
position, if confirmed?

    In addition to fulfilling the mission of the NIGC (promoting tribal 
economic development, self-sufficiency, and strong tribal governments; 
maintaining the integrity of the Indian gaming industry; and ensuring 
that Tribes are the primary beneficiaries of their gaming activities), 
I would endeavor to mitigate risks within the influx of new 
technologies and gaming formats in recent years (on-line gaming and 
artificial intelligence) and commit to ensuring good governance 
practices (efficient and cost-effective approaches in order to maintain 
the NIGC's operations).

    4. What skills do you believe you may be lacking which may be 
necessary to successfully carry out this position? What steps can be 
taken to obtain those skills?

    If confirmed as Chairman, I will need to learn the NIGC's internal 
administrative systems and operational processes. As I have done with 
other leadership roles, I will do so by engaging with staff and asking 
questions, and through hands-on experience.

    5. Please discuss your philosophical views on the role of 
government. Include a discussion of when you believe the government 
should involve itself in the private sector, when society's problems 
should be left to the private sector, and what standards should be used 
to determine when a government program is no longer necessary.

    A government's essential responsibilities are to create and enforce 
the rules of a society, defense, foreign affairs, the economy, and 
public services. Governments generally provide the legal and social 
framework, maintain competition, provide public goods and services, 
redistribute income, correct for externalities, and stabilize the 
economy. The government contributes to the economy by providing 
essential services, funding infrastructure projects, and maintaining 
social welfare, while the private sector drives economic growth through 
investments, job creation, and innovation. The extent to which 
government should be involved in the private sector is complex, and 
government involvement in business often depends on particular economic 
systems and current conditions. In general, governments play important 
roles in regulating industries to ensure fair competition, protect 
consumers and the environment, and promote economic stability. 
Additionally, governments provide critical financial support for 
certain industries, such as through subsidies or incentives, to achieve 
specific policy goals. The balance of government involvement in the 
private sector varies widely depending on the specific circumstances 
and priorities of a given state or region.

    6. Describe the current mission, major programs, and major 
operational objectives of the department/agency to which you have been 
nominated.

    The mission of the National Indian Gaming Commission is to promote 
tribal economic development, self-sufficiency, and strong tribal 
governments, maintain the integrity of the Indian gaming industry; and 
ensure that Tribes are the primary beneficiaries of their gaming 
activities.

    7. What do you believe to be the top three challenges facing the 
department/agency and why?

    I believe the top three challenges facing the gaming industry 
include: (1) Technology, particularly the influence of artificial 
intelligence. Technology is constantly changing the rules of the game, 
quite literally, and regulations often lag behind and quickly become 
outdated (2) Cyber security is a heightened challenge due to the volume 
of both revenue and available customer data and the ever-present risk 
to maintaining data security. (3) On-line gaming is a strong competitor 
to ``brick-and-mortar'' facilities such as casinos because it offers a 
convenient and cost-effective alternative to physical destination 
locations.

    8. In reference to question number six, what factors in your 
opinion have kept the department/agency from achieving its missions 
over the past several years?

    I believe the NIGC has successfully accomplished its mission over 
the past several years and has done a good job of navigating the 
complexities of the COVID pandemic, which shut down all gaming 
facilities across the country.

    9. Who are the stakeholders in the work of this department/agency?

    The stakeholders are tribal governments who own the gaming 
facilities, the employees and patrons of those facilities, the tribal 
citizens who receive essential governmental services paid for with 
gaming revenue, state governments with whom tribal governments have 
compacts, and the general public, who rely on the public safety and 
security in their communities.

    10. What is the proper relationship between the position to which 
you have been nominated, and the stakeholders identified in question 
number nine?

    As the chief regulator of the gaming industry, the Chair of the 
NIGC is responsible to all of these stakeholders in ensuring the 
integrity of the games and the optimal regulatory balance.

    11. The Chief Financial Officers Act requires all government 
departments and agencies to develop sound financial management 
practices.

    a) What do you believe are your responsibilities, if confirmed, to 
ensure that your department/agency has proper management aud accounting 
controls?

    It is the NIGC Chairmans responsibility to ensure absolute 
compliance with proper management and accounting controls.

    b) What experience do you have in managing a large organization?

    As the USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development, I was 
responsible for overseeing a $653 million budget, 47 State Directors, 
and collectively 4,800 employees. I supervised the CFO, HR., CIO and 
Civil Rights (EEO). I currently oversee a federal agency of 60 staff, 
both federal and contractors, with extensive financial and 
administrative responsibilities.

    12. The Government Performance and Results Act requires all 
government departments and agencies to identify measurable performance 
goals and to report to Congress on their success in achieving these 
goals.

    a) What benefits, if any, do you see in identifying performance 
goals and reporting on progress in achieving those goals?

    The GPRA was conceived as a tool to strengthen government 
performance and it has been increasingly used to improve overall 
government performance and make it more accountable to the public.

    b) What steps should Congress consider taking when a department/
agency fails to achieve its performance goals? Should these steps 
include the elimination, privatization, downsizing, or consolidation of 
departments and/or programs?

    If an agency fails to achieve its performance goals, Congress can 
investigate the underlying reasons (budget, staffing, competency, 
economic trends) and address them through continued oversight.

    c) What performance goals do you believe should be applicable to 
your personal performance, if confirmed?

    The Chair of the NIGC is not only the chief regulator and 
operations manager, but also must do so while advancing the public 
interest. Performance measures would include an assessment of strategic 
and operational alignment of the NIGC to its statutory and regulatory 
directives, effective management of NIGC's financial and human 
resources, and discernable confirmation that the NIGC's priorities, 
progress. and outcomes advance the larger public interest.

    13. Please describe your philosophy of supervisor/employee 
relationships. Generally, what supervisory model do you follow? Have 
any employee complaints been brought against you?

    I generally adhere to a collaborative approach to supervision that 
entails the supervisor and employee problem-solving together to come up 
with the best approach to work through issues. I also appreciate that 
compliance-based supervision is required in positions and industries 
that have high levels of accountability (financial, regulation, legal). 
One EEO complaint is pending in the Administration for Children and 
Families against the office of the Administration for Native Americans 
brought by an employee who I do not directly supervise.

    14. Describe your working relationship, if any, with the Congress. 
Does your professional experience include working with committees of 
Congress? If yes, please explain.

    I believe it is important to have a good and productive working 
relationships with Congress and I strive to do so. I have provided 
testimony to the Senate and House on separate occasions, and in my 
current position as Commissioner of the Administration for Native 
Americans at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, I 
recently testified before this Committee at an oversight hearing on May 
22, 2024, titled, ``Examining Public Safety and Justice Resources in 
Native Communities.''

    15. Please explain what you believe to be the proper relatiousbip 
between yourself, if confirmed, and the Inspector General of your 
department/agency.

    It would be my duty to assist and cooperate with the Inspector 
General (IG) personnel in the course of an investigation, audit, 
evaluation, or other IG review, as well as to ensure adherence to roles 
preventing and detecting fraud, waste, and abuse.

    16. In the areas under the department/agency's jurisdiction to 
which you have been nominated, what legislative action(s) should 
Congress consider as priorities? Please state your personal views.

    If confirmed, I would look forward to working with Congress to 
ensure that the NIGC has the resources and authorities needed to 
address the needs of tribal governments in ensuring the continuity of 
their economic enterprises.

    17. Within your area of control, will you pledge to develop and 
implement a system that allocates discretionary spending in an open 
manner through a set of fair and objective established criteria? If 
yes, please explain what steps you intend to take and a timeframe for 
their implementation. If no please explain why.

    Yes. If there is room for discretionary spending in the NIGC 
budget, I will use the opportunity to consult with staff and 
stakeholders to discuss administrative and program priorities and 
attempt to distribute the funds according to highest and best use, 
while ensuring no fraud and abuse occurs in the process.

                           g. financial data
    [Information not released to the public.]

    The Chairman. Thank you very much.
    I will defer to the Senator from Minnesota, Senator Smith.
    Senator Smith. Thank you very much, Senator Schatz. That is 
very kind of you. Thank you again, Ms. Kunesh, for being with 
us today.
    I appreciate your opening statement and also the ways in 
which the Chair and Vice Chair highlighted some of the 
opportunities as well as some of the risks around Indian 
gaming. You have a unique perspective, having been engaged in 
this for quite a long time.
    Let me just dive in a bit on what you identified as your 
sort of second priority, which is to minimize the risks of the 
new technology. Could you talk a bit about how you see that 
from the perspective of cybersecurity and also artificial 
intelligence? With cybersecurity, one of the most pressing 
issues in gaming today, tribes are in the difficult position of 
trying to react to existing threats and also prepare for new, 
emerging threats.
    So could you talk a bit about the state of play as you see 
it around cybersecurity issues in tribal gaming, and what 
actions you would recommend we should be thinking about as we 
address this challenge?
    Ms. Kunesh. Thank you for that really important question, 
Senator. I do see that technology has completely changed the 
way that the games are being played, literally, with online 
gaming, sports betting, the platforms on which we actually 
handle gaming. Handheld digital devices as well as remote 
gaming.
    With new technologies, there is an urgent need that the 
NIGC stay ahead of the technology with its regulations. By 
that, I see the need to really look into a strong view of what 
risks are occurring around the safety and security of gaming. I 
think that is one of the most important responsibilities of the 
NIGC.
    We know that in just a few decades, online gaming has 
surged in both popularity and profitability. Along with online 
gaming comes new platforms for financial engagement and 
financial transactions. So tribes, tribal gaming operations are 
now holding vast amounts of data, personal, sensitive 
information on their customers, but also responsible for 
ensuring the security of financial transactions.
    So if confirmed for this position, I think it would be one 
of my top concerns, my top priorities, to do an assessment of 
NIGC to evaluate their technology infrastructure, their 
technology work and programs, to make sure that a full risk 
assessment is done to identify any weaknesses.
    We know also with the $41.9 billion, as Senator Murkowski 
mentioned, that gaming profitability is increasing. That also 
weighs on a significant responsibility to make sure that the 
gaming industry, which has now become a financial industry, is 
safe and secure. In my experience working at the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, cybersecurity was their number one 
concern, and investments were ever-increasing, not just in 
terms of financial investments, but the infrastructure around 
ensuring the systems are safe, secure, and reliable.
    And we do know that reputation is everything in this 
industry. So any breach would cause tremendous damage. So I 
take that very seriously, and it would be a top priority for 
me.
    Senator Smith. Thank you. Could you also address, when we 
met last week, I think it was last week we talked a bit about 
the impact, potential impacts, of artificial intelligence in 
gaming. Could you address that as well in the little bit of 
time that we have left?
    Ms. Kunesh. Yes, certainly. Artificial intelligence is 
changing everything that we do in terms of our engagement and 
the artificial ways that, not that I understand it completely, 
but the technology within our AI is really changing the way we 
engage in acquiring that knowledge, pulling us further and 
further into certain behaviors.
    But it is also changing the way that we do business. We can 
use it in a smart way, learning to do things more efficiently, 
more uniformly, more standardized. We can also use artificial 
intelligence to analyze data, and data analytics is an 
incredible tool to understanding the risks on the other side of 
the gaming industry.
    So I think that the regulatory standards around technology 
generally, online gaming, AI, really need to be a strong focus 
of the NIGC.
    Senator Smith. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    The Chairman. Vice Chair Murkowski?
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Ms. Kunesh, thank you for responding to that question about 
cyber security. I think that overlays over so much of what we 
are discussing when we are talking about the threats to gaming.
    But I think we recognize that while the primary influence 
of NIGC is to ensure the integrity of Indian gaming, it is also 
to protect it from criminal influence. As I suggested in my 
opening comments, I worry about those who have been targeted 
for human and sex trafficking. Unfortunately, tribal and non-
tribal casinos have been known to be targeted for that.
    The Not Invisible Commission that Senator Cortez Masto and 
I worked on recommended addressing this through awareness and 
targeted prevention at casinos. I do understand that NIGC 
partners with tribes, BIA and DHS on initiatives like the Blue 
Campaign toolbox that educates the tribal casino and hotel 
managers on how you spot and then how you report suspected 
human trafficking at their establishments.
    Can you speak a little bit to this issue, and whether you 
think there are other initiatives that NIGC could look to on 
this issue of human trafficking and the challenges? Also, 
whether there is more that the partner agencies can be doing to 
address these issues. Unfortunately, those of us on the 
Committee here know that our Native populations are at far too 
high a risk when it comes to being potential victims of 
trafficking and human abuse.
    Ms. Kunesh. Thank you for that question, Senator. I do know 
that you have been a real champion in this space as well. It 
has made a difference.
    In my experience, having worked in this space for quite a 
while, human trafficking, missing and murdered indigenous 
women, violence against women, are some of the worst scourges 
in Indian Country today. Unfortunately, Native women, Native 
people tend to be the most vulnerable and susceptible to these 
terrible situations.
    I take the responsibility to prevent violence against women 
and addressing MMIP issues very seriously. In my current role 
as ANA Commissioner, I serve on the Not Invisible Act 
Commission. I was part of the hearings; I was also part of the 
drafting of the report and recommendations.
    Very specifically, we targeted my agency, the 
Administration for Children and Families, with more than 100 
recommendations to focus on these areas to intervene and 
prevent, to take action and then to support the survivors and 
the victims with appropriate services.
    So if I were confirmed for this position, I would like to 
build on the work of NIGC to strengthen the focus of their 
activities in this area. It is part of the NIGC's overall 
public safety responsibility to ensure that the gaming premises 
are safe and secure. That means safe and secure from illegal 
activity like human trafficking.
    I did ask a colleague of mine who oversees the Office of 
Trafficking in Persons at ACF about what we know about the 
intersection of human trafficking and gaming. There is not much 
data on it, unfortunately. I think that is one area that I 
would like to focus on, is understanding that data better 
between DHS and DOJ, and the work that we do on the ground at 
ACF, to really understand what the magnitude or the prevalence 
is.
    Senator Murkowski. Let me ask you, and I know you have to 
get confirmed before you can do any or all of this, but I 
appreciate what you have just said there with these data gaps. 
That was one of the things that we learned very, very clearly 
in the work that we did together on the Not Invisible, so much 
of the challenge that we faced is that we didn't know what we 
didn't know. When it came to murdered, missing and indigenous, 
it was actually the report out of Canada that first 
precipitated the investigation by the Seattle Indian Health 
Board.
    But we have learned a lot since then about these gaps in 
data. So if you are confirmed, I would hope that you not only 
would commit to trying to understanding a little bit more about 
these gaps, but then reporting back to the Committee with us on 
that to see if there isn't more that we need to be doing from a 
legislative response.
    I think this is an issue we need to know more about, to 
know the extent of the issue, and if there are different 
avenues we can work to address it. So I look forward to that.
    Ms. Kunesh. Absolutely, Senator. I would very much 
appreciate the opportunity to look at this and to work with you 
and report back to the full Committee.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Vice Chair Murkowski.
    A couple of my questions were taken, so I am going to go in 
a slightly different direction. Good discussion about 
cybersecurity and hardening the defenses of gaming operations, 
I get all of that.
    I guess I am wondering whether, bluntly, my intuition is 
that now that gambling is ubiquitous, that there may be small 
casinos that end up having difficulty staying afloat on the 
brick and mortar side. I want to talk about the long term 
fiscal risks for tribal governments. I get that there has been 
a spike, because everyone has been gambling more. But I also 
think that that could sort in a way that consolidates to the 
big dogs and away from some tribal governments who are doing 
apps and all the rest.
    So I think they are surviving, and even thriving now. But 
to me, the long-term trajectory, to the extent that you have 
your destinations like Las Vegas and a few other spots, and my 
understanding is a lot of their revenue is now non-gaming 
revenue and it is sort of an experience.
    But the idea that you would fly into--I am not going to 
name the town--but you would fly into a city, you have a 
conference, and then you go on Google and find the nearest 
casino, which is likely to be on reservation land, I am not 
sure that the market is going to stay the same. I am quite 
worried about that. I am wondering whether my intuition is 
wrong, or whether we know the answer to that.
    Ms. Kunesh. Chairman Schatz, I think your intuition is spot 
on. I think it is something that we really need to take a look 
at, because gaming revenue is so vitally important to tribes 
and to tribal economies for those essential services.
    My understanding is that the changes in technology are 
making gaming, as you said, more ubiquitous. But the 
interaction really is a very important component as well, not 
only where it is done, but how it is done. I should say how it 
is done and where it is done.
    My understanding of the range of new gaming formats like 
sports betting is also opening up opportunities for smaller 
tribes who may be in remote locations to be able to participate 
and diversify their gaming operations. Of course, that depends 
on the State law in the State in which the tribe is located.
    I also see that in gaming, it itself has to diversify in 
terms of the human experience, the brick and mortar facilities. 
It is a destination, as you mentioned, and customers go there 
for relaxation, entertainment and so forth. So as much as it is 
becoming popular and profitable from an NIGC perspective, we 
want to make sure that across the board, the tribes are well-
regulated in whatever form of gaming they do.
    The Chairman. So I know you are the regulator, and not the 
promoter. But I am wondering whether you consider it an 
appropriate function for the agency that you will lead to kind 
of do a market analysis. I am not persuaded--it is not that I 
am disagreeing with you, I am just not sure we know.
    I think there are certainly States that a competitive 
advantage that a tribe may have is as simple as, it is the only 
place it is legal, right? And it is legal pretty much 
everywhere now, at least using your iPhone.
    To me, I am a little more worried than others about what 
this is going to mean over the long term. If it is not your 
agency, then let's get our heads together and figure out who 
can do some analysis and figure out, is there a path forward to 
increased profitability and more scale, because the internet is 
going to make this available to everybody, and tribes are well-
positioned? That is the optimist scenario.
    There is another scenario where, as I said, private equity 
says, we are going to consolidate this darned thing, we are 
going to have the best app, the cheapest app, the lowest 
percentages that we take off the top. And we are just going to 
get to scale, and anyone who wants to do sports betting is 
going to use the app that is in the app store that is the 
easiest and most commonly found, and not go to a tribal app.
    So I am worried. I am not sure anyone else is worried. So I 
hope I am wrong. I don't mind being wrong on this one. But 
let's do some analysis and get some smart people who understand 
the industry in the room to figure out whether we are about to 
fall off a cliff as it relates to gaming revenue.
    Ms. Kunesh. I definitely agree, market analysis is 
appropriate and likely necessary to really understand where 
this is going in the next few years. One of the things that the 
NIGC does do is provide training and technical assistance. So 
to the extent this new technology is changing dramatically the 
state of gaming, I think there would be some discourse and 
dialogue about what the impact means.
    The Chairman. Okay. I would encourage anybody who is 
watching this, if I have it wrong, just email my staff and I 
will be happy to read it.
    [Laughter.]
    The Chairman. Senator Hoeven?

                STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN HOEVEN, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA

    Senator Hoeven. Thanks for being here today, thanks for 
coming by and visiting with me yesterday. I appreciate it very 
much.
    As Senator Smith said, it is good to have you coming from 
our part of the world. We appreciate that very well, with your 
ties to North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota.
    A couple of questions. What would be your priorities, if 
confirmed? What is your one, two, three priorities?
    Ms. Kunesh. Number one would be getting in and taking a 
look at the staff and the resources the NIGC has. I understand 
there are about 130 employees that oversee this almost $42 
billion industry, working very closely with over 6,000 tribal 
regulators as well. So I really want to get an understanding of 
how the organization is situated and resourced.
    Number two, I would really want to take a look at the state 
of the regulations. We recently had new regulations promulgated 
that added online gaming options to the tribal gaming 
operations. I would really want to know how those are being 
implemented and any impact from those new regulations.
    And third, I would really want to take a look at the public 
safety areas that we talked about earlier, the work that NIGC 
is doing around human trafficking awareness and prevention, 
looking at the partners that we have and determining if we can 
do more and how do we actually really delve into that area, 
leaning hard.
    Senator Hoeven. You mentioned 6,000 tribal regulators. What 
is your thought in terms of building some kind of connection or 
rapport with them?
    Ms. Kunesh. Pardon me?
    Senator Hoeven. You mentioned 6,000 tribal regulators in 
the industry. How do you build some kind of relationship or 
rapport there with so many?
    Ms. Kunesh. The way I see it, in my experience as being in-
house counsel with the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe, the tribal 
regulators are on the ground, at the forefront. They are the 
primary regulators of their gaming operations. They are 
essential to ensuring the integrity of the operation and 
ensuring that the tribe are the primary beneficiaries of the 
gaming revenue.
    So the NIGC is a Federal regulator with the oversight audit 
investigation authority. I do see it as a partner. We need to 
make sure that with the 527 gaming operations that again, we 
have sufficient resources and are properly enforcing the gaming 
ordinances. But I do see it as a partnership and a necessary 
alliance to make sure that what is happening on the ground 
comports with the regulations.
    Senator Hoeven. I think the artificial intelligence issue 
was brought up by some of the Committee members earlier, and 
you referenced it as well. NIGC has a policy regarding AI.
    Have you had a chance to look at that? How would you 
approach that AI issue, both in terms of what they have done, 
and if you haven't had a chance to look at that yet, it might 
be hard to differentiate. But that is a big issue, it is a 
tough issue. It is complicated. How are you going to approach 
it?
    Ms. Kunesh. Thank you for that question. I am not at the 
NIGC, so I am not aware of how they are approaching AI. But 
from my experience, again, going back to the Minneapolis 
Federal Reserve and the work that we are doing in the Federal 
Government, where AI is coming into every facet, every 
component, every function of what we do, we need to know what 
it is, how it works, and to make sure there are human 
safeguards around whatever product comes of it.
    It can do really well in a lot of ways. But the margin of 
error, because it is artificial, I think is pretty great. How 
we use it and apply it, I think we need to know that there are 
safeguards in place.
    Senator Hoeven. If somebody asked you, are you in favor of 
expanding Indian gaming or not expanding it, I understand your 
role is as regulator, but how do you answer that? How do you 
address that? It is a very dynamic environment, right?
    Ms. Kunesh. It is a very dynamic environment.
    Senator Hoeven. That is the challenge right now, figuring 
that out.
    Ms. Kunesh. Thank you for that, Senator. It is a very 
dynamic environment, and I go back and think about the Indian 
Gaming Regulatory Act, which provided, I thought, a very, very 
good framework and blueprint for addressing any sort of 
functions of gaming. Surprisingly well, it has folded in online 
gaming, digital gaming, and sports betting.
    So I haven't done any sort of full assessment of the Act. 
But what I have seen, what I have a sense of is that it is 
working well.
    What I would be committed to, Senator, is understanding, 
again, the dynamics and the pressures and tensions on the law, 
and working with you and this Committee to see if there need to 
be any legislative changes going forward.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Before I turn to the senior Senator from 
Nevada, I just wanted to compliment her and Senator Rosen on 
their work on both the Tribal Law Enforcement Act and this 
Bureau of Justice issue that we are having, not just in Nevada, 
but a couple of other States. We are not done yet, but we are 
making good progress, and I really appreciate your leadership.
    Senator Cortez Masto.

           STATEMENT OF HON. CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA

    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. Thank you to the Chair as 
well for the help you have provided us in addressing this issue 
in Nevada.
    It is great to see you. Thanks for visiting with me. 
Congratulations on your nomination.
    Ms. Kunesh. Thank you.
    Senator Cortez Masto. There is no doubt: I think you are 
well qualified, based on your background and the conversations 
we have, particularly around Nevada. So as somebody who was 
born and raised and actually worked with the attorney who 
represented our gaming control board and gaming commission, I 
have an appreciation for the work you are going to be doing. So 
I thank you for taking this on.
    My first question, though, goes back to what Senator Hoeven 
talked about. In Nevada, having a gaming license is a 
privilege. With that privilege comes background investigation 
and auditing. We have a gaming control board and a gaming 
commission. The commission does the licensing, the control 
board does the auditing.
    You are doing both. And you have a small staff. In Nevada, 
our auditors, there are probably about, right now in the gaming 
control board, last time I looked, 98 in total, and there are 
144 casinos.
    What you just talked about, and correct me if I am wrong, 
you have a total of 121 full-time employees and you are 
covering over 500 tribally owned casinos. That is a big task, 
not just the licensing piece of it and the background checks, 
but the auditing, which is what we want to maintain the 
integrity of the Indian gaming industry.
    I would hope as you get there that you will come back and 
talk to us if you need more resources. This is key as we are 
moving into the conversation that we just talked about around 
sports betting, online betting, sports wagering. These are new 
areas, even for Nevada as we go into some of the online gaming, 
things that we are learning and our commissions are actively 
engaged in.
    As you continue to move through this process, please come 
back to us and talk to us about the needs that you have, okay?
    Ms. Kunesh. Absolutely. And thank you for raising that, 
Senator Cortez Masto. I do believe the resources at NIGC are 
absolutely critical, again, to ensuring the integrity, 
safeguarding the public safety and so forth. It is my 
commitment, one of my top priorities, to really assess the need 
for additional staffing.
    One of the brilliant things that the NIGC can do is raise 
fees on a scale of more profitability, a little more funds for 
the NIGC, to pay for increased needs of the gaming commission. 
With increased responsibilities and the dynamic gaming 
environment, that may be needed. But I will definitely come 
back and share with you my findings and work with you in case 
there are any changes needed.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    And if you would talk about, we see the benefits, 
obviously, you and I have talked about the benefits to our 
tribal communities across the Country, about having the 
opportunity to operate casinos and the revenue it brings into 
those communities and the benefit it provides. Part of your 
mandate on the gaming commission really is to also help drive 
that economic development, find that balance, correct?
    Can you talk about why this is so important?
    Ms. Kunesh. It is definitely important, and one, tribes are 
the primary beneficiaries of the gaming revenue. But also that 
tribes are also able to use those funds to support essential 
governmental services. In my experience, again, going back to 
working with the Pequot Tribe and other tribes, these funds 
help support early childhood development programs, elder care 
services, educational scholarships. They support the 
infrastructure of the tribe itself to give it the backbone to 
be able to function as a tribe, to exercise its tribal 
sovereignty.
    One of the most, I think, important demonstrations of 
tribal sovereignty are the tribal courts. With the increase in 
gaming and the growth of gaming, for example, at the Pequot 
Tribe, we saw a really fundamental infrastructure develop 
around its judicial system. That supported not only the 
customers and patrons and employees of the gaming enterprise, 
it provided a judicial system for the tribal members 
themselves.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Yes. It has made such a difference, I 
have seen, across the Country.
    I am going to end with this. I agree with Senator 
Murkowski, the more information and data and education we can 
bring to our casinos and these types of establishments around 
human trafficking and the prevention of human trafficking and 
helping victims of human trafficking, I am all for it. I know 
you were on the commission, and I thank you for your work 
there.
    That is why I am pleased that you are going to carry that 
with you into this new position as well. It is key for us to 
really gather the data to have an understanding of the 
education piece of that. Everybody has a role to play, 
including our operators.
    So if there is an opportunity to continue that work where 
you are in this new position, we look forward to working with 
you.
    Ms. Kunesh. Thank you. I definitely support that, also I 
thank the Senate Committee for its work on law enforcement and 
public safety as well. Jurisdiction in Indian Country is very 
complex, and we do need more tribal law enforcement, and we do 
need coordination with DOJ and DHS when needed, and local law 
enforcement as well.
    So it is an all-of-government approach to ensure that 
reservations and Native people and the patrons of these 
facilities are safe and secure and protected as well.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Thank you. If there are no more questions 
from our members for the nominee, members may also submit 
follow-up written questions for the record. If we can do that 
promptly, that would be excellent.
    I would ask the nominee to respond fully and promptly to 
any follow-up questions, especially if you want to be confirmed 
quickly. And also to meet with any remaining Committee members 
who may wish to meet with you.
    The hearing record will be open for one week. We want to 
thank you for your time and you testimony today. This hearing 
is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

Hart Senate Office Building,
Washington, DC.

Dear Chairman Schatz and Vice Chair Murkowski,

    On behalf of the NAFOA, founded as the Native American Finance 
Officers Association, I am writing to express our strong support for 
Patrice H. Kunesh's nomination as Chair of the National Indian Gaming 
Commission (NIGC).
    Ms. Kunesh, a descendant of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, has 
demonstrated exceptional leadership and unwavering dedication to tribal 
communities throughout her distinguished career. Her current role as 
Commissioner of the Administration for Native Americans (ANA) and her 
previous roles--notably, as Deputy Solicitor at the U.S. Department of 
the Interior and founding Director of the Center for Indian Country 
Development at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis--underscore her 
profound expertise and commitment to tribal issues.
    Ms. Kunesh's extensive experience and leadership make her an ideal 
candidate to lead the NIGC. Her track record of enhancing tribal 
governance, advancing economic development, and providing increased 
support for Native programs speaks to her ability to effectively 
oversee and guide the Commission's work over the next three years.
    We urge you and your fellow Committee members to swiftly confirm 
Ms. Kunesh's nomination. Her unparalleled qualifications and steadfast 
commitment to our communities make her exceptionally well-suited for 
this critical role.
    Thank you for your prompt attention to this important matter.

        Sincerely,

Hon. Lisa Murkowski Vice Chair,
Senate Indian Affairs Committee,
Hart Senate Office Building,
Washington, DC.

Dear Chairman Schatz and Vice Chair Murkowski,

    On behalf of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe. I am writing to express 
our unequivocal and strong support for Patrice H. Kunesh's nomination 
as Chair of the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC). The Band 
celebrates this nomination as another indication of this 
Administration's commitment to better delivering upon trust and treaty 
obligations, and enhancing our diplomatic, Nation-to-Nation 
relationship.
    A descendant of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Ms. Kunesh has 
dedicated her career to the development of Tribal economies and the 
advancement of our inherent sovereignty. Previously, Ms. Kunesh 
established and led the Center for Indian Country Development at the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, an economic policy research center 
dedicated to Indian Country issues. She has also held appointments as 
the Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development at the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture and as the Deputy Solicitor for Indian Affairs at the 
Department of the Interior. In addition, she has served as in-house 
counsel to the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, and on the faculty at 
the University of South Dakota School of Law.
    As her distinguished career demonstrates, Ms. Kunesh is a well-
known advocate for the rebuilding of Tribal Nations and our economies. 
Her depth of experience and commitment to leadership in addressing 
Tribal concerns and issues makes Ms. Kunesh exceptionally prepared to 
serve as the next Chair of the NIGC.
    We call upon the United States Senate to act swiftly on Ms. 
Kunesh's confirmation in accordance with its responsibility to honor 
its trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations. Therefore, we 
respectfully urge you to work with your colleagues in the United States 
Senate to swiftly confirm Ms. Kunesh's nomination as Chair of NIGC.
    Thank you for your consideration and attention to this important 
matter.

        Sincerely,
     Hon. Virgil Wind, Chief Executive, Mille Lacs Band of

Dear Chairman Schatz and Vice Chair Murkowski,

    On behalf of the Rincon Band of Luiseno Indians (Rincon Band), I am 
writing to express our strong support for Patrice H. Kunesh's 
nomination as Chair of the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC).
    The NIGC plays a critical role regulating and supporting Indian 
gaming as a means of generating revenue for tribal communities. We 
believe that Ms. Kunesh would provide effective and principled 
leadership of the Commission.
    Ms. Kunesh, a descendant of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, has 
demonstrated exceptional and unwavering dedication to tribal 
communities throughout her distinguished career. Her current role as 
Commissioner of the Administration for Native Americans and her 
previous roles--notably, as Deputy Solicitor at the U.S. Department of 
the Interior and founding Director of the Center for Indian Country 
Development at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis--underscore her 
profound expertise and commitment to Indian Country.
    Ms. Kunesh's extensive experience and leadership make her an ideal 
candidate to lead the NIGC. Of note, she has significant experience 
with and understands the important of economic development in Indian 
Country. For most tribes, including the Rincon Band, Indian gaming has 
been an essential tool for economic development to sustain our 
communities, now and far into the future. The Rincon Band is keenly 
aware of the need for strong leadership at the NIGC. Our Tribe operates 
Harrah's Resort Southern California, which is the main source of 
government revenue for our Tribe. While our gaming operation has been 
very successful, achieving this success has not been easy and we have 
had to rely on our federal partners, including the NIGC for effective 
regulatory support and oversight.
    When the State of California was unwilling to engage in good faith 
compact negotiations with our Tribe, we were forced to seek Class III 
procedures from the Interior Department. More recently, the State was 
unwilling to cooperate in providing regulatory oversight under those 
procedures, so we negotiated a first-of-its-kind regulatory agreement 
with the NIGC in 2023. Under that agreement, all regulatory oversight 
for the Tribe's Class III gaming is provided by the NIGC instead of the 
State. This sort of arrangement would not be possible without strong 
leadership at the NIGC. Our Tribe firmly believes that Ms. Kunesh has 
the experience, judgment and temperament to continue to make the 
regulatory relationship with our Tribe a success.
    We urge you and your fellow members of the Senate to swiftly 
confirm Ms. Kunesh's nomination. Her unparalleled qualifications and 
steadfast commitment to our communities make her exceptionally well-
suited for this critical role.
    Thank you for your prompt attention to this important matter.

        Sincerely yours,
                          Hon. Bo Mazzetti, Tribal Chairman

   Re: Support for Swift Confirmation of Patrice Kunesh as 
                                            NIGC Chairwoman

Dv-laa-ha--Chairman Schatz,

    On behalf of the Tolowa Dee-ni' Nation, I am writing to strongly 
endorse Patrice Kunesh for the position of Chairwoman of the National 
Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC). Ms. Kunesh is an exceptionally 
qualified nominee, whose deep understanding of tribal sovereignty and 
extensive experience make her an outstanding candidate for this 
critical role.
    The relationship between Tribal Governments and the federal 
government is both unique and significant, grounded in treaties and 
legal commitments that must be honored. The NIGC plays an essential 
role in ensuring that tribal gaming is conducted with integrity and 
compliance with federal laws, while also promoting economic development 
and self-reliance within tribal communities. Effective leadership at 
the NIGC is crucial to protecting and advancing the interests of Tribal 
Governments and their citizens.
    Ms. Kunesh has dedicated her distinguished career to advocating for 
Native American rights and interests. Her legal expertise and 
unwavering commitment to tribal sovereignty and community well-being 
are evident in her work. In her current role as Commissioner for the 
Administration for Native Americans within the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services, where she also serves as Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Native Affairs and Chair of the HHS Intradepartmental 
Council on Native American Affairs, Ms Kunesh has acquired invaluable 
experience that will serve her well as Chairwoman of the NIGC.
    Ms. Kunesh' appointment would bring a wealth of expertise and deep 
commitment to advancing the principles of tribal sovereignty and self-
governance. Under her leadership the NIGC will continue to be a strong 
and effective partner to Tribal Governmentst, strengthening government-
to-government relationships between the United States and Tribal 
Nations. Moreover, her prompt confirmation is vital for the stability 
and growth of the tribal gaming sector, which is instrumental in 
supporting the economic and social well-being of Tribal Nations 
nationwide. Any delay in her confirmation could hinder the Commission's 
ability to operate at its full potential, affecting the regulation and 
oversight essential to safeguarding tribal interests.
    The Tolowa Dee-ni' Nation urges the Senate to move swiftly with the 
confirmation of Patrice Kunesh as Chairwoman of the NIGC. Her 
leadership is essential to the continued success and effectiveness of 
the NIGC, and we respectfully request your support for her 
confirmation.
    Shu' shaa nin-la, for your consideration.

        Sincerely,
                       Hon. Jeri Lynn Thompson, Chairperson

                                                     Kunesh

Dear Chairman Schatz,

    On behalf of the Match-E-B-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi 
Indians, I am writing to express our strong endorsement of Patrice 
Kunesh for the role of Chairwoman of the National Indian Gaming 
Commission (NIGC) and support for her swift confirmation by the Senate. 
Ms. Kunesh is a highly qualified nominee, whose profound understanding 
of tribal sovereignty, coupled with her extensive experience, makes her 
an outstanding candidate for this crucial position.
    Ms. Kunesh has dedicated her career to serving Indian Country, with 
a proven record of accomplishment of advocating for the rights and 
interests of tribes. Her legal expertise and deep understanding of the 
unique challenges facing tribal governments make her an excellent 
choice to lead the NIGC. Her previous roles, including her time as 
Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Devolopment at the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture and Assistant General Counsel at the Department of the 
Interior, highlight her commitment to public service and her respect 
for tribal sovereignty.
    The NIGC plays a critical role in ensuring that Indian gaming 
operations are conducted fairly, securely, and with integrity. Given 
the significant challenges currently facing Indian Country, 
particularly in protecting and expanding the economic benefits of 
gaming, the confirmation of Ms. Kunesh as NIGC Chairperson is more 
important than ever. Her extensive experience working directly with 
tribes, coupled with her leadership within the federal government, 
uniquely positions her to balance necessary federal oversight with 
respect for tribal self-determination.
    Ms, Kunesh's appointment will bring invaluable expertise and a deep 
commitment to upholding and advancing the principles of tribal 
sovereignty and self-governance. Her leadership at the NIGC would not 
only ensure the Commission's continued effectiveness but also 
strengthen the government-to-government relationships between the 
United States and Tribal Nations, Moreover, her timely confirmation is 
crucial for the ongoing stability and growth of the tribal gaming 
sector, which is instrumental in supporting the economic and social 
fabric of Tribal Nations across the country. Any delay in her 
confirmation could hinder the Commission's ability to operate at its 
full potential, thereby impacting the regulation and oversight 
necessary to safeguard tribal interests.
    We strongly urge the Senate to proceed swiftly with the 
confirmation of Patrice Kunesh as Chairwoman of the NIGC. Her 
leadership is crucial for the NIGC and will undoubtedly be of great 
benefit to all of Indian Country.
    We appreciate your consideration and respectfully request you and 
the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs support for her confirmation.

        Sincerely,

                                              Chair of NIGC

Dear Chairman Schatz and Vice Chair Murkowski,

    On behalf of the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community (SMSC), we 
are writing to express support for Patrice H. Kunesh's nomination for 
Chair of the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC).
    The SMSC is a federally recognized sovereign Native American tribe 
located in Minnesota. Tribal gaming remains critical among enterprises 
supporting our Community and other tribes bounded by the state of 
Minnesota. The economic opportunity it provides us is essential to 
protecting our interests. As such, the U.S. Senate's decision on NIGC 
leadership is of great importance to our people.
    The SMSC fully endorses President Biden's nomination of Patrice H. 
Kunesh and respectfully supports her confirmation in the Senate. 
Throughout her career, Ms. Kunesh has maintained an outstanding 
commitment to protecting tribal sovereignty, including her 
establishment of the Center for Indian Country Development at the 
Federal Reserve. Her support for tribal issues and advocacy for 
economic development in Indian Country make her well suited for this 
role.
    Thank you for your consideration of Ms. Kunesh for NIGC Chair. On 
behalf of the SMSC, I respectfully encourage her swift confirmation to 
support the continued success of our strong relationship with the NIGC.

        Sincerely,

Washington, DC.

Dear Chairman Schatz and Vice Chair Murkowski,

    On behalf of Calista Corporation, I am writing to express our 
strong support for Patrice H. Kunesh's nomination as Chair of the 
National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC).
    Ms. Kunesh, a descendant of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, has 
demonstrated exceptional leadership and unwavering dedication to tribal 
communities throughout her distinguished career. Her current role as 
Commissioner of the Administration for Native Americans (ANA) and her 
previous roles--notably, as Deputy Solicitor at the U.S. Department of 
the Interior and founding Director of the Center for Indian Country 
Development at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis--underscore her 
profound expertise and commitment to tribal issues.
    Ms. Kunesh's extensive experience and leadership make her an ideal 
candidate to lead the NIGC. Her track record of enhancing tribal 
governance, advancing economic development, and providing increased 
support for Native programs speaks to her ability to effectively 
oversee and guide the Commission's work over the next three years.
    We urge you and your fellow members of the Senate to swiftly 
confirm Ms. Kunesh's nomination. Her unparalleled qualifications and 
steadfast commitment to our communities make her exceptionally well-
suited for this critical role.
    Thank you for your prompt attention to this important matter.

        Sincerely,
                                  Andrew Guy, President/CEO

Washington, DC.

Dear Chairman Schatz and Vice Chair Murkowski,

    On behalf of the Central Council of Tlingit & Haida Indian Tribes 
of Alaska, I am writing to express our strong support for Patrice H. 
Kunesh's nomination as Chair of the National Indian Gaming Commission 
(NIGC). Tlingit & Haida celebrates this nomination as another 
indication of this Administration's commitment to better delivering 
upon trust and treaty obligations, and enhancing our diplomatic, 
Nation-to- Nation relationship.
    A descendant of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Ms. Kunesh has 
dedicated her career to the development of Tribal economies and the 
advancement of our inherent sovereignty. Previously, Ms. Kunesh 
established and led the Center for Indian Country Development at the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, an economic policy research center 
dedicated to Indian Country issues. She has also held appointments as 
the Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development at the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture and as the Deputy Solicitor for Indian Affairs at the 
Department of the Interior. In addition, she has served as in-house 
counsel to the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, and on the faculty at 
the University of South Dakota School of Law.
    As her distinguished career demonstrates, Ms. Kunesh is a well-
known advocate for the rebuilding of Tribal Nations and our economies. 
Her depth of experience and commitment to leadership in addressing 
Tribal concerns and issues makes Ms. Kunesh exceptionally prepared to 
serve as the next Chair of the NIGC.
    We call upon the United States Senate to act swiftly on Ms. 
Kunesh's confirmation in accordance with its responsibility to honor 
its trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations. Therefore, we 
respectfully urge you to work with your colleagues in the United States 
Senate to swiftly confirm Ms. Kunesh's nomination as Chair of NIGC.
    Gunalcheesh, Haw'aa thank you again for your consideration.

Dear Chairman Schatz and Vice Chair Murkowski,

    On behalf of the Coalition of Large Tribes, an intertribal 
organization representing the interests of the more than 50 tribes with 
reservations of 100,000 acres or more, encompassing more than 95 
percent of the Indian Country lands and more than half the Native 
American population, I am writing to express our strong support for 
Patrice H. Kunesh's nomination as Chair of the National Indian Gaming 
Commission (NIGC).
    Ms. Kunesh, a descendant of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, has 
demonstrated exceptional leadership and unwavering dedication to tribal 
communities throughout her distinguished career. Her current role as 
Commissioner of the Administration for Native Americans (ANA) and her 
previous roles-notably, as Deputy Solicitor at the U.S. Department of

oversee and guide the Commission's work over the next three years. In 
addition, she is a devoted public servant having committed herself to 
work for American Indians, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians 
throughout her career.
    We urge you and your fellow members of the Senate to swiftly 
confirm Ms. Kunesh's nomination. Her unparalleled qualifications and 
steadfast commitment to our communities make her exceptionally well-
suited for this critical role.
    Thank you for your prompt attention to this important matter.

Honorable Senators,

    The Minnesota Indian Affairs Council is writing in support of the 
nomination of Patrice Kunesh for Commissioner of the National Indian 
Gaming Commission (NIGC). It is vital that the next NIGC Commissioner 
have both the educational background and the relationship skills 
necessary to work with Tribal Nations. Ms. Kunesh, as a skilled 
attorney, possess' the legal knowledge to guide and lead the complex 
nature of Native American Gaming. Ms. Kunesh understands how to balance 
industry with regulation and Native American vitality with federal 
oversite. A skill rarely found outside oflndian country. As Native 
American woman, Ms. Kunesh understands that successful Native American 
gaming industries are unlike non-Native American enterprises, in that, 
relationships and trust are core principles that must upheld in all 
spaces.
    Ms. Kunesh understands the impact of these industtjes on both 
Native American and Non-Native American communities. For Native 
American communities--the gaming enterprises play a critical role in 
preserving sovereignty, Tribal Nation revitalization, self-
determination, and economic sustainability. For non-Native American 
communities--the revenue generated from these enterprises have 
contributed to many vital services across the nation including 
education, philanthropy, research, local economies, healthcare, and 
employment.
    It is of great importance that this good work can continue and 
thrive under the next NIGC commissioner, and we, the Minnesota Indian 
Affairs Council recommend that the Nomination of Patrice Kunesh be 
confirmed.

        Pidamaya, Thank you,

Dear Majority Leader Schumer and Minority Leader McConnell:

    On behalf of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians (Red Lake 
Nation), I am writing to express our strong support for Patrice H. 
Kunesh's nomination as Chair of the National Indian Gaming Commission 
(NIGC) and urge you as Majority and Minority Leaders of the U.S. Senate 
to bring her nomination to the Senate floor as soon as possible.
    As a descendant of the Standing Rock-Sioux Tribe, Ms. Kunesh has 
demonstrated exceptional leadership and unwavering dedication to tribal 
communities throughout her distinguished career. Her current role as 
Commissioner of the Administration for Native Americans (ANA) and her 
previous roles underscores her profound expertise and commitment to 
tribal issues. Of note, Ms. Kunesh began her legal career at the Native 
American Rights Fund and served as in-house Counsel for the 
Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation. Ms. Kunesh has also served on the 
faculty at the University of South Dakota School of Law and held 
appointments as the Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development at the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture, Deputy Solicitor for Indian Affairs at 
the Department of the Interior, and as a member of the Treasury 
Community Development Advisory Board (CDFI Fund). She also established 
the Center for Indian Country Development--an economic policy research 
initiative at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis rights here in 
our home state--and founded Pehirj Haha Consulting, a social enterprise 
committed to fostering culturally-centered Native economic development.
    Ms. Kunesh's extensive experience and leadership make her an ideal 
candidate to lead the NIGC. We urge you and your fellow members of the 
Senate to swiftly confirm Ms. Kunesh's nomination in accordance with 
your trust responsibility to Tribal governments. Her unparalleled 
qualifications and steadfast commitment to our communities make her 
exceptionally well-suited for this critical role and we look forward to 
working with her in this position.

        Sincerely,
                 Hon. Darrell G. Seki, Sr., Tribal Chairman
                                 "_____
                                 
    Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. John Hoeven to 
                         Hon. Patrice H. Kunesh
    Question 1. Four years after leaving your position as counsel for 
the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe of Connecticut, the Tribe's Foxwood's 
Casino was forced to restructure its debt because of dropping revenues 
and overextending itself on facility expansion. During your time 
advising the tribe, how did you protect against the losses that 
eventually led the tribe to terminate per capita payments to tribal 
members and the eventual establishment of federal social service 
programs within a tribal community that at one time was one of the 
wealthiest tribes in the country?
    Answer. During the period following my departure from the 
Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, the United States suffered a severe 
economic downturn. Lasting from December 2007 to June 2009, this 
economic contraction was the longest since World War II, ultimately 
becoming deep enough and protracted enough to acquire the label ``the 
Great Recession.'' Most tribal governments with gaming enterprises were 
impacted significantly during the Great Recession.
    The Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation has continually pursued 
opportunities to diversify its economic development, including 
encouraging private opportunities among its citizens. Economic 
diversification has many benefits, including resilience, growth, and 
poverty reduction. This is directly related to tribal economies, which 
often rely on gaming revenue for essential government services. A 
diversified economy is better able to withstand external shocks and 
economic downturns. By avoiding reliance on a single industry sector, 
diversification can lead to faster economic growth, job creation, and 
higher incomes, which can help reduce poverty and inequality.

    Question 2. During your nomination hearing, you identified 
cybersecurity as a top priority and testified that you would ``do an 
assessment of NIGC to evaluate their technology infrastructure. . .to 
make sure a full risk assessment is done to identify any weaknesses.'' 
The NIGC currently offers IT vulnerability assessments to any tribes 
that request assistance. How would your cybersecurity priorities differ 
from the policies the Commission is currently implementing?
    Answer. New technologies have transformed the gaming industry, and 
as I stated at my hearing, if confirmed as Chair of the NIGC, 
mitigating the risks resulting from this influx of new technologies 
will be one of my top priorities. Cybersecurity is critical as tribal 
gaming operations must now protect a high volume of financial and 
customer data due to the increased popularity and profitability of 
online gaming. Plus, as technology is ever evolving, so too is the 
gaming industry, presenting another challenge to cybersecurity.
    IGRA directs the NIGC to participate in training and technical 
assistance, and I believe that training is important to mitigate 
cybersecurity risks. While I am not at the NIGC and do not know the 
specifics of the IT vulnerability assessments that the NIGC offers to 
Tribes, if confirmed as NIGC Chair, I commit to learning more about the 
status of these assessments and build on the work that the NIGC has 
already done in this space to ensure that NIGC provides Tribes with up-
to-date specialized training to keep pace with the ever-evolving gaming 
industry.

    Question 3. During your nomination hearing you discussed the idea 
of raising fees on tribal gaming operations. Can you please explain 
further the justification or reasoning for the increase, how they would 
be applied, and will you commit to consulting with tribes before 
raising fees?
    Answer. I believe that securing adequate resources for the NIGC's 
oversight responsibilities are absolutely critical to ensuring the 
integrity of Indian gaming, including public health and safety. If 
confirmed, one of my top priorities will be to assess the need for 
additional staffing, and if additional resources are warranted, I 
commit to working with you and members of this Committee to address 
those needs. I further commit to ensuring regular and meaningful 
consultation with Tribes in carrying out the responsibilities of the 
Commission.

    Question 4. I am a co-sponsor of S. 1328--the Tribal Labor 
Sovereignty Act. This legislation is endorsed by both the National 
Congress of American Indians and the Indian Gaming Association. TLSA is 
a simple amendment to the National Labor Relations Act that supports 
tribal sovereignty by exempting tribal governments, much the same as 
state and local governments, from being subject to the NLRA. Would you 
support efforts, like the TLSA, which supports prioritizing tribal laws 
and regulations over the overburdensome and one size fits all federal 
approach that the NLRA currently exercises over tribes?
    Answer. Promoting tribal sovereignty and economic development is 
important to me. If I am honored to be confirmed, I will listen to all 
stakeholders to understand the impacts of legislative efforts such as 
this, and I look forward to working with you to better understand the 
details and implications of your legislation. Further, if confirmed, I 
commit to working with this Committee in a collaborative and 
transparent way to achieve our mutual goals.

    Question 5. With your background focused on expanding economic 
opportunities in Indian Country and connecting tribes to resources, how 
do you plan to take on a regulatory role that is tasked with ensuring 
tribal gaming adheres to the regulatory framework articulated by 
Congress in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act?
    Answer. Indian gaming is a robust industry that supports 
reservation economies and contributes to the health and well-being of 
Native peoples. To maintain this success, I believe it is paramount 
that the industry is well-regulated and well-positioned for the next 
era of Indian gaming. Through my previous positions as a law 
practitioner, a government attorney, and a legal scholar, I have gained 
extensive knowledge and experience with the laws and regulations 
concerning Indian gaming, which will serve me well if I am confirmed.

    Question 6. You stated during your hearing that your number one 
priority, if confirmed, would be to first gain an understanding of the 
role and the inner workings of the current staff. How do you plan to 
transition into this role without prior experience in the gaming 
industry?
    Answer. Through my previous positions as a law practitioner, a 
government attorney, and a legal scholar, I have extensive knowledge 
and experience with the laws and regulations concerning Indian gaming. 
Whenever I take on a new role, of which I have had many throughout my 
career, one of the first things that I do is talk to the team. If 
confirmed, I will do just that, and will work closely with NIGC staff 
to get up to speed on the inner workings of the NIGC.
                                 ______
                                 
   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Ben Ray Lujan to 
                         Hon. Patrice H. Kunesh
    Honorable Patrice Kunesh, I am glad to see your extensive 
background and experience on issues that are important to Tribal 
communities around the country. However, one issue that often gets 
overlooked in discussions about the Commission's role is how we can 
ensure that gaming facilities are not used to aid and harbor illegal 
activities such as human trafficking.

    Question 1. Ms. Kunesh, how can the Commission work with our Gaming 
Facilities and Tribal Communities to ensure that they are safe and 
secure environments for their customers and the surrounding 
communities?
    Answer. This issue is very important to me, and as I stated during 
my hearing, I have worked to prevent human trafficking and violence 
again women throughout my career. The NIGC is required by statute to 
refer criminal matters to the appropriate law enforcement agency, and 
it has an oversight responsibility to protect the public health and 
safety at Indian gaming establishments. If confirmed, I would like to 
build upon the work the NIGC has already done and bring together the 
various stakeholders, such as the tribal regulatory community and the 
criminal law enforcement community, to look at targeted issues like 
human trafficking. That way, the NIGC will continue to promote best 
practices and be available to help Tribes and tribal policymakers as 
they determine how to address this issue at the local level in their 
community.

    Question 2. Do you feel that there is more that the Commission can 
be doing to help address this issue?
    Answer. As I mentioned during my hearing, I believe collecting and 
analyzing data to understand the intersection between human trafficking 
and gaming is important. If confirmed, I will work with Tribes, law 
enforcement agencies, other Federal agencies, Congress, and other 
stakeholders, as appropriate, to gather this data and use the 
information to prevent human trafficking.

    Question 3. As Chair, do I have your commitment to make this issue 
a top priority during your term?
    Answer. Yes. Preventing human trafficking and violence against 
women is a responsibility that I take very seriously, and, as I have 
stated, this will remain a top priority for me if I am confirmed.
                                 ______
                                 
  Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Markwayne Mullin to 
                         Hon. Patrice H. Kunesh
    Question 1. The Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act has been introduced in 
either the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, or both, 
since the 110th Congress. Do you support this legislation? If so, why? 
If not, why not?
    Answer. Promoting tribal sovereignty and economic development is 
important to me. If I am confirmed, I will listen to all stakeholders 
to understand the impacts of efforts such as this, and I look forward 
to working with you and others to better understand the details and 
implications of this legislation. Further, if confirmed, I commit to 
working with members of this Committee in a collaborative and 
transparent way to achieve our mutual goals.

    Question 2. You have noted that you have worked for Casey Family 
Programs in a research and writing capacity. Did any of your work at 
Casey Family Programs touch upon the subject of Indian gaming? If yes, 
please describe.

    Answer. My research and writing for the Casey Family Programs 
concerned elements of trauma and trauma-informed care and resulted in 
publications for the National Native Child Trauma Center at the 
University of Montana.
    Question 3. At any point during your service as a Staff Attorney at 
the Native American Rights Fund, did you handle any matter(s) related 
to Indian gaming? If yes, please describe.
    Answer. As a staff attorney at the Native American Rights Fund 
(NARF), I represented tribal governments that had gaming enterprises. 
My work involved matters such as constitutional reform, tribal law 
development, and litigation related to jurisdictional disputes. As a 
matter of general policy, NARF does not directly engage in cases 
involving gaming.

    Question 4. At any point during your service as Legal Counsel at 
the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, did you handle any matter(s) 
related to Indian gaming? If yes, please describe.
    Answer. As legal counsel to the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, 
I engaged in a range of issues, including matters concerning the scope 
and extent of the Tribe's jurisdiction involving activities related to 
the gaming enterprise, and tribal law and court development such as a 
tort law for cases arising at the gaming enterprise. I also 
participated in tribal tax and financing activities, including matters 
concerning the general welfare exemption.

    Question 5. At any point during your service as a Leadership Fellow 
at the Bush Foundation, did you handle any matter(s) related to Indian 
gaming? If yes, please describe.
    Answer. I used my fellowship to pursue a Master of Public 
Administration at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. During this 
time, I completed an independent study project on data involving 
violence in Indian Country to better understand both geographic and law 
enforcement perspectives of the impacts of this violence.

    Question 6. At any point during your service as Deputy Solicitor--
Indian Affairs at the U.S. Department of the Interior, did you handle 
any matter(s) related to Indian gaming? If yes, please describe.
    Answer. In the general course of my responsibilities as Deputy 
Solicitor, I worked on issues including Indian land determinations and 
review of gaming compacts. I also regularly engaged with the General 
Counsel for the National Indian Gaming Commission. In addition, I 
worked with the Department of Justice as agency counsel in a gaming-
related matter before the United States Supreme Court.

    Question 7. At any point during your service as Director of the 
Center for Indian Country Development, at the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Minneapolis, did you handle any matter(s) related to Indian gaming? If 
yes, please describe.
    Answer. At the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, I was involved 
in research concerning the impact of tribal economies on areas such as 
access to capital, housing, and education, as well as economic 
diversification. This research often included analysis of issues 
related to tribal gaming. I also led research on urban violence against 
Native people.

    Question 8. At any point during your work at Pehinf Haha 
Consulting, did you handle any matter(s) related to Indian gaming? If 
yes, please describe.
    Answer. I did not handle matters specifically related to tribal 
gaming at Pehinf Haha Consulting. One of my clients was the Economic 
Policy Institute, where I dealt with global issues regarding the impact 
of tribal economies on areas such as access to capital, housing, and 
education, as well as economic diversification.

    Question 9. At any point during your most recent service at the 
Native American Rights Fund, did you handle any matter(s) related to 
Indian gaming? If yes, please describe.
    Answer. At the Native American Rights Fund, a public interest law 
firm whose mission is to protect Native rights, resources and lifeways, 
I worked on issues including waters rights, tribal governance, and 
child welfare.

    Question 10. At any point during your service as Commissioner at 
the Administration for Native Americans, did you handle any matter(s) 
related to Indian gaming? If yes, please describe.
    Answer. The Administration for Native Americans (ANA) makes vital 
investments in Native communities to enhance the social and economic 
well-being of Native Americans, Alaskan Natives, Native Hawaiians, and 
indigenous people of the Pacific Islands. As Commissioner, I have not 
handled a matter at the ANA related to Indian gaming.

    Question 11. To better understand the extent of your on-the-ground 
experience in Tribal gaming, and speaking generally, do you now, or 
have you ever, spent time in one or more Tribal gaming facilities--in 
either a personal or professional capacity?
    Answer. During my tenure with the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal 
Nation, I spent time at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in a professional 
capacity. In addition, throughout my career in my professional 
capacity, I have attended numerous business meetings held at tribal 
casinos across the country. When I visit family at Standing Rock in my 
personal capacity, I often stay at the hotel at the Prairie Knights 
Casino and Resort.

    Question 12. How do you believe Artificial Intelligence will affect 
the Tribal gaming industry?
    Answer. New technology is changing how games are being played and, 
as with all technology, it is important that the NIGC ensures that 
regulatory standards do not lag behind as artificial intelligence (AI) 
advances. As I stated during my hearing, AI is changing how companies 
do business and presents a number of benefits, such as being a great 
data analytic tool. Based on my experience at the Minneapolis Federal 
Reserve and in the Federal government, however, I believe it is 
important that there are proper safeguards in place to protect against 
the potential downsides of AI. If confirmed as NIGC Chair, working on 
issues related to new technology, such as AI, will be a high priority 
for me, and I would work closely with NIGC staff, Tribes, and 
technology experts to understand the impacts of the changing 
technological landscape on gaming.

    Question 13. How do you intend to use your position as Chairwoman 
at the NIGC to address matters related to human trafficking?
    Answer. Preventing human trafficking and violence against women is 
a responsibility that I take very seriously, and I have worked on these 
issues throughout my career.
    The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act requires the NIGC to refer 
criminal matters to the appropriate law enforcement agency. It is also 
the NIGC's oversight responsibility to ensure that Tribes protect the 
public health and safety in Indian gaming premises, including from the 
threat of human trafficking. If confirmed as Chair of the NIGC, one of 
my top priorities will be continuing the NIGC's efforts to combat human 
trafficking in Indian gaming facilities. Within NIGC's authority, I 
would promote best practices to help Tribes address these issues at the 
local level and ensure that any criminal activity is reported to the 
appropriate law enforcement authorities as required by law. Also, as I 
touched on in the hearing, I believe it is important to utilize data to 
better understand the intersection between human trafficking and gaming 
and to identify any potential data gaps. If confirmed as Chair of the 
NIGC, I commit to learning more about what data is available and 
working with you and members of this Committee to combat human 
trafficking.

    Question 14. At any point during your time as an attorney in 
private practice, have you handled any matter(s) related to Indian 
gaming? If yes, please describe.
    Answer. As I stated at my hearing, I served on the faculty at the 
University of South Dakota School of Law, where I taught courses on 
federal Indian law and gaming. However, as an attorney in private 
practice and at Pehinf Haha Consulting, I did not handle matters 
specifically related to Indian gaming.

   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Lisa Murkowski to 
                         Hon. Patrice H. Kunesh
    Question 1. If confirmed, what steps will you take, as Chair of the 
NIGC, to combat human trafficking? What do you see as NIGC's role in 
anti-trafficking efforts?
    Answer. Preventing human trafficking and violence against women is 
a responsibility that I take very seriously, and I have worked on these 
issues throughout my career.
    The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act requires the NIGC to refer 
criminal matters to the appropriate law enforcement agency. It is also 
the NIGC's oversight responsibility to ensure that Tribes protect the 
public health and safety in Indian gaming premises, including from the 
threat of human trafficking. If confirmed as Chair of the NIGC, one of 
my top priorities will be continuing the NIGC's efforts to combat human 
trafficking in Indian gaming facilities. Within NIGC's authority, I 
would promote best practices to help Tribes address these issues at the 
local level and ensure that any criminal activity is reported to the 
appropriate law enforcement authorities as required by law. Also, as I 
touched on in the hearing, I believe it is important to utilize data to 
better understand the intersection between human trafficking and the 
gaming industry and to identify any potential data gaps. If confirmed 
as Chair of the NIGC, I commit to learning more about what data are 
available and working with you and members of this Committee, as well 
as with Tribes and other stakeholders, to combat human trafficking.

    Question 2. If confirmed, will you commit to review the NIGC 
internal ethics policies for Commissioners and employees and provide 
your views to the Committee on whether these ethics policies are 
adequate or need revision? I am particularly interested in your views 
as to whether these ethics policies are adequate with respect to 
conflicts of interest, any applicable ``cooling off'' periods on post-
government service employment, and any postemployment restrictions with 
private employers that may have business before the NIGC or financial 
interests in Indian gaming?
    Answer. Professional responsibility and accountability are 
foundational to my career. If confirmed as Chair of the NIGC, I commit 
to consulting with career ethics officials within the Department and 
adhering to the Department's high ethical standards. If confirmed, I 
will look into the issues that you have raised regarding internal 
ethics policies. I will also maintain open communication with you on 
this issue.
