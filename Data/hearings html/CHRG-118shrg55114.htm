        OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JON TESTER, CHAIRMAN,
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA

    Chairman Tester. I want to call this hearing to order. Good 
afternoon. Welcome to this hearing on whether Vet Centers are 
meeting the mark in addressing our veterans need, particularly 
in the areas of mental health, and not only our veterans, but 
also their families.
    Vet Centers were established in recognition that many 
Vietnam era veterans were experiencing readjustment challenges, 
and those various same veterans were wary of, or geographically 
far from VA medical centers. As a result, the Vet Center offers 
veterans the option to receive confidential mental healthcare 
services separate from those in the VHA facilities.
    They are community-based and offer a range of mental health 
services to eligible servicemembers, vets, their loved ones who 
experience military related trauma. They also support a 
successful transition to military life by offering marriage and 
family counseling, and serving as a resource for other VA 
benefits and services.
    Due to the recent efforts of this Committee, more veterans 
are eligible for services at the Vet Centers than ever before. 
And that's why it's critically important that the Vet Center 
program is delivering high quality services to the veterans who 
utilize it. Representatives from the VA, the Office of 
Inspector General, and the Government Accountability Office are 
here today to help us better understand improvements that could 
be made to the program so it meets the needs of all of our 
veterans.
    For example, the OIG has indicated that the Vet Center 
Inspection Program looking into clinical administrative 
processes associated with promoting quality care, patterns have 
already emerged in the first nine inspections, covering 36 Vet 
Centers. I've said it many times before, if there's a problem 
at one facility, there's likely to be problems at others. And I 
hope this hearing helps us better understand how the Vet Center 
Program is addressing the OIGs findings from a system-wide 
view.
    To meet increased Vet Center demand, Congress has taken 
recent action through the Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans 
Mental Health Care Improvement Act, to the STRONG Veterans Act 
to expand our Veterans Center's workforce. Given VA's 
announcement on Friday about meeting its staffing goals which 
is good news, I do want to hear from Mr. Fisher about whether 
this policy shift affects VA Center hiring.
    In addition, other initiatives such as a pilot program to 
provide childcare for those seeking face-to-face counseling at 
Vet Centers, and essentially updates to existing program to 
reduced transportation costs for veterans accessing in-person 
care have been too slow to get off the ground. These programs 
would help encourage veterans to utilize the important mental 
health services VA centers offer and need to be a focus of the 
department and the Vet Center program.
    On a recent visit to Missoula Vet Center, my staff was made 
aware that the Montana Department of Veterans Affairs and the 
University of Montana both use the Vet Center to connect with 
veterans and to operate a veteran's legal clinic, which help 
veterans with discharge upgrades, claims, appeals, wills, and 
civil legal issues. This is a great example of how VA can 
partner with local stakeholders to expand services at the Vet 
Center and get more veterans coming through their doors. This 
is especially important in rural areas where Vet Centers are 
critical mental health access points for our veterans.
    So I'm looking forward to our witnesses, share with us 
what's still lacking in the Vet Center Program and how we can 
work with the VA to make it better. With that, I turn it over 
to Senator Cassidy for his remarks.

                       HON. BILL CASSIDY,
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM LOUISIANA

    Senator Cassidy. Thank you, Chair Tester, and thanks to our 
witnesses for being here to discuss Vet Centers. Veterans' 
mental health and suicide prevention should be all of our top 
priority. In addition to Vet Centers, access to comprehensive 
mental health care and upstream crisis prevention are important 
factors in the holistic system of services available to 
veterans.
    I was pleased to see the VA recently announced that it'll 
award another $50 million to community organizations to help 
prevent veteran suicide, under the Staff Sergeant Parker Gordon 
Fox Grant program, part of the Commander John Scott Hannon's 
Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act. You know, you'll 
sometimes meet the spouse of a vet and he or she will say, 
typically it's she, ``I don't know where to go. I know there's 
a problem, but I'm not sure what to do.''
    Well, the Vet Centers are obviously a place, that's where 
you can go and if there's a gap between the veteran and the 
services and their families and the mental health and the 
readjustment, and you name it, that's what the Vet Center is 
there to do.
    In the past year, nearly 250,000 veterans, servicemembers, 
and their families, were able to receive counseling at one of 
these 300 Vet Centers. Veterans like them. Vet Centers score 
high on the trust and satisfaction surveys, and Vet Centers 
continually succeed in building access to social and 
psychological services in rural areas, that are more difficult 
for a veteran to find services otherwise.
    According to the written testimony from the GAO and the 
Office of Inspector General, there are challenges, though, at 
the Vet Center. Among these are outreach, staffing, 
recruitment. I'm also interested in learning how the Vet 
Centers interact with the rest of the VHA, where I have a 
higher level of concern about the effectiveness of the VA 
supporting veterans' mental health needs.
    I'm going to soon introduce, it's really hard even on an 
oversight committee to kind of know these questions. Thank you 
again for being here, but I'm going to introduce legislation 
soon called VetPAC, patterned after MedPAC and MACPAC, and 
VetPAC we hope will allow not just this oversight committee, 
but others to understand these interactions, these workings in 
a way that will help Congress better address issues like mental 
health and suicide prevention.
    This will help us work with individuals like our witnesses 
in front of us today to address these important priorities. 
Veterans in Louisiana and across the country, along with their 
family members and caregivers, rely, depend, expect, high 
quality care to be provided by the VA and Vet Centers. I'm 
committed to working with the department on finding solutions 
that help the facilities and the facility staff handle sudden 
influxes of vets and their family members, while making sure 
that all veterans nationwide receive the care they deserve. 
With that, I look forward to today's testimony, and I yield.
    Chairman Tester. Thank you, Dr. Cassidy. I appreciate you 
being here. I appreciate you filling in for Senator Moran\*\ 
this afternoon. I'd like to invite our witnesses to the 
afternoon's hearing. First up is going to be Michael Fisher, 
who is chief officer of the Readjustment Counseling Service at 
the Department of Veterans Affairs. Thank you for being here, 
Michael.

    \*\ An opening statement for Senator Moran appears on page 33 of 
the Appendix.

    Next, we have Dr. Julie Kroviak, who is the principal 
deputy assistant inspector general at the Office of Healthcare 
Inspections for the VA Office of Inspector General. Thank you 
for being here, Doctor.
    And finally, we've got Sharon Silas, director of healthcare 
team at the Government Accountability Office. And thank you for 
being here, Sharon. You each have 5 minutes. I would ask you to 
try to keep it that 5 minutes knowing that your entire written 
proposal here will be put in the minutes and we'll start with 
you--we'll go in the same order that I introduced you. So, 
Michael, you're up.

     STATEMENT OF MICHAEL FISHER, MSW, CHIEF OFFICER, RE-
       ADJUSTMENT  COUNSELING  SERVICE,  VETERANS  HEALTH 
       ADMINISTRATION,  DEPARTMENT  OF  VETERANS  AFFAIRS

    Mr. Fisher. Thank you, and good afternoon, Chairman Tester, 
Senator Cassidy, and Members of the Committee. I appreciate the 
opportunity to join you today to discuss the services available 
at Readjustment Counseling Services or RCS Vet Centers. Vet 
Centers are a central component of the VHA comprehensive 
service delivery system, serving a distinct role and 
facilitating easy access to readjustment counseling, to 
eligible veterans, servicemembers and their families.
    They also help overcome barriers to other resources within 
VA and local communities. These centers offer non-medical 
counseling to individuals who have served in combat operations, 
areas of hostility, stateside deployments, or have endured 
other military service-related trauma. They also cater to those 
receiving VA educational benefits. The culture and environment 
of Vet Centers, along with the military and trauma-informed 
training and experience of our staff, creates a supportive 
community that is non-stigmatizing, builds trust and 
effectively addresses the needs of our clients.
    Vet Centers are legally separate from VA's general 
healthcare facilities and adhere to strict confidentiality 
practices. Although they operate independently from other 
places in VHA, there is a bi-directional referral and care 
coordination system in place to ensure seamless connectivity.
    The Vet Center model has significant impact on clients' 
well-being, and according to over 72,000 customer feedback 
responses, more than 93 percent of clients trust Vet Centers to 
improve the quality of their life, and over 95 percent of both 
new and established clients reported an ability to schedule 
appointments within a reasonable time. Clients share heartfelt 
testimonies emphasizing the compassionate care they receive and 
positive impact on their lives.
    One example is an OEF veteran who walked into a California 
Vet Center in crisis in 2019. This former paratrooper was not 
sleeping or getting along with his family. He barely found 
motivation to get out of bed and was experiencing suicide 
ideation. One counselor, or our counselor, who is also a 
veteran, met with him on the spot and handled the crisis. 
Further counseling sessions led to identifying personal goals 
to address anger, guilt, shame, and intrusive memories.
    Our team supported with consistent individual and marriage 
counseling, and he was also able to create a renewed sense of 
comradery, through connecting with other veterans in a trauma 
writing group. As a veteran community, they processed their 
experiences and began to heal. Following this journey, he has a 
better relationship with his spouse, a new outlook as a father, 
earned his PhD in history, where he now works as a professor, 
and advocates for others to seek support at Vet Centers.
    Recently enacted legislation, expanded services to new 
cohorts and strengthened our workforce. The STRONG Veterans Act 
of 2022 expanded Vet Center eligibility to veterans and 
servicemembers utilizing qualified education benefits and to 
families of veterans and servicemembers who lost a loved one to 
suicide. To date, approximately 250 student beneficiaries and 
180 family members have benefited from these services.
    Further, RCS has hired an additional 50 counselors, 48 of 
whom are on board. Other legislation established the Vet Center 
Scholarship program for individuals pursuing advanced mental 
health related degrees, who will then work at a Vet Center. VA 
has awarded 46 scholarships with priority given to veterans, 
and more awards are anticipated as the application process 
continues.
    Finally, RCS is partnering with other VA offices to 
establish new pilot programs that will benefit and improve 
access to individuals we serve to include a pilot to reimburse 
travel costs for those experiencing financial difficulties in 
rural and tribal communities, a pilot to provide grants to 
address food insecurity among veterans and their families, and 
a pilot to expand the VetSuccess on Campus program to 
additional tribal colleges and universities.
    Chairman Tester, Senator Cassidy, we would like to express 
our gratitude for the opportunity to discuss these crucial 
issues. We value our ongoing partnership and as we collectively 
fulfill our responsibility to serve the Nation's veterans, 
servicemembers, and their families. Thank you, and I look 
forward to your questions.

    [The prepared statement of Mr. Fisher appears on page 39 of 
the Appendix.]

    Chairman Tester. Michael, thank you for your testimony. And 
there will be questions, I guarantee it. Dr. Kroviak.

    STATEMENT OF JULIE KROVIAK, MD, PRINCIPAL DEPUTY AS-
      SISTANT  INSPECTOR GENERAL,  OFFICE OF  HEALTHCARE 
      INSPECTIONS, OFFICE  OF INSPECTOR GENERAL, DEPART-
      MENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

    Dr. Kroviak. Chairman Tester, Senator Cassidy, Senator 
Tuberville, thank you for the opportunity to discuss the OIGs 
Vet Center Inspection program known as VCIP. These cyclical 
inspections are designed to help VA Vet Center counselors 
provide services that are safe and effective in meeting the 
needs of their clients.
    While we recognize the wide array of services provided to 
veterans, servicemembers, and their families at these centers, 
we pay particular attention to policies and procedures that 
identify and support those veterans deemed high risk for 
suicide. Our oversight work is designed to support and 
strengthen VHA's important partnership with Vet Centers in 
reducing veteran suicide.
    Independent oversight provides an objective analysis of 
leaders and frontline staff adherence to VHA policy and their 
performance in meeting their mission. Three years into VCIP 
implementation, we have published reports covering all five 
districts and nine zones in the Vet Center system. This week, 
our teams are in Hawaii, Alaska, Arizona, Oregon, California, 
and Washington, conducting inspections.
    While we are often encouraged by the dedication of Vet 
Center staff during these site visits, we repeatedly find 
evidence of non-compliance with many required processes, most 
notably those for assessing and documenting a veteran's suicide 
risk. Further, our teams are finding repeated failures in 
internal oversight of staff training and supervision. These 
deficiencies can have severe consequences.
    Identifying the deficiencies was an important step, but now 
with multiple inspections completed, we better understand the 
factors that contribute to them. The first is a lack of clear 
and standardized policies necessary to support frontline staff 
in providing high quality services to clients. We have 
repeatedly found instances where Vet Center staff report 
confusion, conflicting policy language, or unnecessarily 
cumbersome processes to conduct basic tasks in support of their 
clients.
    Tools such as a SharePoint site that identifies clients as 
high risk for suicide are neither effectively nor consistently 
utilized, as many staff report, they were never informed on the 
purpose, they're perplexed by the inefficiencies and multiple 
steps to enter basic information, and repeatedly misinformed by 
the site's inaccurate information.
    Second, workload and staffing challenges are repeated 
concerns in most of the Vet Centers we have visited. During 
interviews we frequently meet with leaders in acting positions 
or leaders assuming multiple roles to compensate for vacancies, 
which are in part due to the inability to compete with the 
clinical salaries offered by VA medical centers. This leads to 
client workload some counselors have described as 
unsustainable.
    Finally, a modern and efficient electronic recordkeeping 
system is critical to ensure that required collaboration, 
coordination, and quality oversight activities not only occur 
timely, but also meet quality standards. Staff have repeatedly 
shared their concerns and frustrations with the limited 
functionality of the current RCS net system. With the Oracle 
Health EHRM implementation in a reset phase, when and whether 
Vet Centers will have the opportunity to modernize their system 
remains unclear.
    Just like in VHA clinical facilities, strong Vet Center 
leadership must set the tone for a culture that supports the 
safety and quality of services for everyone receiving care. A 
recent report at the South Bend Indiana Vet Center, highlighted 
leadership failures that jeopardized the care of several 
clients deemed to be high risk for suicide. The Vet Center 
director informally encouraged staff to underrate clients' 
suicide risks, failed to evaluate staff's completion of safety 
plans and clinical coordination, and failed to train staff on 
assessing and managing clients' risks of suicide.
    Considering that Vet Centers can be the first door a 
veteran in crisis opens to engage in care, there is no room for 
careless and incompetent leadership. The OIG will continue our 
cyclical reviews of Vet Centers, building on the lessons 
learned in earlier reviews, and increasing our focus on 
leaders' oversight of quality operations. We have expanded our 
review of Vet Center outreach activities, including Mobile Vet 
Centers, as engaging those veterans living in underserved and 
more remote areas is critical to getting needed care to those 
at risk for suicide.
    Similar to our recommendation to VHA medical facilities, 
clear policies and vigilant internal oversight must be 
structured and standardized, and leadership must hold 
themselves and their staff accountable to safe, high quality 
practices. Chairman Tester and Committee members, this 
concludes my statement and I'd be happy to take any questions 
you may have.

    [The prepared statement of Dr. Kroviak appears on page 50

    Chairman Tester. Thank you, Doctor. And there will be some. 
Sharon, you're up.

     STATEMENT OF SHARON M. SILAS, DIRECTOR, HEALTH CARE, 
              GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE

    Ms. Silas. Chairman Tester, Senator Cassidy, and Senator 
Tuberville, thank you for the opportunity to be here today to 
discuss GAO's work on VA's Vet Centers. Vet Centers provide a 
non-institutional access point to receive VA mental health 
care. They are community-based and offer a range of mental 
health services in a variety of settings. Vet Centers may 
appeal to certain veteran populations who are reluctant to 
receive mental health services through a VA medical center and 
can provide flexibilities that may appeal to certain veterans 
and military servicemembers and their families.
    In fiscal year 2023, over 300 Vet Centers located across 
the United States provided counseling services to over 104,000 
clients. However, successfully meeting the potential of Vet 
Centers requires ensuring they're effectively meeting their 
client's needs, outreaching to potential populations who could 
benefit from its services, and addressing barriers to care. My 
testimony today is based on a report GAO issued in May 2022, 
which can provide some insights into VA's Vet Center efforts.
    First, in our review, we found that while Vet Centers have 
tools to assess whether individual veterans' needs were being 
met throughout the course of treatment, there was not an 
assessment of whether veterans' needs were being met 
collectively. That is, by subpopulations that might face 
different challenges readjusting to civilian life. We found 
that the RCS had not analyzed information from assessments or 
surveys to assess what proportion of Vet Center clients were 
making progress overall.
    For example, Vietnam veterans may have different needs than 
those who served in more recent conflicts, such as Iraq or 
Afghanistan. Having information across Vet Centers and 
assessment of differences across different subpopulations, 
could help RCS better understand and inform Vet Center efforts 
and help identify a need for additional services. In our 
report, we made a recommendation to address this finding, which 
RCS addressed last spring, and it is now closed as implemented.
    Second, we found that Vet Centers lack data that would help 
better tailor their outreach activities and guidance on how to 
assess the effectiveness of these efforts. Vet Centers are 
required to develop annual outreach plans tailored to their 
service area population, and engage with community stakeholders 
to reach veterans. To do this, Vet Centers use some data to 
tailor outreach activities such as census data.
    However, as we discuss in our report, having data that 
would allow Vet Centers to better identify certain populations 
such as transitioning servicemembers, could help Vet Centers be 
more effective in their outreach efforts. We also found Vet 
Centers were tracking outreach efforts and collecting data on 
their contacts with veterans. However, we found that Vet 
Centers could benefit from guidance that include metrics and 
targets for assessing the effectiveness of these outreach 
activities.
    Lastly, RCS identified some barriers to Vet Center care and 
actions and had taken steps to address those barriers. 
Specifically, RCS identified barriers to veterans obtaining Vet 
Center services. For example, some veterans may lack awareness 
of Vet Centers and the services they offer or experience 
challenges accessing a Vet Center due to a lack of 
transportation.
    RCS had taken steps to address these barriers, such as 
coordinating with DoD and the National Guard to increase the 
awareness of Vet Center services and providing the option to 
receive mental health services via telehealth. RCS also 
identified a barrier to Vet Centers providing services. 
Specifically, Vet Centers counselors are required to receive 
monthly clinical consults with VA medical center mental health 
staff on complex cases.
    We learned that Vet Center counselors do not always get the 
required 4 hours a month because of the availability of VA 
Medical Center staff to provide those consults. RCS told us 
that these issues typically get raised at the annual site 
visits to Vet Centers, and that a VA medical staff are not 
available, district mental health staff can fill in. Although 
RCS had taken steps to address these issues, it had not 
determined the extent to which their actions had minimized the 
barriers.
    Based on the findings for our review, we made five 
recommendations, four of them remain open. RCS has taken steps 
to address these four recommendations, including working with 
VA Office of Information Technology to develop a new software 
system and piloting a new measurement process to more 
effectively measure Vet Centers outreach efforts.
    In closing, Vet Centers can be a powerful tool for VA and 
play a pivotal role in successfully reaching and delivering 
quality mental health care to veterans and servicemembers and 
their families as they adjust to civilian life. RCS and Vet 
Centers have taken steps to reach out to potential clients, 
meet clients' needs, and identify any barriers to access. Fully 
addressing our recommendations will help RCS and Vet Centers to 
increase the effectiveness of these efforts. This concludes my 
prepared statement. I'm happy to take any questions you have.

    [The prepared statement of Ms. Silas appears on page 59 of 
the Appendix.]

    Chairman Tester. Well, thank you for that statement, 
Sharon, and I appreciate all of your statements. I'm going to 
start with you Mr. Fisher. We learned late last week from the 
VA that it has exceeded its healthcare hiring goals, but will 
continue to focus hiring on mental health care and concentrate 
on parts of the country where demand continues to grow. So the 
question is, will this continued hiring focus on mental health 
care also extend to Vet Centers?
    Mr. Fisher. Thank you for the question, Senator. And yes, 
it will. There----
    Chairman Tester. But keep going if you want. That's the 
answer I wanted to hear.
    Mr. Fisher. Yes, it will.
    Chairman Tester. Okay. So I want to go over to Dr. 
Kroviak's statement. In her document, her testimony, it says, 
``Through interviews and surveys of RCS staff, the OIG garnered 
consistent reports that non-competitive salaries of Vet Center 
positions with low grade levels on the general salary pay 
schedule contribute to vacancies.'' I couldn't find it here 
where you said that there are a lot of vacancies in our Vet 
Centers. In your research, did you find a lot of open 
positions?
    Dr. Kroviak. So these are interviews we have with 
leadership when we go on-site where it is more than anecdotal 
that they are complaining of staffing shortages and----
    Chairman Tester. Got you.
    Dr. Kroviak [continuing]. Increasing workloads.
    Chairman Tester. By the way, we all on this Committee value 
the work that both the IG and the GAO does. So I want to thank 
you for that. They also found that a lot of the positions were 
in acting positions, which further contributes to not being 
able to hire people, because unless you're in a full-time 
position, that becomes a problem.
    So, for you Mr. Fisher, Michael, what are you as the head 
of the Vet Centers doing, number one. And number two, does the 
secretary know about this? Do the folks up the chain know about 
this, and are they going to address it moving forward?
    Mr. Fisher. Yes, sir. So there's a couple of things that we 
are doing. The first thing that we are doing is that we've done 
this past year a full review of all position descriptions and 
functional statements within our organization to make sure that 
they are appropriately graded, given our peers within other 
places in VA medical centers that those documents are going 
through the final concurrence process, and we are starting 
implementation planning to include union notification for 
rollout.
    Second thing that we are doing is working to improve our 
time to fill. Last year was 154 days. Fiscal year to date, we 
are at 104 days, and looking for efficiencies and being able to 
bring people on faster.
    Chairman Tester. But if in fact our salaries are 
substandard, you're going to have a hard time getting anybody, 
much less good people to go to work for you. Would you agree 
with that?
    Mr. Fisher. I would agree with that.
    Chairman Tester. And hopefully, somebody is addressing 
that. If it's not----
    Mr. Fisher. We are. We are addressing.
    Chairman Tester. Good. Good. So one of the things that has 
always appealed to me about Vet Centers is the same thing that 
appeals to me about taking somebody that has PTSD and putting 
them on a river fishing or riding a horse or doing yoga or any 
of that stuff. Is that, it's more laid back. It's much less 
structured, much more welcoming, and to be honest with you, 
from my perspective when I've been in the stress level is zero. 
I mean, it's just, things are cool. Okay?
    So, number one, do you see that as being a priority for Vet 
Centers, and do you encourage that kind of less structured 
atmosphere where people can let their hair down and talk to 
other veterans about stuff?
    Mr. Fisher. So yes, we do encourage that. And I think 
that's at the heart of what Vet Centers are. A nonbureaucratic, 
no wrong door, come in to begin that journey to set goals.
    Chairman Tester. Okay. And are you seeing overall--and this 
is a tough question, because we've established a lot of Vet 
Centers that weren't around 5 years ago or a lot more than 10 
years ago. Are you seeing use by the veterans increasing?
    Mr. Fisher. We are seeing increasing usage in certain 
areas.
    Chairman Tester. What areas are you talking about? Talk to 
me. What areas are you seeing the increase?
    Mr. Fisher. We're seeing areas increasing in the south.
    Chairman Tester. Oh, Okay. You're talking about regions. I 
thought you were talking about health issues.
    Mr. Fisher. Regions, excuse me.
    Chairman Tester. Okay. And then the last question is, what 
kind of use are you seeing from the physically disabled 
veterans' groups?
    Mr. Fisher. That is data that we don't have. And that's 
something that we can take back for the record and be able to 
answer that more effectively.
    Chairman Tester. That'd be good. I'm just curious, you 
know. Dr. Cassidy.
    Senator Cassidy. Thank you. Obviously as we all know, 
there's been an issue at the VA in which a person at suicide 
risk was counseled by their supervisor to frankly lie about the 
incident. And so it comes to mind, Dr. Kroviak, because in your 
testimony we'll get it quite right, but you said someone was 
encouraged to understate the risk for suicide and then you 
speak of perilous and incompetent leadership remaining in 
place.
    Dr. Kroviak. So it was actually the Vet Center director at 
the time that was encouraging staff to underrate the client's 
suicide risk.
    Senator Cassidy. Okay. Did that Vet Center supervisor stay 
in place?
    Dr. Kroviak. No.
    Senator Cassidy. They're gone?
    Dr. Kroviak. Correct.
    Senator Cassidy. That's a good thing.
    Dr. Kroviak. Yes.
    Senator Cassidy. Great. Next you had mentioned the problems 
with the EHR. How well is somebody who is at risk for suicide 
integrated into the VA health system? In the sense that, do 
they get, ``Don't stop, don't--boom, go. You're going to the ER 
right now, you're going to be in the ER, and you're going to be 
evaluated and you're going to--they're going to check you 
out.'' How well is that integration between those two entities?
    Dr. Kroviak. So there's no integration between the systems.
    Senator Cassidy. No, we're both docs. The integration may 
not be formal, but the integration may be, ``Hey, Sam, I got 
you to take this patient right now.''
    Dr. Kroviak. Correct. So there are requirements for 
coordination based on an assessment done within the Vet Center. 
And much of our work is showing there are inconsistencies or 
underperformance in meeting the requirements to ensure that 
veterans who are rated as intermediate or high risk are getting 
the type of coordination with the clinical or medical side of 
VHA that they need.
    Senator Cassidy. Okay. How pervasive, do you have a sense 
of how pervasive that is?
    Dr. Kroviak. It is quite pervasive. We've published nine 
reports. We have been to 36 Vet Centers, and it's a repeated 
finding.
    Senator Cassidy. Mr. Fisher, how would you respond to that? 
If this has been going on for some time, it's not brand new, 
it's pervasive, but not being fixed apparently.
    Mr. Fisher. Last year we recognized that this was an 
enterprise challenge, and we went in and did some process 
improvements at the national level to ensure that those 
individuals who come into a Vet Center are getting those risk 
assessments and documenting those risk assessments in that 
first session. Now, if at the outcome of those risk assessments 
it's determined that they need a higher level of care, our 
staff are making those connections.
    Senator Cassidy. Now, I'm hearing though they're not making 
the connections. I gather on paper they're supposed to, but Dr. 
Kroviak and the IG has looked at it and said they're not making 
them. Do you dispute those findings?
    Mr. Fisher. What my concern is that I don't know if we are 
documenting those results correctly.
    Senator Cassidy. Dr. Kroviak?
    Dr. Kroviak. So that may very well be true. The ability to 
document and timestamp application of these processes is quite 
limited in RCS net. But we've also noticed that there are 
issues with even ensuring that staff are properly trained to 
conduct the assessments and screenings. So it is a training and 
oversight problem as well.
    Senator Cassidy. And again, the training issue is pervasive 
as well.
    Dr. Kroviak. Correct.
    Senator Cassidy. Mr. Fisher, I mean, we're talking suicide, 
you see what I'm saying? So is there a stepwise plan that you 
could send the two of us and we could look at it and we say, 
``Oh, this is reasonable. They're addressing it.'' And we could 
actually go someplace and see it being implemented, and we say 
it's actually being implemented. Because I'm hearing from Dr. 
Kroviak that that's not the case. She didn't say it precisely, 
but implicit in what she's saying is that it's not happening.
    Mr. Fisher. Yes, sir. There is a plan in place and in 
locations that that finding happens. That district office 
creates an action plan to improve those concerns, and we can 
provide that.
    Senator Cassidy. Okay. And Dr. Kroviak, I don't want to 
keep on putting you on the spot, but I've learned, I practiced 
medicine for a long time in institutions that sometimes were 
not good, even though they have motivated people. An action 
plan does not necessarily create results. Have you seen the 
institutions in which these action plans have been implemented 
and have you seen whether or not they have been actually 
effective?
    Dr. Kroviak. So we don't close the recommendations until we 
actually review the action plan and accept the action plan as 
reasonable, and accept data that suggests not only is it 
working, but it's a sustainable improvement place. So for those 
recommendations that have been closed, you can be assured that 
we went through that rigorous process before we closed them.
    Senator Cassidy. Implicitly though, that if they are still 
open, it means that you've not yet seen that.
    Dr. Kroviak. Correct.
    Senator Cassidy. That's important, Mr. Fisher.
    Mr. Fisher. Agreed.
    Senator Cassidy. I yield.
    Chairman Tester. Thank you, Senator Cassidy. Senator 
Blumenthal.

                    HON. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL,
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM CONNECTICUT

    Senator Blumenthal. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I want to ask 
about a topic that, or an issue that may seem kind of 
elementary. Why are the Vet Centers operated separately from 
the VA healthcare system?
    Mr. Fisher. That goes back to our founding in 1979 as being 
a safe place for the Vietnam combat veteran to come in and to 
begin to access services. Now, when that individual or those 
individuals were comfortable, our focus is to create care 
coordination referral to other benefits and resources. So, our 
partnership with our local medical centers is about bi-
directional referral and care coordination.
    Senator Blumenthal. But why should the records be 
completely separate? Why isn't there some integration or joint 
recordkeeping?
    Mr. Fisher. That goes back to another founding principle of 
making sure that the veteran or servicemember is in the 
driver's seat of their care and they make decisions about who 
they want their care team to be. Now, if the veteran or 
servicemember says, ``I want my medical center care team to be 
a part of that,'' then we begin those conversations. We release 
records, and we also release information if they're to avert 
crisis.
    Senator Blumenthal. Is that something the Inspector General 
has an opinion on?
    Dr. Kroviak. So we very much respect the origins of the Vet 
Center program, and it really was founded on the spirit of a 
separation between VA and unfortunately a lot of mistrust on 
the part of veterans back during the time when it was founded. 
So we don't take issue with the fact that there's a separate 
record, but we take issue with is, especially focusing on 
reducing veteran suicide, is when that required coordination 
doesn't take place regardless of the records communicating with 
each other.
    Senator Blumenthal. Well, it seems to me that more than 
suicide ought to be involved, healthcare generally ought to be 
integrated. You know, the whole principle. I understand the 
mistrust at the time of Vietnam.
    Dr. Kroviak. Sure.
    Senator Blumenthal. But the VA healthcare system has come a 
long way since then, or it should come a long way. And rather 
than kind of accepting the mistrust as a given, shouldn't we 
overcome it because the VA healthcare system has the 
psychiatric and the counseling and other services that are 
necessary?
    Dr. Kroviak. Certainly. I just want to be careful to say 
that there are not--these are not clinical or medical services 
provided in Vet Centers. So the distinction should be made that 
it's not that a lack of clinical information is separated by 
the record separation, but I appreciate what you're saying with 
how the ease of connecting the two could be appropriate and 
important for many veterans.
    Senator Blumenthal. Let me ask you. You know, we have an 
investigation going in the Permanent Subcommittee on 
Investigation, which is a part of the Homeland Security 
Committee. Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation is looking 
into a program called Operation Fouled Anchor, which was an 
investigation itself within the Coast Guard of sexual assault.
    Operation Fouled Anchor was covered up sexual assaults. 
Many of them were never properly investigated or pursued. And 
many of those survivors left the Academy, Coast Guard Academy. 
Are they able to access services through the Vet Centers and 
through your program?
    Mr. Fisher. Yes. Individuals who experience a military 
sexual trauma while serving can come into Vet Centers and also 
enjoy that confidentiality, because they might not yet be ready 
to have those conversations.
    One other thing Senator, if I can bring back up to our 
separate record system. Not every individual that comes into a 
Vet Center is eligible for the larger VHA healthcare or ready 
to make that step. And I think about law enforcement or other 
individuals who don't have that comfort level yet. Our focus 
through the informed consent process to help them get there and 
then make--you know, allow them to make decisions.
    Senator Blumenthal. But let me just ask about someone who 
is a survivor or victim of sexual assault while going to one of 
our academies, whether it's West Point or Naval Academy or a 
Coast Guard, or in training somewhere. They haven't been in 
combat. They haven't actually maybe been formally commissioned. 
They leave while they're still there. They haven't graduated. 
Can they get care for the sexual assault that they've suffered 
and the trauma?
    Mr. Fisher. My understanding is that that individual at 
that point is a member of the military, which would then be 
eligible for those kind of services at Vet Centers. But I would 
like to take that back and just make sure I'm giving you 
accurate information.
    Senator Blumenthal. I appreciate that. Thanks, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Chairman Tester. Senator Tuberville.

                     HON. TOMMY TUBERVILLE,
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM ALABAMA

    Senator Tuberville. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for 
what you guys do. What a tough job with all the vets we have 
and all the wars we've had and look like we're going to have. 
Ms. Silas, we're not going to leave you out here. I'm going to 
ask you my first question.
    The GAO report referenced in your testimony describes many 
issues related to the lack of effective promotion of Vet 
Centers, specifically ensuring Vet Centers have data on 
eligible individuals in their service areas to whom they could 
reach out. Your report points out that Vet Centers may be able 
to obtain some data on veterans in their service area, but it 
is not tailored enough for Vet Centers to conduct effective 
overreach or outreach. What progress has the GAO identified, 
you know, this situation?
    Ms. Silas. Thank you for that question.
    Senator Tuberville. I didn't want you to go to sleep.
    [Laughter.]
    Ms. Silas. Yes. So what we found was that Vet Centers were 
primarily using census data to try to tailor their outreach 
efforts. And the census data really only goes down to county 
level and it doesn't have some of the specific information that 
would help them be able to target specific veteran populations. 
And so we made a recommendation for RCS to have some more 
robust data for the Vet Centers to tap into.
    And so RCS is now developing a software solution for Vet 
Centers, which would provide Vet Centers with access to a VA, 
DoD software, or a data system that has information on 
transitioning servicemembers. And it also goes down to the zip 
code level, so it gets more granular, and then it has more of 
the demographic information that will help them better identify 
veterans to outreach to.
    Senator Tuberville. So is that software, is it active as we 
speak? Is it working?
    Ms. Silas. My understanding, it's still developing. I'm 
going to defer to Mr. Fisher.
    Mr. Fisher. You are correct. We are still developing and we 
will be rolling out that this fiscal year after we go through 
union notification. That will give us access to transitioning 
servicemembers so we can reach out to them. We also have a 
projection model that allows us to go and get understanding of 
the counseling needs in local communities, given our unique 
eligibility, which can also help our outreach staff to go and 
determine where to do targeted outreach.
    Senator Tuberville. Yes. It's about people, right? It's 
about having good people, especially doing your job. Mr. 
Fisher, what happens when an individual comes to a Vet Center 
seeking counseling, but it is evident to the counselor that the 
individual is in crisis, perhaps on the verge of hurting 
themselves or someone else. What happens next?
    Mr. Fisher. It is all about getting that individual to the 
level of care that they need.
    Senator Tuberville. Immediately?
    Mr. Fisher. Immediately. That could be to our VA medical 
center peers. It could also be through the local community 
healthcare systems, 911.
    Senator Tuberville. Is there any follow up from the 
processing center following that individual to the VA?
    Mr. Fisher. There is follow up. In fact, we have examples 
of where staff then accompany that veteran to that higher level 
of care.
    Senator Tuberville. Okay. How do vets and the larger 
Veterans Health Administration interact with each other when it 
comes to technology, information data? Do you all interact 
pretty well from the processing centers to the VAs?
    Mr. Fisher. When it comes to us with our peers at VA 
medical centers, we have that bi-directional referral where, 
you know, I think about it, if you walk into a Vet Center with 
a broken foot, we've got to get you over to the place to fix 
that. And that is our focus, is on warm handoffs. Now, I think 
we have locations and communities that we need to do a better 
job and work on that relationship, that back and forth.
    Senator Tuberville. I had a buddy of mine about 4 years 
ago, mental health, bad Navy SEAL. He had seen and done things 
probably none of us would ever imagine. Had huge problems, but 
had a tough time getting past the front door at some of our 
VAs. You know, and again, it's about people, you know, actually 
security had to escort him out because when you get to that 
level, you know, it's pretty tough. You know, so again, it all 
goes back to people. I guess that's all I've got, Mr. Chairman. 
Thank you.
    Chairman Tester. You bet. Senator Sinema.

                      HON. KYRSTEN SINEMA,
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM ARIZONA

    Senator Sinema. Thank you, Chairman Tester, and thank you 
to Ranking Member Moran for holding this hearing today. Thank 
you to our witnesses for being here today. You know, Vet 
Centers provide a great resource that focus on the readjustment 
and mental health needs of our veterans and current 
servicemembers. In Arizona, where roughly 10 percent of our 
State's population is currently serving or has previously 
served as a member of our armed forces, the challenges facing 
veterans are varied.
    Based on concerns heard by my office, Vet Centers can be 
hard to access for those residing in Arizona's rural and tribal 
communities. And deficiencies in the client record system and 
staffing shortages have contributed to heavy workloads 
prescribed by RCS policies can make accessing mental health 
care even more difficult. Enhancing access to mental health 
care is crucial, especially in a confidential setting as 
provided at our Vet Centers.
    I understand that RCS and Vet Centers have implemented one 
of GAO's recommendations in its May 2022 report, and have taken 
some steps in implementing the other four recommendations. I 
encourage RCS and Vet Centers to continue this progress, 
especially working to minimize barriers to Vet Center care. 
That'll be the focus of my questions.
    So my first question is to you, Mr. Fisher. My office has 
been hearing from Arizona veterans and VA staff regarding 
concerns about unmanageable counselor's workloads, which leads 
to burnout, high turnover, and of course, impacts the quality 
of care that veterans are receiving. Is RCS still following the 
1.5 visits per hour policy? And how are Vet Centers managing 
the demand for mental health services while ensuring the 
quality of care is not impacted?
    Mr. Fisher. Sure. So thank you for the question, Senator. 
I'd like to address the 1.5. There is a formula that we use for 
what we consider a fully successful counselor. Really, we're 
asking our counselors to spend half their time doing 
counseling, outreach, and then associated travel.
    The other side of that, what I hear in your question, is 
workload. Veterans and servicemembers coming in in places where 
there are demand issues, meaning we have more individuals 
coming in or the amount of time we're spending in front of 
veterans is increasing. We look to recruit more staff. We also 
look to move some of that work through virtual services to 
other Vet Centers as a band aid while we bring in more staff 
where needed.
    The other side of that is our first line of defense, is our 
first level supervisors. That Vet Center director, who then 
takes those incoming needs and manages it within the various 
counselors, as well as requesting those additional resources.
    Senator Sinema. Does the VHA have plans to improve its 
recruitment and retention policy for quality counselors, 
including in rural and tribal areas?
    Mr. Fisher. We do have plans, and have implemented plans to 
ensure recruitment and retention, whether that is using special 
salary rates, the recruitment, retention relocation incentives, 
scholarships, loan repayments that we are actively using right 
now, to both hire and retain great staff.
    Senator Sinema. And with which incentive program have you 
seen the most success when you're onboarding quality Vet Center 
employees? And then how are Vet Centers supporting current 
staff to reduce attrition rates and help the staff manage the 
increasing demand for services?
    Mr. Fisher. We'll have to take it for the--we'd like to 
respectfully take it for the record on which of those 
incentives is working the best, and can--I'm sorry, ma'am, can 
you repeat your second part of your question?
    Senator Sinema. How are the Vet Centers currently 
supporting staff to try and reduce attrition rates and help 
them manage increased demand for services?
    Mr. Fisher. Yes. Well, we go back to we have processes in 
place where Vet Centers can ask for more resources. We also 
have the incentives that we've talked about to ensure retention 
as well as recruitment. And then also, our district offices 
have had conversations and are creating action planning with 
our Vet Centers around burnout, ideas of burnout that are not 
covered in workload and other things. It could very well be, 
staff might be interested in going to certain trainings. So we 
create those opportunities.
    Senator Sinema. So for both Mr. Fisher and Dr. Kroviak, the 
Tucson Vet Center recently shared concerns with my team about 
their electronic client record system, and how it's slowing 
down the delivery of provider care. The Vet Center staff 
reported the system is decades out-of-date, and contains 
redundant steps for documenting patient and family 
interactions. So could you talk to me about what the VA is 
doing to ensure that Vet Centers get more effective and up-to-
date IT systems for their clinical staff?
    Dr. Kroviak. So from an oversight perspective, everything 
you said is exactly what we're finding across the system. The 
inefficiencies are real. It is a primitive system. It doesn't 
support functions that you would assume it should in terms of 
collaboration, coordination, and oversight. Again, we don't 
understand where the Vet Centers fit into the modernization 
attempt, but they have made attempts to enhance the current 
program.
    An example would be a reminder that pops up when a suicide 
risk assessment is due. So, we think there can be or there is 
space to consider what enhancements can be made to the current 
program to ensure safety and certainly reduce some of the 
burdensome workloads through electronic efficiencies. Pardon 
me.
    Mr. Fisher. We have partnered with OIT as well as VHA to 
begin to review needs, what our needs are for a future record 
system, and then begin to implement those needs. We can provide 
updates as we go through that process.
    Senator Sinema. I appreciate that. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Chairman Tester. Thank you, Senator Sinema. Senator Tillis.

                       HON. THOM TILLIS,
                U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA

    Senator Tillis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you all 
for being here. Mr. Fisher, this should be just a nit. I 
wouldn't expect you to know this, but my staff had recently 
gone out to the VA website and then went into the Vet Center 
National Resource Directory, and the next level down you only 
find three sites. I think it's Raleigh, Greensboro, 
Fayetteville, and then you have to drill down further to find 
Jacksonville. It sounds like simple when you hit North 
Carolina, get all the locations, people I know, you know, 
regional areas well, but you may have other people looking for 
these resources to give it to them quickly. So that's just a 
software modification request. I'm sure your OIT people can 
take care of that.
    I also want to talk about the pilot related to outreach. I 
think you have a path forward there, from the GAO report they 
recommended that you're doing a pilot and tracking 
effectiveness of outreach. You know what I'm talking about?
    Mr. Fisher. Yes.
    Senator Tillis. Do you have a path forward? I don't think 
that it's materialized yet. Can you give me an idea of what 
the, you know, how many locations are going to be piloted at 
what sort of timeframe we can expect to be implemented?
    Mr. Fisher. Yes. We do expect to implement that in the 
coming months. As far as locations, we are going to negotiate 
with the union, and then we will have a set number of locations 
for that. But it is really focused on looking at the quality of 
outreach and specifically how many individuals are coming in 
from outreach into counseling services.
    Senator Tillis. Yes. So tell me a little bit more about 
that. I mean, how are you going to be able to measure it? Tell 
me a little bit about the pilot to where you're really able to 
connect specific activities to moving the needle in the right 
direction or not moving the needle, and therefore you have to 
look at a different alternative.
    Mr. Fisher. If we can respectfully take that for the record 
so we can give you a full outline of everything that we are 
doing.
    Senator Tillis. Good.
    Mr. Fisher. Also on your comment about the website, we have 
recently implemented websites for every Vet Center that 
includes up-to-date information on the type of services we 
provide at those locations. We will also take that other item 
back to look for some inefficiencies.
    Senator Tillis. Thank you. Just get the information as 
quick--if somebody's taken the initiative to find this service, 
you want to make it as easy as possible to get down to that 
brick and mortar location that----
    Mr. Fisher. Agreed.
    Senator Tillis [continuing]. They can go to. Ms. Kroviak, 
did I pronounce that right?
    Dr. Kroviak. You did.
    Senator Tillis. Tell me a little bit in the research--I 
guess, maybe let's look at it a different way. I got a few 
specific questions, time allowing, but if we've got veteran 
center directors listening to this hearing right now, what's 
the main takeaway from your perspective, from the office of OIG 
that they, they should take away?
    Dr. Kroviak. Read every report we publish, even if it's not 
about your Vet Center. These are risk assessment tools, and it 
should be spreading like wildfire across the system as to what 
they need to look at and what they need to fix, or at least 
assess whether or not they need to fix it.
    Senator Tillis. Do you know if the department--I think 
that's a great suggestion. It's only as good as the take rate 
for the suggestion to read it, internalize it, execute it. Do 
you feel that the department is doing enough to make sure that 
that's being communicated in the manner that you've just 
communicated it here?
    Dr. Kroviak. Honestly, no. I think we'd be seeing more 
improvements across the system if that was actually into 
practice as we would like it to be.
    Senator Tillis. Yes. Give me a silver lining if there is 
one. In your research, did you identify any particularly good, 
better, or best practices that should be emulated?
    Dr. Kroviak. Oh, it's communication. So within a Vet 
Center, if they have strong communication with the medical 
center in their locality, we see much better data coming from 
those centers and much more effective relationships and support 
of particularly those high risk clients that we're worried 
about.
    Senator Tillis. You would've thought that that connection 
would've just been systematized as standard operating 
procedure. Are there lapses and exactly what are veterans 
saying?
    Dr. Kroviak. We certainly see inconsistencies, lack of 
clarity----
    Senator Tillis. Does that mean that we're deviating from 
standard operating procedure or we haven't properly 
communicated SOP at that level?
    Dr. Kroviak. I think the effective oversight and 
communication to frontline staff has been inconsistent to 
understand how important, just what I described, connecting 
with the Vet Center, or connecting with the VA medical centers, 
knowing the names of the people that you need to reach out to 
for urgent and non-urgent issues, you know, really making that 
the community for a veteran.
    Senator Tillis. And Mr. Fisher, again, you're going to give 
me details on the outreach report?
    Mr. Fisher. Yes, sir.
    Senator Tillis. Then Mr. Chair, I will conclude at this 
point. Thank you.
    Chairman Tester. Thank you, Senator Tillis. Senator Hassan.

                   HON. MARGARET WOOD HASSAN,
                U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE

    Senator Hassan. Well, thanks, Mr. Chair, and to you and 
Ranking Member Moran for this hearing. And thank you to our 
witnesses, not only for being here today, but for the work that 
you do. Mr. Fisher, Vet Centers support the mental health needs 
of veterans who are transitioning out of the military. One of 
the most critical elements for a successful transition from the 
military into civilian life is building ties within the local 
community.
    So what are Vet Centers doing to help newly separated 
veterans build stronger connections within their surrounding 
communities, and what more should we be doing? One of the 
things I hear from veterans, and actually from community 
members is, ``We'd love to be there for our veterans. We don't 
necessarily know who they are. We don't know what they need.''
    Mr. Fisher. Sure. So the first thing is going out and 
creating community partnerships within those communities to 
welcome home all those who serve. And then from there, we, we 
decide which partners we are going to partner with based off of 
the needs of those local servicemember, veteran populations. 
We've talked previously about a new outreach application that 
we will be implementing that will give us access to all 
transitioning servicemembers. So we view that as an opportunity 
to be able to reach out to them as they come back into their 
community and begin those conversations, welcome them to a Vet 
Center, have them come and check it out, and then from there, 
use our partnership.
    Senator Hassan. Right. And have those partners kind of 
ready and able at those moments of----
    Mr. Fisher. Yes, ma'am.
    Senator Hassan [continuing]. The first visit, okay. So 
another question for you, because I want to dig more into one 
of the ways that we can build this sense of community, and 
that's peer support counseling, right? So, other VA offices 
such as the Women's Veterans Network have seen success in 
implementing these types of programs, which create peer support 
groups using trained peer support specialists. How can Vet 
Centers maximize opportunities to incorporate peer support 
models into the services that they offer?
    Mr. Fisher. Sure. So our view on peer support is veteran to 
veteran, which is why we hire a large number of veterans. All 
of our outreach staff are veterans, so they can have that 
shared experience. We will go out to the Office of Mental 
Health and Suicide Prevention to see if there's other 
opportunities around true peer supports that we can begin to 
leverage within Vet Centers that we can report back to you on 
our State.
    Senator Hassan. Sure. Look, the Veterans Service 
Organizations around my State have really raised this, and, you 
know, whether it's the Buddy Check program or other kinds of 
programs, what they're telling us and what veterans tell us is 
that, just knowing who the other veterans are in their 
communities and having that opportunity to find the right match 
is really important. So I'd love to hear more about that from 
you.
    Another question for you, Mr. Fisher. I'm particularly 
interested in how Vet Centers are tailoring their resources to 
meet the needs of women veterans. Women are the fastest growing 
group of veterans using VA services, tripling in number over 
the past two decades. So what type of specialized training do 
Vet Center employees receive on the unique military experiences 
and post-service needs of women veterans, and how does that 
training impact the care that these women receive?
    Mr. Fisher. Sure. So every new employee that comes into RCS 
goes through new employee orientation, in which we have a 
military culture block of instruction. And also have blocks 
instruction around working with women veterans. Every one of 
our districts also create training that is important to the 
needs within those local communities. Now, your second part of 
the question is, are we seeing that working? Our customer 
feedback scores, specifically our trust scores for women 
veterans are in line with the national average. So we're seeing 
that that work is successful.
    Senator Hassan. Okay. Just an aside, what I hear from women 
veterans in New Hampshire is simply they'd like to know where 
all the other women veterans are, you know, to talk to them, to 
have a relationship with them. So again, that talks to the kind 
of informal peer outreach and peer supports that you all can 
help build.
    And then last question for you, Mr. Fisher. The May 2022 
GAO report that Ms. Silas mentioned in her testimony, included 
a recommendation to assess how well Vet Centers are 
collectively meeting the needs of subgroups of veterans. Can 
you discuss the VA's implementation of this recommendation, 
what analyses have you completed, and how has Vet Center 
leadership made adjustments to services based on these 
analyses?
    Mr. Fisher. So we use our veteran signals, our V signals, 
customer feedback tool, to measure those things, which we 
rolled out in 2021. At the national level, we have enough data 
to be able to start looking at gender and other demographics. 
And what we're finding is that there is no real difference in 
trust scores. Our trust scores are still high. As we move 
forward and get more data specific to local Vet Centers, we can 
start trending and looking to see any opportunities within 
those local Vet Centers. Lastly, we've hired a customer 
experience officer whose role is to really dive down into where 
are our pockets within the country that we can improve around 
that experience.
    Senator Hassan. Okay, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Chairman Tester. Thank you, Senator Hassan. Senator Brown.

                      HON. SHERROD BROWN,
                     U.S. SENATOR FROM OHIO

    Senator Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm really kind of 
perplexed by all this. We have in my State, 700,000 veterans at 
least. I've done in the last since the PACT Act passed in 
August '20, which probably started right before that. I've done 
40 roundtables in 88 counties, and I have a full-time veteran 
staff person who does others of them that did. We go to 
Veterans Halls, we go to DAVs or Legions or AMVETS and 15 
veterans sit around the table and talk about all this.
    We have increasing mental health challenges based on all 
kinds of issues, from Vietnam Sense and we have, it seems, if 
not increasing rates of suicide, certainly far, far too many 
suicides. So why don't, Mr. Fisher, really all three of you, 
why don't I hear more about these centers? Why do I not hear 
more from veterans? Well, Ohio has 88 counties, each of the 
counties has a appointed office, veteran service office. Some 
of them 2 people, some of them 50 people in the big counties. 
And I'm talking to veterans all the time. We've been on this 
Committee with Chairman Tester for our whole careers. Why am I 
not hearing more about these centers? You want to start with 
you, Mr. Fisher, and then Dr. Kroviak, and then Ms. Silas.
    Mr. Fisher. Thank you for the question, Senator. I believe 
that just shows that we have more work to do to get the word 
out. Every Vet Center has outreach specific staff whose focus 
is to go out and not only create face-to-face connections with 
veterans, but create partnerships to get that word out.
    Lastly, as one of the GAO recommendations, we did roll out 
a survey to try to get a better understanding of why are 
individuals not understanding or getting more information about 
Vet Centers. We're analyzing the results of that and then we'll 
get into action planning from there.
    Senator Brown. Okay. Dr. Kroviak?
    Dr. Kroviak. Yes. And we do look at the outreach activities 
that are conducted at each Vet Center site, and they are not 
meeting the mark for the requirements of the number of 
activities. And that typically relates to competing priorities, 
workloads, acting positions, vacancies they're trying to 
compensate, so they're not consistently engaging in all the 
outreach activities that they certainly want to and could be.
    Senator Brown. Ms. Silas?
    Ms. Silas. I was just simply going to mention the same 
thing that Mr. Fisher mentioned about surveying veterans that 
are not already engaging with Vet Centers, and trying to gauge 
awareness, and let other veterans know what the services that 
are available, especially for some of those veterans that are 
at high risk for suicide.
    Senator Brown. So, thank you. My State's 12 million people. 
We have centers in some big cities, Toledo, Columbus, and then 
we have centers in a medium-sized city, Canton. And then we 
have centers in sort of suburban areas of big cities, Kettering 
near Dayton, Norwood near Cincinnati, Oakwood near Dayton, 
Parma Heights near Cleveland.
    Should there be more to serve 12 million--well, serve 
700,000 plus veterans? Should there be more of these? Should 
they be staffed at higher rates? You talked about falling short 
on outreach. What's the problem, Mr. Fisher?
    Mr. Fisher. I think to answer that question, while we have 
those seven locations, we also have additional multiple sites 
of care, which we call community access points that allow us to 
get into further communities. We can provide you with the 
number of community access points that we have in your State, 
but that allows us to get into those distant communities.
    Senator Brown. Okay. I have a bill that Daniel Harvey and 
Adam Lambert Improving Servicemember Transition to Reduce 
Veteran Service Suicide Act, to better prepare servicemembers 
for civilian lives--life for civilian life, I'm sorry, by 
connecting them with a VA social worker or nurse. Clearly, we 
need to, I assume you would support them, Mr. Fisher, do you 
know yet?
    Mr. Fisher. Yes, sir.
    Senator Brown. Okay. Would you then, and I'll, I'll stop, 
give some of my time back, Mr. Chairman. Would each of you tell 
Drew in my office, send me what we need to do, specifically 
chapter and verse so that people understand this service? 
Because I said, I rarely hear about this and I interact with 
veterans. Perhaps partly because of the size of my State, 
perhaps as much as anybody on this Committee except Senator 
Tester.
    And I just don't hear about this, when I hear about 
problems, I don't hear about this option enough. So would you 
give me each of the three of you, give my office a step-by-step 
playbook, if you will, on, sorry, the metaphor there, playbook 
on what we should be doing?
    Mr. Fisher. I think the first thing is making sure that we 
are committing to regularly scheduled updates with your staff 
to let them know what we're working on, where our challenges 
are, where our successes are within your State.
    Senator Brown. Okay. The other two of you would do that, 
please?
    Dr. Kroviak. If I could also add that as much as we would 
like to see the services expand, if your offices could locally 
support the recommendations in our report and the improvements 
needed. So enhancing and expanding the services won't help 
unless the shortcomings and findings that we have identified 
are resolved.
    Senator Brown. Ms. Silas?
    Ms. Silas. And I would just add, I mean, basically all 
three of the findings that we had in our report, if RCS 
implements those recommendations, it will help with outreach. 
It will help make sure that veterans are getting information 
about the services that are involved. And if they are 
continuing to do periodic assessments of barriers to care at 
Vet Centers, then they will also know where they need to kind 
of target their efforts to make sure that they're being more 
effective.
    Senator Brown. Okay. And of course, I didn't give any time 
back. Mr. Chairman, could I have another 30 seconds?
    Chairman Tester. Sure.
    Senator Brown. Thank you. How many on the average at these 
seven or any other around the country, how many people in the 
average work at one of the Vet Centers?
    Mr. Fisher. Between six and seven individuals.
    Senator Brown. Six and seven, okay. I mean, it just seems, 
when I'm doing these Veterans Roundtable, I said I've done 39, 
40, 41 of them and doing regularly, and a staff person's doing 
most of the other 80 of the 88 counties. I generally talk for 
two or three minutes at the outset, and then the rest of the 
time is questions and letting the 15 veterans, or asking 15 
veterans for questions.
    This is something I should announce at the beginning of 
every one of these, what services are available at the Vet 
Centers. And I don't do that because I don't know enough to do 
that. So I need help on that too.
    Mr. Fisher. Yes, sir.
    Senator Brown. Thank you.
    Chairman Tester. Thank you, Senator Brown. Senator King.

                    HON. ANGUS S. KING, JR.,
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM MAINE

    Senator King. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I want to 
thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member and the Committee 
staff for facilitating an authorized field hearing that we had 
in Maine last Friday on--it was fabulous--on long-term care. We 
had really good witnesses. We had veterans, we had officials 
from the VA, and it was very illuminating and educational and 
indicated, for example, that we have nursing home care and we 
have home-based care, but we have little, if any, assisted 
living coverage. There's a gap.
    And also the workforce problems, as you can imagine, were 
front and center. So it was an excellent hearing and thank you 
very much for facilitating that. We almost got closed down by a 
snowstorm, but we reminded them that their driver's license 
said Maine, not Arizona. So we managed to stay open.
    Chairman Tester. I'm going to have one in Montana.
    Senator King. There you go. First, Mr. Fisher, we, as you 
may recall, we had a problem with the Vet Center in Portland, 
fire hazard. They had to move, find temporary quarters. Joanne 
Boyle of District One, I want to acknowledge, did a lot of work 
to get us into temporary space. And we are looking, we believe 
that we'll have a permanent location by May. Do you have any 
information on that? Is that something that we can count on?
    Mr. Fisher. Yes. We are still on track to do that. I also 
want to thank your staff for helping us move into that 
temporary space, which is in the same building that our 
permanent location is.
    Senator King. Good. Excellent. There's a pilot under the 
Cleland-Dole Act for transportation to Vet Centers, and there's 
a part of it, one of them is in Bangor, and we have 68 veterans 
that are using it. But the implementation of the pilot seems to 
be stuck in rulemaking. And the rulemaking is, what constitutes 
financial hardship. When do you expect we're going to get the 
pilot operational, and this is really important for rural 
veterans. The top part of the State of Maine is extremely 
rural, and a lot of veterans up there, it's a long way to the 
nearest Vet Center. Talk to me about getting this pilot up and 
running.
    Mr. Fisher. Well, we expect the rulemaking process is 
averaging now 24 months to be able to get through. What's 
important to us----
    Senator King. Eisenhower retook Europe in 11 months.
    Mr. Fisher. Yes, sir.
    Senator King. Just say it.
    Mr. Fisher. Yes, sir. What's important to us is the public 
comment period. Because this is new, we want to make sure that 
we're accurately defining what the financial hardship is.
    Senator King. I understand that you want to have input, but 
let's get on with it.
    Mr. Fisher. Yes, sir.
    Senator King. In the meantime, we've got veterans that 
can't get to the Vet Center. How about workforce? The Vet 
Centers have limited staff. They're really dedicated people. 
Are you having the same--are the Vet Centers having the same 
workforce issues that practically everybody else is?
    Mr. Fisher. We are experiencing those workforce issues, and 
we're working to reduce those. Whether that is how we are 
looking at our time to fill and looking for other ways to bring 
on staff.
    Senator King. Your time to fill, as I look at the data, is 
better than VHAs however. I'll compliment you on that.
    Mr. Fisher. Thank you. Thank you.
    Senator King. Maybe that's damning with faint praise. I'm 
not sure.
    Mr. Fisher. I'm sorry, say that again.
    Senator King. Damning with faint praise.
    Mr. Fisher. Yes. I think we still have a lot of work to do 
to bring on staff faster.
    Senator King. I've looked down the list of all the things 
that the Vet Centers, the services, they provide really good 
important services. But we've had testimony here that one of 
the factors, particularly with regard to veteran suicide, is 
financial questions. And I wonder of your thoughts of adding 
financial counseling to this list of services VA benefits, 
screening, medical issues, substance abuse, financial advice, 
and counseling, I think could be an important adjunct to what 
the Vet Center provides.
    Mr. Fisher. Thank you for that suggestion. We actually have 
Vet Centers that have partnered with that type of community 
partner to be able to provide those services, but we can look 
into doing that in a more robust way.
    Senator King. I would urge you to take a serious look at 
that. And we have had testimony at this Committee that this is 
one of the suicide factors. And it strikes me as it fits well 
within the list of services that you are providing. I just want 
to thank you for the oversight and the work that you've done. 
Are you satisfied with implementation of your recommendations?
    Dr. Kroviak. We are satisfied with the action plans that 
are put forward to our recommendations. We are not as satisfied 
that we are repeatedly finding the same things as we go across 
different Vet Centers. So we would like the information in one 
report to be dispersed broadly across the system so that all 
the Vet Centers can use that as a risk assessment tool, even 
though it's not about their particular facility.
    Senator King. Well, my experience has been that the Vet 
Centers in Maine are a high return, low cost service very cost-
effective way of serving the needs, meeting the needs of 
veterans. And I know our veterans appreciate it. So keep it up. 
Thank you very much. Thank for your work. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Chairman Tester. Thank you, Senator King. Senator Sullivan.

                       HON. DAN SULLIVAN,
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA

    Senator Sullivan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Fisher, I 
wanted to kind of dig deep on a very specific Alaska issue. And 
I know my staff's been working with your team on it, but we are 
in the midst of a very heartbreaking spike in mental health 
challenges among our military members. Now, these are the 
active duty members, but you're probably tracking particularly 
the U.S. Army has had--just the number of suicides in the last, 
I think it's four to five years, has been 45--north of 45 in 
one region. I mean, this is more than--the numbers are like 
through the roof.
    I was literally just on the phone with the Secretary of 
Defense on this. And so the challenges that relate--so there's 
a lot of attention being brought to the active duty force in 
Alaska. But we are having, again some challenges on this issue 
as it relates to our veterans. You know, we're struggling with 
our work force with regard to the VA. We have more vets per 
capita in the State, in the country. But one of the things that 
I wanted to mention is that our Vet Centers are very busy 
places. They can provide both case management and mental health 
services.
    There's this comparison that I know that has been made at 
the VA here in DC about caseloads as high as 100 per provider. 
And our caseloads are about 50 per provider. And so I think the 
VA's either saying, ``Hey, you don't have a problem relative, 
or you guys are more inefficient.'' But the results is that no 
new providers are getting placed in our Vet Centers and we 
think we actually need them. The case managers have a lot more 
to manage in other States.
    For example, our hub and spoke model of healthcare means 
that coordinating both interstate and out-of-state is more 
common than other States. Travel in Alaska, as you know, is, 
you know, very challenging. We're a continental-wide State, 
almost three times as big as Texas. We have less road miles 
than Connecticut. Seasonal depression rates are higher due to 
the winters. So even though we have might have smaller per 
capita caseloads, our workers we see are overwhelmed, and the 
formula at the VA is saying there should be no new placements 
in Alaska.
    So what I wanted to do that we need to get more efficient 
before we get more workers. So what I wanted to do, I know 
that's a big windup, but I wanted to work with you and your 
team on how the VA formula can be reevaluated to better reflect 
some of the realities on the ground. As you guys know, one size 
doesn't fit all. And would you commit to working with me and my 
office on these issues? And I know we've been talking to your 
team about it.
    Mr. Fisher. Yes, we will commit to that. We'll do a deep 
dive into service provision there to see where our 
opportunities are.
    Senator Sullivan. Good. Let me turn to another, the 
Cleland-Dole Act, which I voted for, required the VA to hire 50 
full-time employees for Vet Centers to expand mental health 
services. The bill required the VA to select 50 different 
locations with unique geography. Were any added to the Vet 
Centers in Alaska, do you know under that, or are you guys 
still implementing that?
    Mr. Fisher. None of the positions were identified for 
Alaska, but we have other opportunities to increase our 
workforce and I think that goes back to the deep dive that 
we'll commit to.
    Senator Sullivan. Okay. Good. And let me ask one final 
question. Are we seeing any--so I'm very Alaska focused, but of 
course we're here in the U.S. Senate, so I care about all 
veterans. Are we seeing any kind of positive signs on veteran 
mental health or suicide issues nationally, or are the trends 
still trending in a direction that is continuing to be 
alarming?
    And, you know it's an issue that of course this Committee 
cares a lot about. But what are the trend lines and is there 
anything in terms of a silver lining that we're seeing with 
regard to veteran issues, particularly veteran suicide?
    Mr. Fisher. Well, I'm going to speak to Vet Centers 
specific, and I'm going to go to our customer feedback, our 
trust scores. And that is, we find that Vet Centers trust us to 
improve their quality of life. And that means to me, we need to 
make sure we're providing the right services that meet the 
needs in those local communities, that keep those veterans and 
servicemembers engaged in services, and then to be able to feel 
comfortable enough to voice that if they're having a bad day, 
to say that out loud.
    Senator Sullivan. Okay. Good. But the national trends, 
that's kind of a little bit beyond the mission of the Vet 
Centers that you're focused on? In terms of what you can tell 
this Committee.
    Mr. Fisher. Yes, sir.
    Senator Sullivan. Anyone else on the panel? Do you guys 
have a view on that?
    Dr. Kroviak. So in terms of oversight, the reason we're so 
involved in overseeing these Vet Centers is because of that. 
That VHA is not making the gains that it would like to in 
reducing veteran suicide and the risk for veteran suicide. I'll 
add that our oversight teams are actually in Alaska this week. 
So they will be looking at Vet Centers in your State this week.
    Senator Sullivan. Look, when the Vet Centers are there, I 
agree with Mr. Fisher, the response, you know, it's been great. 
Right? They're really great facilities and so I think it's a 
wonderful program, innovative, and maybe it's too early to tell 
the impact, but I would hope that we're going to start to see 
some kind of positive impact, particularly on this issue that 
all of us really care about, which is veteran suicide and these 
rates that are heartbreaking and no one wants to see those 
rates continue. But you think it's too early to tell, Doctor?
    Dr. Kroviak. Is your question, is it too early to tell, to 
tell the impact of Vet Centers----
    Senator Sullivan. Yes.
    Dr. Kroviak [continuing]. On the suicide rate?
    Senator Sullivan. Yes.
    Dr. Kroviak. Well, I can tell you because we're finding 
consistent shortcomings in the coordination and the steps 
needed to ensure a veteran's safety in a Vet Center when 
they're deemed high risk, I think until we see those 
improvements at the local Vet Centers, it is hard to say what 
type of impact they're having. But we would be happy to reach 
out to you when we have our conclusions from the sites we visit 
in Alaska to get some----
    Senator Sullivan. That would be great.
    Dr. Kroviak [continuing]. Some local insight into what 
we're finding.
    Senator Sullivan. Great. I appreciate it. All right. Thank 
you, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate it.
    Chairman Tester. Thank you, Senator Sullivan. I do want to 
thank the witnesses here. I think this whole Committee looks 
forward to continuing to work to make sure the Vet Centers are 
the best they can be. I would say whether it's a GAO 
recommendation or an IG recommendation, really should roll up 
the sleeves and get those closed as quickly as possible. I 
think the GAO recommendations have been out there since May of 
last year. That's a long time.
    And I know it's hard to say because we don't have a lot of 
urgency in the United States Senate or Congress in general, but 
you have to do better than us. Okay? I'll appreciate that. 
Making sure that we're meeting the needs of the servicemembers 
and the veterans and the families, is what this Committee is 
about. And I think that's the same charge you have, Michael, 
and I appreciate your work, when we can always do better.
    We will keep the record open for a week. Until then, this 
hearing is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 4:48 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
