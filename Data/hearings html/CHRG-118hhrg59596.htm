        SECTOR DOWN: ENSURING CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE RESILIENCE

                              ----------                              


                        Thursday, June 27, 2024

             U.S. House of Representatives,
                    Committee on Homeland Security,
                         Subcommittee on Cybersecurity and 
                                 Infrastructure Protection,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:04 p.m., in 
room 310, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. Andrew R. 
Garbarino [Chairman of the subcommittee] presiding.
    Present: Representatives Garbarino, Ezell, Lee, Luttrell, 
and Swalwell.
    Mr. Garbarino. The Committee on Homeland Security's 
Subcommittee on Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection 
will come to order.
    The purpose of this hearing is to understand cyber 
stakeholders' responses to a catastrophic cyber attack on 
various critical infrastructure sectors, such as energy, water, 
and health care. Additionally, this hearing will emphasize the 
role of cyber insurance and organizational preparedness and 
recovery, including what cyber insurance is, what it covers, 
and how to ensure it gives organizations confidence that they 
will not be alone at their most vulnerable moment.
    I now recognize myself for an opening statement. Let's 
imagine some scenarios for our critical infrastructure: Our 
electrical grid goes down, our hospitals are taken off-line, 
our water systems are shut down indefinitely, we are unable to 
make transactions. Each one of these scenarios is nothing short 
of catastrophic for our economy and for our national security 
interests, especially if we do not know how quickly they can be 
resolved. From health care to banking, we depend on each one of 
these sectors daily, such that it may seem unfathomable to have 
one of them go down.
    However, rapidly-evolving tactics in cyber space heighten 
the possibility of their recurrence each and every day. 
Recognizing that--recognizing the wide-spread damage that these 
events would cause, our public and private sectors must be 
prepared to respond quickly, effectively, and collaboratively. 
Due to this, entities must know what to--must know who to go 
to, how much of the damage they will be responsible for 
covering, and what assistance will be available to them. This 
will help them develop a proactive recovery plan before a major 
attack occurs, rather than scrambling when they are at their 
most vulnerable point.
    Given the nature of threats is changing and impacts vary, 
the cyber insurance industry is a critical--is critical to 
determining how nimble we can respond. This is a challenge 
today, because absent a major attack, our standards for 
coverage are still being defined. However, we should have hope; 
with clearer expectations for cyber insurance coverage, there 
is promise for mitigating risks to individual companies and 
broader society.
    For example, cyber insurance providers can help cover the 
financial cost of a cyber attack much like any other form of 
insurance. We can also build off the work firms are already 
doing. Currently, many firms provide cyber analytics for 
covered companies and look for potential vulnerabilities in 
advance of a cyber attack. Some also provide legal defense for 
any compromised data, while others have best practices and 
recommendations for resiliency that they provide to clients.
    We are here today to dig into these issues by exploring a 
range of scenarios to think through the development of the 
standards. We must start with basic--with a basic understanding 
of what cyber insurance is, and what is currently covered under 
a range of circumstances. This will inform our discussion about 
what should be covered.
    The U.S. Government also plays a pivotal role in responding 
to major cyber attacks on our critical infrastructure. Private-
sector companies cannot be expected to handle the impact of 
nation-state attacks alone. Although we do not have our Federal 
partners present today, I hope that we can have a robust 
discussion about existing Federal mechanisms for incident 
response in a major attack. This will help us understand where 
our private-sector partners might need more help, and where we 
can strengthen and clarify our lines of communication with 
public/private partnerships.
    We have a unique opportunity to revisit incident response 
for critical infrastructure given Federal action that has 
unfolded in recent months. For example, as this subcommittee 
examined last month, CISA will begin work on the final SOSIA 
rule soon, which aims to create proactive Federal standard for 
incident reporting.
    Additionally, the recent release of the National Security 
Memorandum 22 reaffirmed the 16 critical infrastructure sectors 
and has now kick-started the rewrite of sector-specific plans 
for sector risk management agencies. These have not been 
updated for almost 10 years, despite dramatically different--
despite a dramatically different threat landscape. The new 
sector-specific plans will feed into CISA's development of the 
2025 National Infrastructure Risk Management Plan. This hearing 
is a good opportunity to examine how the sector risk management 
agencies manage collective risk and how CISA executes its role 
as national coordinator.
    I want to thank our witnesses for being here to help us 
understand the complex cyber threat landscape against our 
critical infrastructure sectors, and how the cyber ecosystem, 
government owners and operators, insurance providers, and 
others can improve their coordination and collaboration. My 
goal is for us to leave this hearing with a better grasp of 
what is working well among these partners, and where we need to 
improve our relationships and response processes.

    Good afternoon everyone.
    Let's imagine some scenarios for our critical infrastructure: Our

    I want to thank our witnesses for being here to help us understand

    My goal is for us to leave this hearing with a better grasp of what 
is working well among these partners, and where we need to improve our 
relationships and response processes.

    Mr. Garbarino. I now recognize the Ranking Member, the 
gentleman from California, Mr. Swalwell, for his opening 
statement.
    Mr. Swalwell. I thank the Chairman. This is quite timely of 
a hearing, and, in fact, too often quite prescient, because 
we'll hold a hearing on an issue, and then we'll realize in a 
couple months that we were really just circling the target as 
far as what we are vulnerable to. That's really a credit, I 
think, to the Chairman and his team and his members, and also, 
our team and our colleagues who have, for the last, I guess, 
19, 20 months, really been aligned in taking on this threat.
    I also want to welcome--and want to welcome all of you as 
witnesses, but particularly Jack Kudale from Cowbell Insurance. 
Cowbell is headquartered in Pleasanton, California, which is in 
the heart of my Congressional district. As you will learn, they 
are insuring small- and medium-size businesses up to 
approximately $250 million in revenue.
    That's who the Chairman and I--as we talk about cyber, 
that's who we worry about the most, are the small- and medium-
size businesses, because, look, the giants, we want to make 
sure that, you know, they're taken care of in their cyber 
hygiene, awareness, staff, but the giants often are going to 
have a CISO and a full team and outside consultants and 
advisers, but it's really small- and medium-size businesses who 
are also bolted onto so much of critical infrastructure that 
they don't. Having folks like Cowbell and just this emerging 
insurance industry helping them understand the risk, price the 
risk, and then backstop the risk is really important. So I look 
forward to that conversation.
    According to the FBI's IC3, cyber crime costs Americans 
$12.5 billion in 2023, which was a 20 percent increase in 
losses from 2022, and we expect it will only go up in this 
coming year. They've reported that 40 percent of ransomware 
attacks in 2023 targeted critical infrastructure, making cyber 
attacks not only expensive, but potentially disruptive.
    That's also, in part, why I support what the Chairman was 
referencing in undoing the SEC reporting rule and making it 
more, I would say, adaptive to the real-life, real-time 
decisions that folks have to make to decide if they're 
undergoing a cyber attack or if they are just experiencing a 
software upgrade issue. But we don't want them spending too 
much time with lawyers and not enough time with cyber 
professionals as they take on and try to understand what is 
hitting them.
    Fortunately, on most realms, the Biden administration is 
leading a range of efforts to bring the unique capabilities of 
Government and the private sector together in new ways to 
confront emerging cyber threats. They've laid out, as you've 
heard in this committee over and over, the National 
Cybersecurity Strategy. Three important initiatives relevant to 
this hearing of that strategy is stabilizing the insurance 
market, maturing operational collaboration, and improving our 
ability to understand the cascading effects of cyber attacks so 
we can mitigate the impacts and respond more dynamically.
    Cyber insurance policies have long served as a 
nonregulatory way to incentivize the adoption of cybersecurity 
controls and blunt the losses of cyber attacks that overcome 
network defenses. I've heard from Jack and others that in this 
industry, this early in its evolution, the most successful 
companies are not the companies that have the most policy 
holders, because it's still too difficult to price the risk, 
and that they seek to do that in their endeavors. But what we 
can do here in Government left of boom, left of an attack, is 
to better help create standards and incentives, and, perhaps, 
grant programs and tax deductions to help small- and medium-
size businesses protect themselves left of boom so that we can 
have a broader insurance market that protects all of us.
    But increases in the frequency of attacks and 
sophistication have cost cyber incidents, along with the lack 
of historical data, lack of models to accurately assess risk, 
and lack of consistency in terminology and coverage have 
created a lot of friction in the cyber insurance market. These 
dynamics have created a perfect storm. Demand for cyber 
insurance has increased, premiums have gone up, and some 
insurers are reluctant to write new policies. So we are in a 
unique position to bring certainty and stability to the market, 
and I'm glad that the Biden administration is seeking to do 
that.
    Notably, the administration has prioritized identifying 
ways the Federal Government can help address gaps in the cyber 
insurance market, particularly related to coverage for 
catastrophic cyber incidents. The administration is 2 years 
into assessing the need for and potential structures of a 
Federal backstop to a catastrophic cyber event, and I look at 
this somewhat in the same framework of the Terrorism 
Reinsurance Project, TRIA, that we have funded in years past.
    Without Government intervention, we run the risk of cyber 
insurers being over-extended when a catastrophic cyber incident 
occurs or writing policies that include so many exemptions that 
no one can make a claim. The Biden administration has also 
relaunched the cyber insurance and data analysis working group, 
CDAWG--not a rap or hip hop band, but a Biden administration 
policy. It would also probably be a cool rap or hip hop band.
    Mr. Garbarino. In another life, you can do it.
    Mr. Swalwell. Yeah. Yeah, exactly, in another life.
    At CISA, CDAWG help insurers better analyze risks by 
identifying the security controls that are most effective in 
improving access to data. Enhancing our ability to evaluate 
risk will help the cyber insurance market at every level, 
making cyber insurance more attractive and accessible. 
Ultimately, higher rates of cyber insurance uptake will reduce 
systemic risk and yield dividends in resilience.
    I'm looking forward to our witnesses' perspectives on what 
more the Federal Government could be doing to strengthen the 
cyber insurance market. I was encouraged that the National 
Security Memorandum 22 recommitted the administration to 
building operational collaboration.
    So very much look forward to this hearing, Mr. Chairman, 
and I'll turn it back to you so we can hear from our witnesses.

               Statement of Ranking Member Eric Swalwell
                             June 27, 2024
    Malicious cyber actors--whether state-sponsored or cyber 
criminals--are growing more sophisticated, bolder, and more prolific, 
and it is costing us. According to the FBI's IC3, cyber crime cost 
Americans $12.5 billion in 2023, a 22 percent increase in losses from 
2022. IC3 also reported that 40 percent of ransomware attacks in 2023 
targeted critical infrastructure, making cyber attacks not only 
expensive but potentially disruptive.
    Fortunately, the Biden administration is leading a range of efforts 
to bring the unique capabilities of Government and the private sector 
together in new ways to confront evolving cyber threats. The 
administration is making important progress on the ambitious agenda it 
set in the National Cybersecurity Strategy and is modernizing the 
doctrine that defines how we build collective resilience.
    Three initiatives are particularly relevant to this hearing: 
stabilizing the cyber insurance market; maturing operational 
collaboration; and improving our ability to understand the cascading 
effects of cyber attacks so we can mitigate the impacts and respond 
more dynamically.
    Cyber insurance policies have long served as a non-regulatory way 
to incentivize the adoption of cybersecurity controls and blunt the 
losses of cyber attacks that overcome network defenses. Unfortunately, 
increases in the frequency, sophistication, and cost of cyber incidents 
along with the lack of historical data, lack of models to accurately 
assess risk, and lack of consistency in terminology and policy coverage 
have created friction in the cyber insurance market. These dynamics 
have created a perfect storm--demand for cyber insurance has increased, 
premiums have gone up, and some insurers are reluctant to write new 
policies.
    The Federal Government is in a unique position to bring certainty 
and stability to the market and I am glad the Biden administration is 
working to do just that. Notably, the administration has prioritized 
identifying ways the Federal Government can help address gaps in the 
cyber insurance market, particularly related to coverage for 
catastrophic cyber incidents.
    The administration is 2 years into assessing the need for--and 
potential structures of--a Federal backstop to a catastrophic cyber 
event. Without Government intervention, we run the risk of cyber 
insurers being overextended when a catastrophic cyber incident occurs, 
or writing policies that include so many exemptions that no one can 
make a claim. Neither scenario is good for our economy or national 
security, and I look forward to supporting on-going efforts to find a 
solution.
    The Biden administration has also re-launched the Cyber Insurance 
and Data Analysis Working Group (CIDAWG) at CISA, which will help 
insurers better analyze risk by identifying the security controls that 
are most effective and improving access to data. Enhancing our ability 
to evaluate risk will help the cyber insurance market at every level, 
making cyber insurance more attractive and accessible. Ultimately 
higher rates of cyber insurance uptake will reduce systemic risk and 
yield dividends in resilience.
    I'm looking forward to our witnesses' perspectives on what more the 
Federal Government could be doing to strengthen the cyber insurance 
market. Another area where the Government is uniquely suited to bring 
value is operational collaboration. No other entity has the same 
convening power or intelligence insights that can help the private 
sector make better sense of the activity they are seeing on their 
networks.
    I was encouraged that National Security Memorandum 22 recommitted 
the administration to building operational collaboration capacity. 
CISA, the National Coordinator for the Security and Resilience of 
Critical Infrastructure, has been modernizing its approach to 
operational collaboration for almost 3 years with the Joint Cyber 
Defense Collaborative (JCDC). I will be interested in hearing from the 
witnesses today how operational collaboration bodies like the JCDC can 
more strategically leverage public and private-sector competencies to 
boost resilience.
    Finally, the Government has an important role to play in bringing 
greater clarity to the interdependencies and cascading consequences of 
cyber attacks. Earlier this year, for example, we were caught 
flatfooted after the Change Healthcare ransomware attack. It took too 
long to understand the broader impacts on the health care system, and 
it limited our ability to respond nimbly.
    I was encouraged that NSM-22 directed CISA to identify key 
interdependencies that would be implicated by cyber attacks so we can 
better manage risk. I look forward to working with CISA to improve its 
ability to conduct that type of analysis.

    Mr. Garbarino. Thank you, Mr. Swalwell.
    Other Members of the committee are reminded that opening 
statements may be submitted for the record.
    [The statement of Ranking Member Thompson follows:]
             Statement of Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson
                             June 27, 2024
    In the past several years, significant cyber incidents have 
demonstrated how an impact on one entity can have wider implications 
across a critical infrastructure sector or for the broader U.S. 
economy.
    Whether it was the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in 2021, 
which resulted in gas shortages across the East Coast, or the recent 
Change Healthcare ransomware attack, which stalled payments to medical 
providers across the country, cyber attacks are having real-world 
impacts. Preventing these incidents in the first place must be a top 
priority, but we must also ensure that critical infrastructure is 
resilient and that we are adequately prepared to respond and recover 
from cyber incidents.
    One way to improve critical infrastructure resilience is the 
increased use of cyber insurance, which can encourage better 
cybersecurity practices and help ensure that companies have the 
resources to respond to and recover from a cyber incident. We know 
there are major challenges in the cyber insurance market, with 
providers reluctant to offer coverage when it is difficult to assess 
risk.
    With the extent of cyber-related losses depending on technological 
changes and geopolitical uncertainties, cyber insurers have to 
underwrite policies with limited information. In particular, the 
potential for catastrophic losses across many entities in the event of 
a major cyber attack or global conflict creates significant risk for 
insurers.
    I am glad to see the Biden administration has taken the lead on 
evaluating the potential for a Federal backstop, and I look forward to 
on-going engagement with our administration partners and private-sector 
stakeholders on assessing whether one is needed. I look forward to 
hearing from our witnesses today about how they see the current state 
of the cyber insurance market and how the Federal Government can play a 
better role in supporting it.
    Additionally, ensuring critical infrastructure resilience will 
require improving operational collaboration between the Federal 
Government and critical infrastructure. CISA's Joint Cyber Defense 
Collaborative, or JCDC, has significant potential to facilitate the 
kind of public-private partnerships that will improve resilience and 
incident response. Passing Ranking Member Swalwell's legislation to 
authorize and provide structure to the JCDC is critical to ensuring the 
JCDC can fully realize operational collaboration going forward.
    Today's hearing will give the subcommittee an opportunity to hear 
from stakeholders about how CISA is collaborating with critical 
infrastructure and how we can ensure that it provides the necessary 
support to improve resilience.

 STATEMENT OF FRANK J. CILLUFFO, DIRECTOR, MC CRARY INSTITUTE 
 FOR CYBER AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY, UNIVERSITY OF 
                             AUBURN

    Mr. Cilluffo. Chairman Garbarino, Ranking Member Swalwell, 
Congressman Luttrell, thank you for the opportunity to testify 
before you today. The cyber threat continues to grow in scale, 
scope, and complexity with nation-state actors, cyber 
criminals, and other malicious entities creating significant 
risk to our national security, economic prosperity, and public 
safety.
    If there's a conflict brewing somewhere, rest assured 
there's a cyber element to it. Cyber capabilities have become 
integral to modern warfare strategy and doctrine, whether 
through computer network attack, computer network exploit or 
espionage, intelligence preparation of the battlefield, or 
disinformation and misinformation to expand the fog of war.
    While threats come in various shapes, sizes, and forms, the 
People's Republic of China tops the list as an existential 
threat to U.S. networks. Chinese state-sponsored actors like 
Volt Typhoon have demonstrated their intent to shift from 
espionage to prepositioning in a concerning escalation. Volt 
Typhoon has been particularly active in targeting American 
facilities in Guam, the strategically important U.S. territory 
in the Pacific. It has compromised organizations across various 
critical infrastructure sectors and is living off the so-called 
land.
    Beyond direct nation-state threats, countries are 
increasingly turning to proxies to conduct cyber operations, 
allowing nation-states to mask their identity and maintain 
plausible deniability. This blurs the line between state-
sponsored activities in cyber crime, making both attribution 
and response more challenging. Russia, for example, has become 
a safe haven for ransomware gangs complicating any effort to 
combat them.
    Ransomware is hitting epidemic proportions, as we know, 
putting a target on everyone's back and impacting organizations 
of all sizes across every sector of our economy and society. 
The landscape is rapidly evolving. Our approaches to 
cybersecurity must evolve, too. The increasing sophistication, 
the expanding attack surface, and impact of cyber threats 
demand a reimagining of our defense strategies, particularly 
public/private partnerships.
    To date, our cybersecurity posture has largely been 
reactive, responding to incidents, putting out fires. This is 
unsustainable, and we can no longer simply firewall our way out 
of the problem. We must recalibrate and shift toward more 
proactive and collaborative approaches that leverage the full 
spectrum of national capabilities. This includes identifying 
and protecting systemically-important entities, or SIEs, whose 
compromise could have significant cascading effects on our 
security and stability.
    National Security Memorandum 22, promulgated earlier this 
year, introduced a concept of SIEs. While I applaud the 
guidance writ large, one significant shortcoming was not 
designating space systems, which underpin a wide range of 
critical services as a critical infrastructure sector.
    Robust public/private relationships are essential to secure 
SIEs. Government and industry must actively collaborate to 
secure these entities, and to turbo-charge this effort we need 
to move beyond the traditional information-sharing approach and 
into a joint threat analysis coordinated incident response and 
shared responsibility for risk mitigation.
    The Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative, or JCDC, represents 
a strong model, but it needs to scale. We also need to launch 
sector-specific approaches that address unique challenges and 
needs. Project Fortress from U.S. Treasury is a promising 
example of Government and industry sitting side-by-side in the 
same foxhole moving beyond defense to include possible 
offensive capabilities.
    We must not lose sight of the backbone of our economy, as I 
think, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, you both brought up. 
The backbone is small- and medium-size businesses. Any 
solutions should allow them to both benefit from and contribute 
to our collective defense.
    Exploring innovative models for risk-sharing, such as new 
insurance frameworks and Government backstops for catastrophic 
incidents, is crucial. The cyber insurance market is beginning 
to stabilize, but nation-state threats often exceed the scope 
of traditional policies creating a coverage gap that leaves 
many organizations vulnerable in instances of war, significant 
nation-state actors, and attacks on critical infrastructure.
    While insurers can and must incentivize better security 
practices, market forces alone are unlikely to fully address 
the full spectrum of risk. Developing a cyber insurance 
framework similar to the TRIA, Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, 
could provide a solution but only if Government intervention is 
carefully designed to complement private-sector efforts, not 
replace them.
    As we move forward, striking the right balance between 
Government involvement and private-sector innovation is vital. 
We must be careful not to stifle growth, innovation, or cause 
moral hazard while providing the necessary support for 
catastrophic risk.
    In conclusion, the threat landscape demands a bold, 
collaborative and adaptive response. After all, how many 
businesses--even the biggest--went into business thinking they 
had to defend themselves against foreign militaries and foreign 
intelligence services? Yet, that is precisely the challenge our 
critical infrastructure operators today face. This asymmetry 
demands new models.
    By leveling up collaboration and translating nouns into 
verbs between Government and industry, developing sector-
specific approaches and exploring innovative models for risk 
sharing, we can effectively mitigate the risk of catastrophic 
cyber incidents and safeguard our critical infrastructure.
    Sorry for going over, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Cilluffo follows:]
                Prepared Statement of Frank J. Cilluffo
                             June 27, 2024
                              introduction
    Chairman Garbarino, Ranking Member Swalwell, and distinguished 
subcommittee Members thank you for the opportunity to testify before 
you today on a subject that is clearly of national importance. Your 
oversight in examining these critical topics is commendable.
    In my remarks today, I aim to provide an overview of the landscape 
of cyber threats, highlighting their growing complexity and 
seriousness. The cyber threat can no longer be treated in isolation, 
because it plays a central role in global crises and flashpoints. It's 
impossible to examine cyber issues without an appreciation for the 
geopolitical environment and global crises in all contexts. Cyber 
threats have evolved from a niche concern to a core issue in all 
conflicts. I will shed light on the various players involved, including 
nation-states and cyber criminals, along with their advanced strategies 
like leveraging proxies and employing ``living off the land'' tactics.
    Furthermore, my testimony will delve into the impact of National 
Security Memorandum 22 (NSM 22) and its guidelines for identifying 
Systemically Important Entities. This will highlight the significance 
of adopting a cybersecurity approach that considers the 
interconnectedness within our infrastructure framework.
    Moreover, I will discuss the pressing need to revamp and strengthen 
our private partnerships. By reviewing initiatives such as the Joint 
Cyber Defense Collaborative and Project Fortress, I hope to demonstrate 
how these models can be expanded and customized to establish resilient 
and proactive defense mechanisms across various sectors.
    Last, I will discuss how the insurance industry can encourage 
improved cybersecurity practices and the potential for a national 
strategy to deal with severe cyber risks. By assessing the landscape of 
cyber insurance and suggesting ways to better calibrate Government 
involvement, I aim to highlight the delicate balance between private-
sector creativity and essential Government assistance.
    It is important to note that our historical cybersecurity posture 
has been largely reactive, primarily focused on responding to incidents 
and putting out fires. This approach is no longer sufficient in the 
face of evolving and sophisticated threats. We cannot simply 
``firewall'' our way out of the problem. Instead, we must shift toward 
a more proactive defense strategy that focuses on managing risks, 
minimizing potential impacts, and building resilience across our 
critical infrastructure and key sectors.
    Going forward, our approach to cybersecurity needs to be adaptable, 
cooperative, and forward-looking. The time is ripe for decisive efforts 
to move beyond reactive measures. By fostering stronger collaborations 
between the public and private sectors and taking strategic government 
actions, we can bolster our country's ability to anticipate, prevent, 
and mitigate cyber threats rather than merely responding to them after 
the fact. This proactive stance is essential to effectively protect our 
national security, economic interests, and public safety in the digital 
age.
                 overview of the cyber threat landscape
    The cyber threat landscape facing the United States is becoming 
increasingly complex and dangerous, with nation-state actors, cyber 
criminals, and other malicious entities creating significant risks to 
our national security, economic prosperity, and public safety.
    In today's geopolitical environment, it's increasingly difficult to 
imagine any conflict without a significant cyber element. Cyber 
capabilities have become integral to modern warfare and geopolitical 
strategy, whether through direct cyber attacks, espionage for target 
selection, intelligence preparation of the battlefield (pre-
positioning), or the use of disinformation and misinformation to create 
a fog of war.
    While cyber threats come in various shapes, sizes, and forms, 
nation-state threats remain at the forefront of our concerns. The 
People's Republic of China is ``the most active and persistent cyber 
threat to U.S. Government, private sector, and critical infrastructure 
networks.''\1\ Chinese state-sponsored actors, such as Volt Typhoon, 
have shown a growing willingness to compromise and hold at risk 
critical infrastructure systems, even those without inherent espionage 
value.\2\ This shift from traditional espionage to pre-positioning is a 
concerning escalation.

    While China poses the most significant threat, Russia, Iran, and 
North Korea are also conducting malicious cyber activities against U.S. 
interests. These and other adversaries are increasingly extending 
geopolitical conflict into the cyber domain for geopolitical conflict, 
further amplifying risks to U.S. and allied critical infrastructure.\7\

    \7\ Office of the National Cyber Director.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Beyond direct nation-state threat actors, nation-states are 
increasingly turning to proxies to conduct their cyber operations.\8\ 
The use of proxies allows a given nation-state to mask their identity 
and skirt international law while maintaining plausible deniability. 
This tactic blurs the lines between state-sponsored activities and 
cyber crime, making attribution and response more challenging. For 
instance, Russia has become a safe haven for ransomware criminals by 
allowing these actors to operate with impunity on their soil, 
complicating international efforts to combat this growing threat. 
Further, the use of proxies complicates our ability to defend against 
and deter such attacks and raises significant policy challenges around 
how to respond and hold accountable the true orchestrators of these 
cyber activities.

    The ransomware threat continues to grow and has effectively 
democratized the threat landscape, putting a target on everyone's back. 
No longer is this threat confined to large corporations or high-profile 
targets; it now impacts organizations of all sizes across every sector. 
In 2023, nearly 5,200 organizations reported ransomware attacks, and 
countless more attacks have likely gone unreported.\9\ Ransomware's 
impact extends beyond financial losses, with such attacks disrupting 
critical services and potentially threatening lives. For instance, a 
November 2023 attack on Ardent Health Services, a 30-hospital system, 
put lives at risk by forcing diversions across 3 States.\10\

    Financially, the costs are significant. Ransom payments in the 
first half of 2023 were estimated to be $449 million, while individual 
attacks on major corporations resulted in hundreds of millions in 
losses.\11\ The MGM Resorts attack in September 2023 is estimated to 
have cost at least $100 million, while the August 2023 Clorox attack is 
estimated to have cost at least $356 million.\12\ Further, the systemic 
risk to critical infrastructure cannot be overstated. As demonstrated 
by the ICBC attack in late 2023, even a relatively small entity can 
have an outsized impact on critical systems like the U.S. Treasury 
market.\13\

can enhance defensive capabilities, it also provides cyber criminals

    As we confront this evolving threat landscape, it is clear that our 
approaches to cybersecurity need to evolve, too. The increasing 
sophistication, scale, and potential impact of cyber threats demand a 
reimagining of our defense strategies, particularly public-private 
partnerships. We must move beyond reactive postures and information 
sharing to more proactive, collaborative approaches that leverage the 
full spectrum of national capabilities.
                    systemically important entities
    We must identify and prioritize protecting entities whose 
compromise could have cascading effects on our national security, 
economic stability, and public health and safety. The concept of 
Systemically Important Entities (SIEs) emerged as a crucial framework 
for understanding and addressing the interconnected and interdependent 
nature of our critical infrastructure.
    The recently-issued National Security Memorandum 22 (NSM-22) 
introduces the concept of SIEs, acknowledging that specific 
organizations and systems have far-reaching impacts that extend beyond 
their immediate sectors.\16\ This recognition is a significant step 
forward in our national cybersecurity strategy, as it aims to mitigate 
the potential for wide-spread disruption that could result from attacks 
on these key entities.

security-and-resilience/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The criteria for designating SIEs, as outlined in NSM-22, are based 
on the potential for an entity's disruption or malfunction to cause 
nationally significant and cascading adverse effects. This updated 
approach reflects a more current understanding of the complex 
interdependencies within our critical infrastructure ecosystem. 
Considering sectors in isolation is no longer sufficient, we must adopt 
a holistic view that accounts for the ripple effects of cyber incidents 
across our interconnected systems.
    One example is the ``tri-sector'' approach, which emphasizes the 
critical and interrelated nature of the finance, energy, and 
telecommunications sectors.\17\ These sectors form the backbone of our 
modern economy and society, and their resilience is paramount to our 
national security. The energy sector warrants particular attention due 
to its fundamental role in enabling all other critical infrastructure 
operations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \17\ CISA Cybersecurity Advisory Committee, ``Building Resilience 
and Reducing Systemic Risk to Critical Infrastructure'' (Cybersecurity 
and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), September 13, 2022).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    It is important to note that the designation of SIEs extends beyond 
these 3 sectors. The designation and support processes must be dynamic 
and adaptive as threats and technology change. For instance, the 
increasing reliance on cloud computing and space-based assets 
necessitates reevaluating what constitutes critical infrastructure in 
the 21st Century. This flexibility allows for the inclusion of other 
functions that may not fall neatly into traditional sector definitions, 
ensuring a comprehensive approach to critical infrastructure 
protection.
    While considering what constitutes critical infrastructure in the 
21st Century, it's crucial to recognize emerging domains that play an 
increasingly vital role in national and economic security. One such 
domain is space. The space sector underpins a wide range of critical 
services, from communication and navigation to surveillance and weather 
forecasting. Space infrastructure is vital to civil and military 
operations, making it a prime candidate for designation as a critical 
infrastructure sector. While NSM-22 takes significant strides in 
updating our approach to critical infrastructure protection, the 
omission of space as a designated sector represents a missed 
opportunity that should be addressed in future policy updates.\18\

House's New Critical Infrastructure Directive,'' CyberScoop (blog), May 
1, 2024, https://cyberscoop.com/how-to-fine-tune-the-white-houses-new-
critical-infrastructure-directive/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Regardless, the identification and protection of SIEs require 
robust public-private partnerships. Government and industry must 
actively collaborate to secure these entities. This collaboration must 
go beyond the traditional ``information sharing'' approach and move 
into joint threat analysis, coordinated incident response, and shared 
responsibility for risk mitigation. Now is the time to reimagine and 
deepen our public-private cyber partnerships.
    Furthermore, we must recognize that the concept of SIEs has 
international implications. Cyber threats do not respect national 
boundaries, and many critical systems are globally interconnected. As 
such, our approach to protecting SIEs must include international 
cooperation and alignment of cybersecurity standards and practices.
    Identifying and protecting SIEs represent an essential evolution in 
our national cybersecurity strategy. By focusing our resources and 
efforts on these key nodes within our critical infrastructure, we can 
more effectively mitigate the risk of catastrophic cyber incidents. 
However, as mentioned, this approach demands both a reimagining of 
public-private partnerships and a commitment to continuous adaptation 
in the face of evolving threats.
               rethinking the public-private partnership
    As we confront the evolving landscape of cyber threats to our 
critical infrastructure, it is imperative that we fundamentally 
reimagine and deepen our approach to public-private partnerships in 
cybersecurity. While valuable, the traditional model of more 
information sharing is no longer sufficient to address the 
sophisticated and persistent threats we face today.
    We must acknowledge a stark reality: no company, regardless of size 
or sector, entered the market expecting to defend itself against the 
significant strength of foreign military and intelligence services. 
Yet, this is precisely the challenge our critical infrastructure 
operators now face. This asymmetry demands a new paradigm of 
collaboration between Government and industry.
    The Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC), established by the 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), represents a 
positive step toward more integrated cooperation.\19\ It's worth noting 
that the concept of such a collaborative effort was initially 
recommended by the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, which led to the 
creation of the Joint Cyber Planning Office (JCPO) through the fiscal 
year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act.\20\

Commission--NDAA Press Release,'' December 3, 2020, https://

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    JCDC, evolving from the JCPO concept, is an operational entity that 
brings together public and private-sector partners to enhance the 
Nation's cyber defenses. JCDC is exceptionally effective at rallying 
stakeholders around specific crises, such as the Log4j vulnerability. 
But, there is also an opportunity to enhance day-to-day collaboration 
and information sharing to further strengthen the collective 
cybersecurity posture between crises. It's important to recognize that 
JCDC is still in its early stages and has limitations. It currently 
involves a relatively small number of members, and there's a clear need 
to scale this model as we confront increasingly complex and wide-spread 
threats.
    While JCDC provides a framework for collaboration, more is needed 
to address the full spectrum of cybersecurity challenges we face. To 
genuinely have trust and operationalize these partnerships, we need to 
develop sector-specific approaches that can address different 
industries' unique challenges and needs.
    One promising example of a sector-specific approach is Project 
Fortress, recently launched by the U.S. Department of Treasury. This 
initiative aims to enhance cybersecurity in the financial sector by 
moving beyond a purely defensive posture to a more proactive defense 
model that includes offensive capabilities.\21\ By creating automated 
intelligence-sharing pipelines between the U.S. Government and the 
financial sector, Project Fortress demonstrates the potential for 
deeper, more dynamic public-private collaboration.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As we consider expanding such models to other critical 
infrastructure sectors, we must be mindful of small and medium-sized 
businesses' unique challenges. These enterprises form the backbone of 
our economy but often lack the resources to participate fully in 
sophisticated cybersecurity partnerships. We must develop scalable 
solutions that allow these smaller entities to benefit from and 
contribute to our collective defense.
    To truly turbocharge our public-private partnerships, we should 
consider establishing collaborative environments that go beyond 
information sharing to include joint threat hunting, coordinated 
incident response, and shared defensive operations. These environments 
could leverage Government and industry partners' unique capabilities 
and perspectives, creating a force multiplier effect against 
sophisticated adversaries.
    Furthermore, we must explore innovative models for risk-sharing 
between the public and private sectors. This could include new 
insurance frameworks, government backstops for catastrophic cyber 
incidents, and incentives for companies that adopt enhanced security 
measures and participate in collaborative defense efforts.
    As we develop these sector-specific approaches, it's important to 
note that improved harmonization across regulatory and reporting 
frameworks can help all these efforts while supporting our posture. 
Harmonization is also particularly important for small and medium-sized 
businesses, which often lack the resources to navigate complex 
regulatory structures. Harmonizing will help reduce redundancy and 
organizational burden while supporting a more effective cybersecurity 
posture. We cannot afford a check-the-box or lowest-common-denominator 
harmonization solution. Our approach must be dynamic and focused on 
continuous improvement rather than merely meeting minimum standards.
    As we move forward, it is crucial to recognize that this reimagined 
partnership is not about shifting all responsibility to the Government. 
Instead, it is about creating an ecosystem where public and private-
sector strengths are synergistically combined to enhance national cyber 
resilience. This approach requires transparency, trust-building, and 
continuous adaptation as the threat landscape evolves.
                      insurance and cybersecurity
    The cyber insurance market has experienced significant growth in 
recent years,\22\ with global premiums reaching approximately $20 
billion by 2025.\23\ However, this figure belies the true extent of 
organizations' cyber risk exposure.\24\ The current state of the market 
is characterized by underinsurance, with many businesses lacking 
adequate coverage for the full spectrum of cyber threats they face.\25\

supported a Federal framework to address catastrophic cyber risks. At

(FIO) and NYU's Volatility and Risk Institute, several insurance 
executives expressed the need for Government involvement in managing 
systemic cyber risks.\28\ However, others in the industry caution 
against premature Government intervention, arguing that the market is 
still evolving and growing.\29\

    The insurance sector has responded to the challenges posed by 
nation-state threats and potential systemic risks by introducing 
exclusions for war, nation-state actions, and attacks on critical 
infrastructure.\30\ While these exclusions protect insurers' balance 
sheets, they leave a significant gap in coverage for the most severe 
cyber incidents, potentially shifting the burden to policy holders or, 
ultimately, to the Government in the event of a catastrophic attack.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Despite these challenges, the insurance industry is crucial in 
promoting better cybersecurity practices. Insurers can encourage 
organizations to implement more robust security controls and improve 
cyber hygiene through underwriting requirements and pricing incentives. 
This market-driven approach should significantly enhance the 
cybersecurity posture of businesses across various sectors.
    However, market forces alone are insufficient to address the full 
spectrum of cyber risks, particularly those posed by nation-state 
actors. The potential for a catastrophic cyber event that could 
overwhelm private-sector capabilities necessitates considering the 
Government's role in cyber risk management.
    One potential solution is developing a cyber insurance framework 
similar to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act.\31\ Such a program could 
position the Government as an insurer of last resort for catastrophic 
cyber attacks, providing a backstop for the private insurance market 
and ensuring that critical infrastructure operators have access to 
coverage for even the most severe incidents.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    It's important to note that any Government intervention should be 
carefully designed to complement private-sector efforts rather than 
replace them. A well-structured program could help grow market capacity 
and provide stability while still incentivizing businesses to invest in 
robust cybersecurity measures.
    A pilot project could be initiated, focusing on a specific critical 
infrastructure sector such as energy and power utilities. This pilot 
could involve collaboration with existing mutual insurance 
organizations like AEGIS, which already has significant experience in 
insuring utility companies.\32\ By starting with a targeted approach, 
we can assess the effectiveness of a public-private insurance model and 
refine it before considering broader applications.

    Creating a robust cyber insurance system also presents a strong 
business case for enhanced cybersecurity. By setting clear standards 
for insurance sector involvement and coverage, we can incentivize 
organizations to improve their security practices. This approach 
leverages market forces to drive better cybersecurity outcomes, with 
the Government providing support where private-sector solutions fall 
short.
    It's crucial to strike the right balance between Government 
intervention and private-sector innovation. While a Federal backstop 
can provide necessary security for catastrophic risks, we must be 
careful not to stifle growth and innovation in the private sector, 
encompassing services, technology, and the cyber insurance market. The 
truth is that innovation shouldn't be stifled in the name of security. 
The goal should be to create an environment where private companies can 
continue to develop new products, services, and technologies while 
insurers expand coverage. Government support should focus on addressing 
systemic risks that exceed market capacity, particularly in areas of 
catastrophic attacks, without impeding the natural evolution and 
improvement of private-sector solutions.
    As we consider these potential solutions, we must also work to 
address the unique challenges small and medium-sized businesses face. 
These organizations, which form the backbone of our economy, often lack 
the resources to invest heavily in cybersecurity or purchase 
comprehensive cyber insurance. Any Federal program should consider how 
to extend protection and incentives to these smaller entities through 
targeted initiatives or support for industry-specific insurance pools.
                               conclusion
    The cyber threat landscape facing our Nation has reached a level 
that demands a fundamental reimagining of our approach to 
cybersecurity. As I have shared throughout this testimony, our 
challenges are multifaceted and evolving, requiring a collaborative 
response from both the public and private sectors.
    Identifying and protecting Systemically Important Entities (SIEs) 
represents a crucial step forward in our national cybersecurity 
strategy. By focusing our efforts on these key nodes within our 
critical infrastructure, we can more effectively mitigate the risk of 
catastrophic cyber incidents that could have far-reaching consequences 
for our national security, economic stability, and public safety.
    However, the designation of SIEs is just the beginning. We must 
deepen and turbocharge our public-private partnerships to create a more 
resilient cybersecurity ecosystem. This reimagined collaboration should 
go beyond traditional information sharing to include joint threat 
hunting, coordinated incident response, and shared defensive 
operations. Initiatives like Project Fortress in the financial sector 
provide a promising model for this enhanced cooperation.
    The role of the insurance sector in this new paradigm cannot be 
overstated. While market forces and private insurance have driven 
significant improvements in cybersecurity practices, the limitations of 
the current cyber insurance market's ability to address nation-state 
threats and potentially catastrophic events is clear. We must seriously 
consider the development of a Federal insurance response to 
catastrophic cyber incidents similar to the model provided by the 
Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. The time to deliberate and think this 
through is now, not after a catastrophic incident occurs, rather than 
scrambling to develop solutions in the aftermath. By proactively 
considering these issues, we can better prepare our Nation's cyber 
systems to withstand catastrophic incidents.
    However, any Government intervention must be carefully calibrated 
to complement rather than replace private-sector efforts. A well-
designed Federal backstop could help grow market capacity and provide 
stability while still incentivizing businesses to invest in robust 
cybersecurity measures. The proposed pilot project focusing on the 
energy sector could serve as a valuable testing ground for this 
approach.
    As we move forward, we must remain mindful of the needs of small 
and medium-sized businesses, ensuring that our strategies for enhancing 
cybersecurity and cyber insurance are scalable and accessible to 
organizations of all sizes.
    In conclusion, today's cyber threats require a bold, collaborative, 
and adaptive response. By reimagining our public-private partnerships, 
leveraging the power of the insurance sector, and providing targeted 
Government support where necessary, we can build a more resilient and 
secure digital infrastructure for our Nation.
    We must also recognize that this is not a one-time effort. As 
highlighted in the recently-released National Cyber Director's Posture 
Report, the cybersecurity landscape is constantly evolving.\34\ We must 
be prepared to consistently recalibrate our approaches, learn from our 
experiences, improve our strategies, and adapt to new threats as they 
emerge.

Posture Report.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Our efforts to strengthen national cybersecurity should be seen as 
an on-going and interactive improvement process. We must move beyond 
simply reacting to cyber threats and adopt a more proactive, forward-
looking stance. This includes developing effective cyber deterrence 
strategies tailored to different adversaries, as the tactics that work 
against one nation-state may differ from those needed to counter others 
or cyber criminal groups.
    The time for action is now, but our commitment must be enduring. We 
must seize this opportunity to strengthen our collective defense 
against today's cyber threats while remaining vigilant and adaptable to 
better protect our economic and national security in the face of 
tomorrow's challenges.

STATEMENT OF MATTHEW MC CABE, MANAGING DIRECTOR, CYBER BROKING, 
                  GUY CARPENTER & COMPANY, LLC

    Mr. McCabe. Chairman Garbarino, Ranking Member Swalwell, 
and Congressman Luttrell, thank you very much. My name is 
Matthew McCabe. I'm a managing director and cyber reinsurance 
broker at Marsh McLennan. Marsh McLennan is a leading 
professional services firm advising clients across 130 
countries. We help these clients navigate complex challenges 
through 4 market-leading businesses: Marsh, Guy Carpenter, 
Mercer, and Oliver Wyman. These challenges include developing 
cyber risk strategies for clients of all sizes and across all 
sectors of industry. Often, this involves measuring exposure to 
cybersecurity incidents and the placement of cyber insurance, 
or reinsurance. Marsh McLennan introduced some of the very 
first insurance policies that address data privacy and cyber 
risk.
    My comments today focus on cyber threats to critical 
infrastructure and the roles that industry and Government can 
play in building cyber resilience against catastrophic attacks. 
The cyber threat to critical infrastructure is undeniable. We 
referenced the Volt Typhoon attack and in the joint 
cybersecurity advisory about that threat. The agencies warned 
that nation-state threat actors were prepositioning themselves 
already on IT networks to enable lateral movement and to 
disrupt functions. Just last year, the FBI tallied 193 
complaints of ransomware from companies that operate critical 
infrastructure.
    Critical infrastructure companies encounter this threat 
every day. Increasingly, cyber insurance serves as an essential 
component for mitigating that risk. First, the underwriting of 
insurance serves as an annual assessment of security by an 
objective third party, and that assessment receives scoring in 
economic terms through either premiums or terms of coverage.
    Second, cyber insurers use risk engineering to monitor the 
level of cyber hygiene maintained by their insured.
    Third, cyber insurance provides incident response planning 
services. These expert services empower organizations to 
navigate through ransomware events, data breaches, and other 
cyber incidents. This aspect is especially valuable to 
thousands of small- and mid-sized businesses that have 
encountered cyber incidents.
    Last, cyber insurance fulfills the critical role of helping 
organizations manage capital through the transfer of financial 
risk.
    For these reasons, insurance is increasingly--is an 
increasingly vital component of cyber risk management, although 
uptake varies by company size. Forty-seven percent of Marsh 
clients with annual revenues greater than $1 billion purchase 
cyber insurance. That compares with 34 percent of clients with 
annual revenues of less than $1 billion.
    However, there are some cyber events, whether carried out 
by a nation-state or a criminal threat actor, that could 
disrupt U.S. infrastructure so severely that the insurance 
industry cannot accept the magnitude of the losses. Such an 
event could have global economic impact and overwhelm insurers. 
It is difficult to quantify the delta between the ceiling for a 
catastrophic cyber event and the current limits of cyber 
insurance.
    The Global Federation of Insurance Associations estimates 
that this protection gap may be as high as $900 billion. There 
are now discussions regarding the potential benefit of a 
public/private partnership for catastrophic cyber risk, where 
the Government would become the reinsurer of last resort if a 
cyber event resulted in losses deemed too large for the 
insurance industry to absorb.
    Last year's National Cybersecurity Strategy recognized when 
catastrophic cyber incidents occur, it is Government's 
responsibility to stabilize the economy and provide certainty 
in uncertain times. Structuring that response before a 
catastrophic event occurs rather than rushing to develop an aid 
package after the fact could provide certainty to markets and 
make the Nation more resilient. Federal support has precedent 
with other risks such as nuclear, terrorism, and flood.
    This committee should also consider a targeted option that 
takes a sector-specific approach, such as the energy sector--
the committee could examine which sectors of critical 
infrastructure have the greatest need for a Federal backstop. 
If we start preparing now, we can bend the risk curve for 
catastrophic cyber events. Insurance creates the right economic 
incentives to drive changes in society. Analyzing this issue 
now and leveraging the benefits of risk management will help 
build a more resilient U.S. economy.
    I appreciate the opportunity to share our perspective on 
cyber threat and how insurance works to mitigate that risk and 
enhance resilience, and look forward to your questions.

    Marsh McLennan is the world's leading professional services firm in 
the areas of risk, strategy, and people. Our more than 85,000 
colleagues advise clients in 130 countries. We work with corporate and 
public-sector clients to navigate complex challenges through 4 market-

    These challenges include developing strategies for clients of all 
sizes and across all of industry to mitigate cyber risk. Marsh McLennan 
introduced some of the very first insurance policies that addressed 
data privacy and cybersecurity risks, and we remain leaders in that 
business today.
    We appreciate the opportunity to share our perspective on the cyber 
threat to critical infrastructure, how cyber insurance works to 
mitigate that risk and enhance resilience, and potential Government 
solutions that harness the mechanism of cyber insurance.
                           executive summary
    The responsibility for building cyber resilience in the 
infrastructure sector is shared among its owners, the insurance 
industry, and Government.
Cyber threats to critical infrastructure
    There is an on-going threat of cyber attack against U.S. critical 
infrastructure--financial institutions, communications providers, 
health care, energy, transportation, and water utilities 
infrastructure--including from activity sponsored by nation-states and 
others.
  <bullet> The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) received 
        nearly 1,200 complaints in 2023 from the critical 
        infrastructure sector regarding ransomware attacks, a 
        persistent and growing threat across all industries.
  <bullet> In 2023, Marsh McLennan received more insurance claims 
        related to ransomware than in any prior year.
Cyber insurance helps build organizational resilience
    Over time, insurance has proven effective at turning potentially 
ruinous risks into manageable components--whether it's responding to 
natural catastrophes, cyber attacks, or the broad range of other risks.
  <bullet> Cyber risk ranks among the top threats facing companies 
        today, requiring vigilance and continuous monitoring in order 
        to build resilience.
  <bullet> Cyber insurance is a critical tool in managing the financial 
        risk associated with cyber risk.
  <bullet> Insurance underwriting contributes to organizational 
        readiness for cyber attacks by, among other benefits, acting as 
        an annual assessment of cyber risk preparedness.
  <bullet> Marsh McLennan's Cyber Risk Intelligence Center provides 
        data-driven analyses to help companies identify where to invest 
        in effective cyber risk management.
The cyber insurance protection gap
    The potential damage to U.S. critical infrastructure from an attack 
or other major event has the potential to produce financial losses 
beyond the insurance industry's ability to accept. The cyber protection 
gap is difficult to quantify; some estimates put the global gap as high 
as $900 billion.
Establishing a public-private partnership
    There is increasing discussion regarding the role a public-private 
partnership (PPP) might play in managing the cyber risk protection gap. 
Doing so would not be without precedent as other risks--including 
nuclear, terrorism, and flood--have established PPPs.
                cyber threats to critical infrastructure
    There is a clear and present cyber threat against the U.S. 
companies that own and operate critical infrastructure. U.S. officials 
acknowledged the threat in a recent Joint Cybersecurity Advisory that 
warned operators of critical infrastructure that nation-state cyber 
threat actors had already compromised their cyber defenses and were 
``pre-positioning themselves on IT networks to enable lateral movement 
to [operational technology] assets to disrupt functions.'' The report, 
whose authors included the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security 
Agency (CISA), the FBI and the National Security Agency (NSA), noted 
that nation-state cyber threat actors targeted multiple critical 
infrastructure organizations--in areas including health care, 
communications providers, energy, transportation, and water utilities--
throughout the United States and its territories.
    In its annual report on industrial controls systems, the 
cybersecurity company Dragos found that ransomware remains the No. 1 
cyber threat. Dragos observed 50 active ransomware groups impacting 
industrial organizations in 2023 and tracked 905 reported ransomware 
incidents impacting industrial organizations in 2023.
    Also in 2023, the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) 
received 1,193 complaints from organizations belonging to critical 
infrastructure sectors that were affected by a ransomware attack. 
Although ransomware represented less than 20 percent of claims reported 
to Marsh in the United States in 2023, the number of Marsh clients 
reporting cyber extortion events in 2023 was the highest annual level 
to date. It remains a top concern for our clients given its increased 
frequency, sophistication, and potential severity.
    On a positive note, the percentage of companies paying ransom 
demands continued to decline, signaling that organizations are growing 
more resilient to ransomware threats.

    In some instances, cyber operations against critical infrastructure 
threaten cyber physical systems, where there is the potential for 
kinetic consequences including machinery breakdown, pipeline leakage, 
train derailment, and disruption of the global supply chain. Today, the 
risk of disrupting cyber physical systems has grown more acute through 
the internet of things (IoT), which connects cyber physical systems to 
the internet, as well as the increasing standardization of technologies 
that makes industrial control systems more easily recognizable to 
adversaries.
          cyber insurance helps organizations build resilience
    Industry and Government face an unrelenting barrage of cyber 
threats. As a result, cyber risk ranks as one of the leading challenges 
facing organizations today, as seen in analyses such as is found in the 
annual Global Risks Report from the World Economic Forum, to which 
Marsh McLennan is a key contributor. Despite the resources invested, 
cybersecurity remains a dynamic and evolving risk that requires 
continuous management in order to build organizational resilience.
    Cyber insurance has become an essential component of cyber risk 
management, as it fulfills the critical role of helping organizations 
manage capital through the transfer of financial risk for potential 
cyber incidents. Cyber insurance can also play a key role in bolstering 
cyber resilience.
    Underwriting for cyber insurance serves as an annual assessment of 
an organization's cyber hygiene. Those insureds that do not demonstrate 
effective technology, practices, and procedures to mitigate cyber risk 
typically will receive ``feedback'' in the form of higher policy 
premiums and/or less favorable terms and conditions. Cyber insurance 
underwriting has grown increasingly demanding as insurers seek a fuller 
understanding of their potential exposures and how individual risks 
might aggregate and impact their overall portfolios.
    Marsh McLennan has established the Cyber Risk Intelligence Center, 
which provides leading solutions for cyber analytics and modelling. For 
example, the center has undertaken focused research on the 
prioritization of cyber risk controls. Its research evaluated controls 
including endpoint detection and response (EDR), multifactor 
authentication (MFA), and privileged access management (PAM) and 
provided a weighted scoping for each control's effectiveness, which can 
help businesses decide where to prioritize their cybersecurity 
investments.

    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    Cyber insurance supports many vital aspects of cybersecurity. For 
example, cyber insurers typically provide risk engineering services to 
insureds, and some will provide active threat detection monitoring. 
Cyber insurance has also introduced incident response planning services 
to thousands of companies. This aspect is especially valuable for small 
and mid-size businesses. Insurers have helped these organizations 
navigate through numerous ransomware events and data breaches. Last, 
the financial risk transfer provided by insurance will support 
companies in their recovery from cyber events.
    For these reasons, insurance is an increasingly vital component of 
cyber risk management, although uptake varies by company size--47 
percent of Marsh clients with annual revenues greater than $1 billion 
purchase cyber insurance, compared to 34 percent of clients with annual 
revenues below $1 billion.
                   the cyber insurance protection gap
    The potential impact from some cyber events--whether due to an 
attack by a nation-state or other cause--could disable and disrupt some 
of the most critical U.S. infrastructure to such an extent and at such 
a cost that the insurance industry alone could not accept the risk. By 
definition, such an event could have a global economic impact and 
overwhelm the cyber insurance marketplace, individual insurers, and 
others.
    It is difficult to quantify the delta between the ceiling for a 
catastrophic cyber event and the current limits of insurance coverage, 
but the Global Federation of Insurance Associations estimates that this 
protection gap may be as high as $900 billion. Such gaps primarily 
represent two categories: underinsured losses and uninsurable losses.
    Underinsured losses.--Global cyber insurance premium today is 
approximately $15 billion, which is roughly 3 times the size of the 
cyber insurance market 5 years ago. In comparison, Marsh McLennan 
projects a catastrophic global event loss at the once-in-200 years 
level would range between $15.6 billion and $33.4 billion. These 
figures indicate that the cyber insurance market remains in an early 
stage, with insurers carefully managing limits to avoid large losses 
from catastrophic cyber events. As a result, large organizations with 
significant risks may struggle to purchase sufficient limits to offset 
their potential exposure.
    Uninsurable losses.--Like other insurance lines, cyber coverage 
will exclude events that could result in large losses that cannot be 
easily modeled. The most prominent examples of this are exclusions for 
failure of critical infrastructure and losses arising from cyber 
operations supporting acts of war or hostilities. If a large cyber 
event meets the thresholds of these exclusions, then losses would be 
fully borne by the insured.
    a public-private partnership to address the cyber protection gap
    There are now discussions regarding the potential benefits of a 
public-private partnership (PPP) for catastrophic cyber risk, where the 
Government would become the reinsurer of last resort if a cyber event 
resulted in losses deemed too large for the insurance industry to 
absorb. Such a partnership would reduce the cyber protection gap and 
incentivize providers of capital to share in the risk because it would 
limit the ceiling of exposure.
    A Federal framework to address catastrophic cyber risk would 
respond to a gap in a manner that could only be fulfilled by the U.S. 
Government. As last year's National Cybersecurity Strategy recognized: 
``When catastrophic incidents occur, it is a Government responsibility 
to stabilize the economy and provide certainty in uncertain times . . . 
Structuring that response before a catastrophic event occurs--rather 
than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact--could provide 
certainty to markets and make the Nation more resilient.''
    Precedent exists for the Government to undertake this role. Current 
risk-sharing mechanisms include the Price Anderson Act of 1957 for 
providers of nuclear power; the National Flood Insurance Program 
(NFIP); and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIP), established 
following the attacks of September 11, 2001. The establishment of a 
Federal framework to address the cyber coverage gap would be a natural 
evolution of the Government's role. Without discussion and planning 
today about the Government's role in a catastrophic cyber event, there 
would, in all likelihood, be a period of confusion to determine how to 
meet the need when such a crisis occurs. Therefore, we believe the time 
is now to have that conversation.
                               conclusion
    We appreciate the Homeland Security Committee dedicating a hearing 
to this important matter, and we encourage the committee to hear from 
critical infrastructure owners and operators to better understand their 
cyber risk.
    If we start preparing now, we can bend the risk curve for 
catastrophic cyber events. Insurance creates the right economic 
incentives to drive change in society. Analyzing this issue now, and 
leveraging the benefits of risk management, will help to build a more 
resilient U.S. economy.

           ransomware: a persistent challenge in cyber claims
    Understanding cyber claims trends helps to inform an effective risk 
management strategy for one of the signature risks in today's tech-
driven society.
    Analysis of the 1,800+ cyber claims submitted to Marsh in the 
United States and Canada in 2023 reveals the following:
  <bullet> 21 percent of clients that purchased a cyber policy reported 
        an event in 2023, consistent with the percentage over the past 
        5 years.
  <bullet> In 2023, events were driven by factors including increased 
        sophistication of cyber attacks; the MOVEit event, highlighting 
        supply chain vulnerabilities; and privacy claims.
  <bullet> Health care, communications, retail/wholesale, financial 
        institutions, and education remain in the top 5 of most 
        affected industry sectors.
  <bullet> Ransomware represented less than 20 percent of claims 
        reported, but remained a top concern for organizations given 
        their increased frequency, sophistication, and potential 
        severity.
  <bullet> In managing claims, it's important to follow proper 
        procedures, including notifying insurers, brokers, and other 
        stakeholders and maintaining proper documentation.
  <bullet> Organizations' cyber resilience strategy should incorporate 
        a view of cyber risk across the enterprise, including its 
        potential economic and operational impact and taking account of 
        cybersecurity at vendors and other third parties.
                solving the cyber risk financial dilemma
    The average cost of a data breach globally was US$4.45 million in 
2023, increasing by 15 percent over a 3-year period. The average cost 
of a data breach in the United States was more than double, at US$9.48 
million.
    Today's digital-dependent world consists of unrelenting cyber 
threats. At the same time, macroeconomic conditions may place senior 
leaders under enormous pressure to reduce risk while managing 
constricted budgets. This can lead to senior leaders considering 
whether to invest in cybersecurity controls or purchase cyber coverage.
    Instead of an either-or choice, organizations should strike a 
balance through a two-pronged approach to financially prudent cyber 
resiliency. This consists of investing in cybersecurity controls while 
purchasing insurance that aligns with risk tolerance to cover losses 
following a potential cyber incident.
    To help make objective, informed decisions, senior leaders should 
consider the following questions.
  <bullet> What are my contractual requirements?
  <bullet> How much would a cyber incident cost my organization?
  <bullet> What does cyber insurance cover?
  <bullet> How much does cyber insurance cost?
  <bullet> Is the cyber insurance application too time-consuming?
                  public-private partnership examples
Significant loss events or changes in how risks are modeled can lead to 
        market-wide capacity withdrawal.
    TRIA was passed in 2002 following a wide-spread withdrawal of 
commercial terrorism cover by reinsurers after the September 11, 2001, 
terrorist attacks.
    Flood Re was developed to provide affordable flood risk cover to 
the approximately 3 percent of UK homeowners living in high flood risk 
areas. Industry-wide improvements in flood risk modeling had made 
coverage unaffordable for this cohort.
Extreme risks typically require some form of Government backstop.
    Government treasuries are the insurer of last resort on multiple 
loss-sharing schemes. For example, the U.S. National Flood Insurance 
Program (NFIP), the UK's Pool Re, and France's CCR Cat Nat and Gestion 
de l'Asurance et de la Reassurance des risques Attentats et actes de 
Terrorisme (GAREAT) have unlimited guarantees. TRIA, the Australian 
Reinsurance Pool Corporation (ARPC), Germany's Extremus, and the 
Netherlands' Nederlandse Herverzekeringsmaatschappi/ voor 
Terrorismeschaden (NHT) have limited guarantees.
Public-private partnerships provide credibility and can be structured 
        to gradually shift risk to the private sector.
    The U.S. Government's terrorism backstop enabled insurers to access 
affordable reinsurance for terrorism coverage. Over time, Federal 
reinsurance participation in the program has fallen from 90 percent in 
2002 to 80 percent in 2020, while insurer deductibles have risen from 7 
percent of premium in 2002 to 20 percent in 2020. Insurer retentions 
have also increased, from $5 million in 2002 to $200 million in 2020.
    The U.K. government's backing of Pool Re similarly enabled insurers 
to access affordable terrorism reinsurance. Over time, the Pool Re fund 
grew and private reinsurer confidence was restored, to the point that 
<brit-pound>2.4 billion of reinsurance cover is now purchased. As a 
result, a loss fund of approximately <brit-pound>10 billion (including 
member retentions) sits between the consumer and the government needing 
to step in.
Programs can be used to incentivize the adoption of preventive 
        measures.
    Eligibility for the U.S. flood risk program, NFIP, requires 
communities to adopt and enforce strict floodplain ordinances and 
offers premium discounts for outstanding performance.
    While there is no direct requirement for risk mitigation by Pool Re 
stakeholders, premium discounts of up to 7.5 percent are available for 
insureds that proactively undertake such initiatives.
    The U.S. crop insurance industry supports continued agronomic 
research to determine how farmers can best incorporate risk management 
best practices in their operations and the impact those practices may 
have on insured crops.
    The US SAFETY Act of 2002 was created to spur the adoption of 
improved security measures by offering to limit liability of companies 
providing anti-terrorism products and services for qualified vendors. 
Similar policies, coupled with a robust public-private insurance 
market, could incentivize private-sector adoption of prophylactic 
measures to drive down exposures.
    Flood Re is intended as a temporary solution to be phased out by 
2039. As such, the Government has committed to major investments in 
preventive measures, while Flood Re has prompted insurers to work to 
enhance their understanding, mapping, and modeling of flood risk and 
their collection of data for improved underwriting.

    Mr. Garbarino. Thank you, Mr. McCabe.
    I now recognize Ms. Denbow for 5 minutes to summarize her 
opening statement.

  STATEMENT OF KIMBERLY DENBOW, VICE PRESIDENT, SECURITY AND 
              OPERATIONS, AMERICAN GAS ASSOCIATION

    Ms. Denbow. Hello? How's that?
    Mr. Garbarino. Wonderful.
    Ms. Denbow. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Garbarino, 
Ranking Member Swalwell, and Congressman Luttrell. I'm Kimberly 
Denbow, vice president of security and operations at the 
American Gas Association, AGA. AGA represents more than 200 
local energy companies that deliver clean and affordable 
natural gas to 96 percent of natural gas customers in the 
United States. I have led AGA's security policy and technical 
program for nearly 3 decades.
    Of particular interest here, I authored comments on behalf 
of AGA in response to the Federal Insurance Office's potential 
Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents. 
Thank you for inviting me here today, to this hearing to share 
the natural gas utility perspective.
    Safety and security are core values for America's natural 
gas utilities, which are countering the cyber threat daily 
through a diverse portfolio of tools that include cybersecurity 
insurance, a variety of cybersecurity enhancement and 
information-sharing programs, natural gas system, operational 
resilience, and public/private partnership opportunities.
    With respect to cyber insurance and from the natural gas 
utilities experience, the number of insurance providers willing 
to write cyber insurance policies has been limited. While 
capacity appears to be improving, actuarial data in the 
industry continues to be in short supply, and is limiting the 
scope of coverage. The terms of exclusions vary widely and are 
difficult for many operators, particularly smaller ones, to 
understand what is covered and where important limiting 
coverage terms are in policy definitions. Owner/operators would 
benefit from standardized cyber insurance policy language, 
definitions, and applications that are simpler and more 
streamlined. Further, AGA members support a Federal backstop 
for cyber insurance.
    AGA members continually work with Federal Government 
partners and regulators to promote risk-based cybersecurity 
programs that support attainable, sustainable, and auditable 
security measures. On the regulatory front, this is best 
represented by our work with the Transportation Security 
Administration, TSA. TSA continues to coordinate with pipeline 
owner/operators to improve risk-based cybersecurity 
requirements and achieve predetermined cybersecurity outcomes, 
all the while promoting flexibility to strengthen and add value 
to the pipeline's security directives.
    On the voluntary front, the pipeline effort of the Joint 
Cyber Defense Collaborative, JCDC, is an exemplary model of 
convening diverse communities of government, natural gas 
pipeline owner/operators, and industrial control system vendors 
to solve the tougher pipeline sector cybersecurity challenges.
    Before I close, I would be remiss if I did not draw your 
attention to a leading topic that continues to impair trust 
between owners and operators and our Government. This topic is 
sensitive information protection. This is best depicted by the 
recent CISA chemical security assessment tool cybersecurity 
breach and the failure--the failure--of the Federal Government 
to protect owner/operator sensitive operational information. We 
are talking about security and operational resilience; in this 
case, the Government dropped the ball.
    There must be Government accountability in the collection, 
aggregation, and protection of critical infrastructure 
sensitive operational information. It is insufficient for 
agencies to express regret while operators are left to bear the 
brunt of the consequences.
    In closing, AGA member utilities combat the evolving cyber 
threat daily by leveraging a diverse cybersecurity management 
portfolio. Cyber insurance stakeholders benefit from 
standardized cyber insurance policy language, definitions, and 
applications. AGA encourages the Government to learn from the 
successes of TSA and the JCDC in their genuine collaboration 
with owner/operators. Last, the Federal Government should hold 
itself to comparable, if not higher, standards for the 
protection of aggregated sensitive critical infrastructure 
information.
    Thank you for this opportunity to testify. I look forward 
to the exchange.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    AGA, founded in 1918, represents more than 200 local energy 
companies that deliver clean, domestic, and reliable natural gas 
throughout the United States. There are more than 77 million 
residential, commercial, and industrial natural gas customers in the 
United States, of which 96 percent--more than 74 million customers--
receive their gas from AGA members. Today, natural gas meets more than 
one-third of our Nation's energy needs. AGA members recognize that with 
the benefits and opportunities natural gas offers our country, there 
comes great responsibility to protect our distribution pipeline system 
network from cyber compromise.
    Technological advances continue to make natural gas operations 
safer, more cost-effective, and better able to serve customers via web-
based programs and tools. The corollary to a more connected and more 
efficient industry is our attractiveness as a target for increasingly 
sophisticated cyber actors. This said, America's natural gas utilities 
are combatting the threat daily via:
  <bullet> skilled personnel,
  <bullet> robust cybersecurity system protections,
  <bullet> an industry commitment to security,
  <bullet> collaboration with other industries and associations,
  <bullet> on-going cybersecurity partnerships with the Federal 
        Government, and
  <bullet> interaction with the Downstream Natural Gas Information 
        Sharing & Analysis Center (DNG-ISAC) Community for real-time 
        awareness and action.
  safety and security--core values for america's natural gas utilities
    AGA and its member companies are committed to investing in leading 
security technologies, utilizing best practices and training, and 
promoting an industry-wide security culture of vigilance to help 
fortify our security defenses and enhance all aspects of safety. To 
that end, the following provides an overview of AGA member natural gas 
utility experiences with cyber insurance, natural gas utility 
cybersecurity and operational resilience, and opportunities to build on 
existing public/private partnerships.
Cyber Insurance and Natural Gas Utilities
            Insurance Coverage Availability & Effectiveness
    In the gas utility sector's experience, the number of insurance 
providers willing to write cyber insurance policies has been limited. 
While capacity appears to be improving, the relatively unpredictable 
scale and cost of a successful cybersecurity compromise of critical 
operations unsurprisingly has limited the scope of coverage. Actuarial 
data in the industry continues to be in short supply and may be 
ineffective as a predictor given the rapid changes in cyber threats. As 
a result, some existing cyber insurance programs are unnecessarily 
restrictive in terms of coverage.
    For example, gaps in insurance coverage resulting from cyber 
incidents leave an owner/operator uncovered when a cyber event results 
in physical impacts. Such impacts generally do not fall under the cyber 
policy, and while they may be pieced together under a property policy 
or through a specialty product designed to bridge this gap, this is a 
disincentive to an owner/operator obtaining cyber insurance.
    Another common issue is most insurance policies limit or eliminate 
coverage if the cyber attack is conducted as part of an ``act of war'' 
or carried out by nation-states or their affiliates. The terms of these 
exclusions vary widely and are difficult for our owners/operators to 
evaluate. Some versions of these exclusions may place the owner/
operator in the position of not only having to demonstrate the impact 
of the cyber incident but also to identify the origin and motive of the 
adversary--the latter action is beyond the practical scope of natural 
gas utility cybersecurity programs and sometimes even beyond the 
capability of our Federal partners.
    These issues are indicative of an overall need for simpler, more 
streamlined cyber policy terms and the applications required to 
purchase such insurance. It is difficult for many operators, 
particularly smaller ones, to understand what is actually covered under 
cyber insurance policies where important limiting coverage terms are 
often buried in places like policy definitions.
            Federal Backstop
    AGA members plan for potential disruptions caused by successful 
cyber incidents on their systems and services and may procure insurance 
to offset associated potential financial losses. Given that a 
disruption of energy systems can lead to significant economic impact, 
AGA members have a vested interest in ensuring that a healthy cyber 
insurance market exists, including one that can adequately offset so-
called ``catastrophic'' losses.\2\ An appropriately structured Federal 
backstop is needed to stabilize the cyber insurance market. It would 
cap potential losses and allow insurers to assess and quantify risks 
without the fear of a devastating loss event.\3\ Additionally, it could 
help address persistent cybersecurity shortfalls if the Federal 
backstop is made contingent on the standardization of insurance cyber 
policy language/definitions and applications. An owner/operator 
adherence to cybersecurity best practices that are risk-based \4\ or 
regulatorily prescriptive may further help advance security.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ AGA comments to Federal Insurance Office (FIO) ``Potential 
Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents'' as 
published in the Federal Register on September 29, 2022, at 87 FR 59161 
et seq.
    \3\ Axio comments to FIO ``Potential Federal Insurance Response to 
Catastrophic Cyber Incidents'' as published in the Federal Register on 
September 29, 2022, at 87 FR 59161 et seq.
    \4\ Policies consistent with risk-based security measures could 
include encouraging companies to adopt defense-in-depth strategies, 
least-privilege access security model, and/or controls supporting the 
NIST Cyber Security Framework key functions of govern, identify, 
detect, protect, respond, and recover.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Creating a Federal backstop for the cyber insurance market is 
proactive, practical, and cost-effective way to protect consumers and 
manage growing cyber risks.
            ``Safe Harbor'' Statutes
    Federal ``safe harbor'' statutes encourage companies to take 
forward-leaning cybersecurity measures to bolster their own 
cybersecurity as well as the cybersecurity of their peers. Two relevant 
examples that could be woven into any catastrophic-type cyber insurance 
program would be the DHS SAFETY Act program as well as the cyber threat 
information sharing programs established in the Cybersecurity 
Information Sharing Act of 2015 (``CISA 2015'').
                SAFETY Act
    The program offers companies the ability to minimize or even 
eliminate specific types of tort liability following cyber attacks when 
companies can demonstrate they have implemented robust and effective 
security programs. Linking the obtainment and maintenance of SAFETY Act 
protections to cyber insurance would be highly useful in promoting 
effective cybersecurity as well as limiting the economic losses 
associated with catastrophic cyber attacks.
    Linking the SAFETY Act to any catastrophic cyber insurance program 
could offer companies that have received a SAFETY Act award--and thus 
have demonstrated that they offer a cybersecurity technology program 
effective in deterring, defeating, responding to, or mitigating cyber 
attacks--a specific path to receiving expanded catastrophic cyber 
attack coverage and/or more favorable premiums.
                CISA 2015
    Congress sought to promote greater sharing of threat information 
amongst companies and with their partners within DHS. Participation in 
information-sharing programs (e.g., the DNG-ISAC) helps break down 
barriers to effective threat intelligence analysis. Moreover, active 
participation in public-private cyber information-sharing regimes and/
or ISACs should be considered part of any possible requirement for 
owners/operators to obtain access to any future Federal cybersecurity 
insurance backstop.
Natural Gas Cybersecurity and Operational Resilience
            Cybersecurity
    AGA members have been at the forefront of cybersecurity investment 
and are continually seeking ways to raise their cybersecurity 
readiness. The AGA Board of Directors passed a resolution in 2021 in 
favor of reasonable cybersecurity regulations, and AGA and its members 
engage in every opportunity to work with Federal Government partners 
and regulators to promote risk-based cybersecurity programs that 
support security measures that are attainable, sustainable, and 
auditable. This includes extensive work with the Transportation 
Security Administration (TSA) to help strengthen and add value to the 
pipeline Security Directives (SDs)\5\ and reduce risk for the industry. 
Overall, risk-based cybersecurity aligns with the National Security 
Memorandum on Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience.\6\

    \5\ Security Directive Pipeline 2021-01 (May 28): Enhancing 
Pipeline Cybersecurity (SD1), and Security Directive Pipeline 2021-02 
(July 19): Pipeline Cybersecurity Mitigation Actions, Contingency 
Planning, and Testing (SD2). The SD's have been reissued annually since 
2021. Per TSA Administrator David Pekoske, the SDs will continue to be 
reissued until cybersecurity regulations are promulgated.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    AGA member natural gas utilities engage in a variety of 
cybersecurity enhancement programs, including, but not limited to:
  <bullet> AGA cybersecurity peer-to-peer program, in which operators 
        evaluate their respective company cyber policies, procedures, 
        and practices.
  <bullet> AGA Biennial Cyber Metrics Survey, which helps benchmark 
        cybersecurity maturity across the natural gas utility 
        community.
  <bullet> Natural Gas Exercise (NGX), which is a national tabletop 
        exercise of physical security, cybersecurity, and business 
        continuity. NGX-2024 will be a hybrid exercise intended to 
        drill operators' cyber incident response plans and ``test'' 
        provisions within the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, which 
        have been suggested by the Department of Energy to permit the 
        Federal Government to redirect natural gas from transmission 
        pipelines in times of emergency without regard to contractual 
        agreements.
  <bullet> Network monitoring technology, which tracks network traffic 
        for unusual cyber activity.
  <bullet> The DNG-ISAC (stood up by AGA and its members over a decade 
        ago), which provides the natural gas industry \7\ with a secure 
        platform for the trusted exchange of physical and cyber threat 
        information and analytics. Given the interdependence between 
        the natural gas and the electric subsectors, there is also a 
        great deal of coordination with the Electric Information 
        Sharing & Analysis Center.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ Members of the DNG-ISAC include AGA member natural gas 
utilities, transmission pipeline members of the InterState Natural Gas 
Association of America, and utility and transmission members of the 
Canadian Gas Association. Additionally, governmental members include 
Fusion Centers, DHS Intelligence & Analysis, select State threat 
offices and law enforcement groups.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <bullet> Energy Sector Cyber Mutual Assistance Program administered 
        by the Edison Electric Institute.
    It should be noted that while the threat landscape can appear 
similar across most critical infrastructure sectors, natural gas 
utility operations are increasingly needing to address new (and 
unintentional) cybersecurity risks introduced by Federal and State 
government actions intended to address pipeline safety. For example, 
because Federal pipeline safety policies now mandate the installation 
of remotely-operated valves, natural gas cyber professionals must now 
plan accordingly to address new cyber vulnerabilities associated with 
this new electronic equipment. Further, as State regulators evaluate 
requiring operators to make detailed pipeline operations information 
publicly available, consideration must be given to the potential 
increased risk of adversaries leveraging such information to 
strategically disrupt natural gas systems.
            Operational Resilience
    The operational characteristics of the natural gas transportation 
network in combination with the physical properties of natural gas 
effectively minimize the likelihood and severity of wide-spread service 
disruptions.
  <bullet> Operators manage the internal pressure of the delivery 
        system by controlling the amount of natural gas that enters and 
        leaves the system; this process of increasing and decreasing 
        pressure happens relatively slowly because of the 
        compressibility of natural gas. Industrial control systems are 
        used to help monitor and, in some cases, operate the pipelines 
        and their components that move the gas.
  <bullet> Critical electronics generally have mechanical fail-safes 
        and can be operated manually, if necessary.
  <bullet> Natural gas physically moves slowly through a pipeline at an 
        average speed of 15-20 miles per hour, further allowing time 
        for pipeline operators to manage the flow and adjust operations 
        in the unlikely event of a disruption. Outages are rare, and 
        when they occur, they tend to be localized due to the 
        interconnected nature of the transportation network.
  <bullet> Few pipelines in the United States are single-sourced and 
        those that are single-sourced have back-up supply contingency 
        plans, which may include utilizing underground natural gas 
        storage, liquified natural gas, and/or other mechanisms to 
        support system resilience.
    enhanced public/private partnerships: improving regulations and 
                        strengthening engagement
    AGA and its member utilities engage actively in public/private 
partnership opportunities that add measurable value, while also 
advancing cybersecurity. These opportunities include direct 
participation with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which has 
several cybersecurity-related initiatives and programs across its 
portfolio of agencies that regulatorily or voluntarily affect natural 
gas utilities. DHS entities of particular relevance to natural gas 
utilities include the:
  <bullet> TSA,
  <bullet> Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)--
        specifically, the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards 
        (CFATS) and the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) 
        Pipelines Cyber Defense Planning Effort, and
  <bullet> United States Coast Guard.
    Each entity/program has helped in varying degrees to move the 
needle on natural gas utility cybersecurity. For example,
  <bullet> On the regulatory front, TSA continues to coordinate with 
        pipeline owners/operators to improve risk-based cybersecurity 
        requirements and achieve predetermined cybersecurity outcomes 
        while promoting flexibility. Despite the challenges associated 
        with the first generation of pipeline Security Directives (SDs) 
        in 2021, the credibility established between TSA and owner/
        operators prior to the issuance of the SDs helped promote the 
        improvements to subsequent SDs. Particularly noteworthy, TSA's 
        leadership regularly hosts Inspection Forums to garner feedback 
        from owners/operators regarding ways to strengthen the SDs and 
        ensuing cyber regulations.
  <bullet> On the voluntary front, the JCDC Pipeline Effort continues 
        to lead an interactive community of government, oil & natural 
        gas pipeline owner-operators, and industrial control system 
        vendors--all driving toward a shared common goal of robust 
        pipeline sector cybersecurity. The inaugural product of this 
        collaboration was a Pipeline Reference Architecture tool and 
        accompanying principles to serve as a voluntary model to guide 
        cybersecurity investment, planning, and operations as pipeline 
        operators work to better segment their networks and mitigate 
        intrusion campaigns.
    While cybersecurity regulation harmonization and zero trust 
reporting appear to be the latest concepts of choice across the Federal 
Government, Government action (and inaction) can hinder their 
implementation. The Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical 
Infrastructure Act's (CIRCIA) Proposed Reporting Requirements and the 
recent CISA Chemical Security Assessment Tool (CSAT) cybersecurity 
breach are indicative of the challenges that Government must resolve in 
order to be a reliable industry partner. The challenges are described 
as follows.
            Harmonization
    While the CIRCIA proposed reporting requirements speak of 
harmonization between the Federal agencies, CISA does not have the 
authority to require cross-agency harmonization. As a result, the 
burden is on the owners/operators to determine gaps between agency 
cybersecurity authorities. For a natural gas utility that operates 
natural gas, electric, water, coastal facilities, and nuclear, the 
operator must sort through cyber incident reporting requirements of 
TSA, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, the 
Environmental Protection Agency, the USCG, and the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission. It is incumbent on CISA to ensure that its overall 
cybersecurity reporting requirements account for and harmonize with 
similar cybersecurity reporting schemes required by sector-specific 
Federal agencies as much as possible in order to improve efficiency and 
reduce costs to the covered entities.
            Zero Trust
    While the Federal Government is driving itself to a zero trust \8\ 
approach, the Government's collection and aggregation of security and 
operational-related information from critical infrastructure to meet 
security requirements prevent critical infrastructure owners/operators 
from achieving zero trust. This is evidenced by the recent DHS CISA 
cyber incident in which the Chemical Security Assessment Tool (CSAT), 
which contains industry reporters' detailed security vulnerabilities 
and plans,\9\ had been compromised for multiple days before being 
recognized by CISA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\ Zero Trust Architecture/GSA.
    \9\ Top-Screen Surveys, Security Vulnerability Assessments, Site 
Security Plans/Alternative Security Programs, Personnel Surety Program 
Data, and CSAT User Information.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Given the significant implications of the CSAT breach, it is 
imperative to address the necessity for Government accountability in 
the collection, aggregation, and protection of sensitive operations 
information. The inadequate cybersecurity measures that resulted in the 
breach underscore the need for the Government to have stringent 
safeguards and robust incident response protocols on the systems the 
Government relies on to store critical infrastructure information. 
Furthermore, the lack of communication from the responsible agencies 
exacerbated the situation, leaving operators without crucial 
information to effectively mitigate the damage. It is not sufficient 
for agencies to express regret; there must be a concerted effort to 
prevent recurrence and ensure operators are not left to bear the brunt 
of the consequences. Effective oversight and enhanced security 
frameworks on the Government's own networks are essential to restore 
public confidence and protect national security interests.
    Ensuring the proper security and handling of sensitive operational 
information submitted by industry to Government partners supports 
mutually beneficial collaboration. AGA and its member companies value 
Government partnership, while also seeking to limit the vulnerabilities 
introduced by demonstrated Government cybersecurity performance.
                               in closing
    America's natural gas utilities recognize their attractiveness as a 
vector and target for nefarious cyber actors. AGA member utilities 
combat the threat daily by leveraging a cybersecurity management 
portfolio of wide-ranging tools to include cybersecurity insurance, 
risk-based cybersecurity measures, participation in the DNG-ISAC, and 
active engagement in value-add public/private initiatives that advance 
cybersecurity.
    AGA encourages the Government to learn from the successes of TSA 
and JCDC in their genuine collaboration with owners/operators--to 
earnestly work with the owners/operators to seek solutions that are 
risk-based, outcome-focused, and elevates security above compliance to 
achieve a commonly-shared mission. Additionally, harmonization of 
Government-imposed cybersecurity requirements should not be the burden 
of owners/operators but rather the responsibility of the Government 
agencies. Last, the Federal Government should hold itself to sensitive 
information security standards and incident reporting at least as high 
as required of owners/operators. This is particularly significant given 
the Government's aggregation of our Nation's most critical 
infrastructure operational information.

    Mr. Garbarino. Thank you, Ms. Denbow.
    I now recognize Mr. Kudale for 5 minutes to summarize his 
opening statement.

   STATEMENT OF JACK KUDALE, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, COWBELL

    Mr. Kudale. Chairman Garbarino, Ranking Member Swalwell, 
and Congressman Luttrell, thank you for the opportunity to 
testify today on cyber resiliency in the case of a major cyber 
event.
    In 2019, I founded Cowbell, a cyber insurance provider 
using artificial intelligence headquartered in Pleasanton, 
California. Over the last 5 years, Cowbell has scaled from a 
small InsurTech to a leading provider of cyber insurance for 
small- and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs. While we are first 
and foremost a cyber insurer, we take an active role in helping 
our policy holders decrease their cyber risk exposure by 
sharing our cybersecurity tools and expertise with them. Our 
continuous risk assessment of both our policy holders and the 
aggregate SME market provides us with best-in-class 
understanding and knowledge to mitigate and prevent potential 
loss.
    SMEs are one of the most underserved segments of the 
American economy when it comes to cybersecurity and cyber 
insurance. Any meaningful discussion surrounding the security 
of our critical infrastructure requires an understanding of the 
SME ecosystem. This segment represents over 99 percent of all 
businesses, 40 percent of the American GDP, and a potential 
major propagator of a wide-spread cyber contagion.
    SMEs also have the most to gain from basic cybersecurity 
majors. They hold the potential to either aggregate or 
extinguish a cyber catastrophe at scale via the most simple 
types of exploitations or software and hardware updates. Now, 
this is due to both the size and level of digital connectivity 
of the average SME. Unsophisticated types of vulnerabilities 
can aggregate simply due to a lack of basic awareness and 
security. Furthermore, an attack on an unsophisticated market 
poses indirect threats to every entity in the cyber ecosystem.
    Currently, 4 out of 5 SMEs in the United States are either 
uninsured or underinsured when it comes to cyber insurance. 
Awareness, education, and standardization of cybersecurity 
hygiene are still lacking, most often in the small business 
segment, and particularly, in the uninsured market.
    Additionally, awareness without sufficient guidance does 
not lead to appropriate action. In 2022, a survey on small 
business cybersecurity trends highlighted that 51 percent of 
small businesses did not have any cybersecurity measures in 
place, and that 59 percent of those businesses considered 
themselves too small to be targeted.
    Cowbell teams have found notable differences in the 
cybersecurity hygiene of the average uninsured or first-time 
buyer of insurance to that of the insured market. Now, this 
poses a compounding aggregation potential. The most uninsured 
entities are the most overexposed. It also outlines a broader 
truth regarding insurance gaps. Those with the least to lose 
stand to lose the most in the event of a cyber catastrophic 
event.
    Now, market growth projections for the SME cyber have not 
kept pace with the larger corporations. Now, this is outlined 
by the World Economic Forum Cybersecurity Outlook, 
demonstrating that while more high-revenue companies are 
maturing into leaders of cyber resilience, more low-revenue 
organizations are losing overall cyber resiliency than gaining 
it.
    Overall, Cowbell and cyber insurance providers alike have 
unique visibility into the downstream impact of cyber incidents 
where cyber meets financial, human, and physical consequences. 
Cowbell especially gained such visibility when working with 
secondary victims of supply chain attacks, which are increasing 
in number and seek to damage an organization and its customers 
through the single breach of one entity.
    I thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I look 
forward to your questions and our continued conversation.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Kudale follows:]
                   Prepared Statement of Jack Kudale
                             June 27, 2024
                            i. introduction
    Chairman Garbarino, Ranking Member Swalwell, and Members of the 
committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today on cyber 
resiliency in the event of a major cyber event.
    In 2019, I founded and launched Cowbell, a cyber insurance 
provider, powered by artificial intelligence, headquartered in the 
United States. Over the last 5 years, Cowbell has scaled from a small 
InsurTech to a leading provider of cyber insurance for small and 
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). While we are first and foremost a 
cyber insurer, we take an active role in helping our policy holders 
decrease their cyber risk exposure by sharing our cybersecurity tools 
and expertise with them. Our continuous risk assessment of both our 
policy holders and the aggregate SME market equips our risks with best-
in-class understanding and knowledge to mitigate and prevent potential 
loss. We employ nearly 165 people, including data scientists, software 
engineers, and cybersecurity and insurance industry professionals, who 
research the overall cybersecurity posture of the comprehensive SME 
ecosystem of risks.
    The Cowbell team has supported cyber insurance and data initiatives 
for the U.S. Government since 2020. We actively participate in public-
private partnerships, such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Agency's (CISA) Cyber Infrastructure and Data Working Group (CIDAWG), 
through which we have worked over the past months with select industry 
partners to address concerns over data governance standards. We have 
engaged in on-going discussions regarding the possibility of a 
Government Cyber Insurance Program through the Treasury's Federal 
Insurance Office (FIO) and the Office of the National Cybersecurity 
Director (ONCDE) and we continue to be an outspoken voice in the field 
of SME cybersecurity risk and insurance. Cowbell is deeply committed to 
educating, securing, and insuring the cyber risk of small and medium-
sized enterprises.
                  ii. smes as core cybersecurity risk
    SMEs are one of the most underserved segments of the American 
economy when it comes to cybersecurity and cyber insurance. Any 
meaningful discussion surrounding the security of our critical 
infrastructure requires an understanding of the SME ecosystem. This 
segment represents over 99 percent of all businesses, 44 percent of the 
American GDP, and a potential major propagator of a wide-spread cyber 
contagion.
    SMEs have the most to gain from basic cybersecurity measures; they 
hold the potential to either aggregate or extinguish a cyber 
catastrophe at scale via the most simple types of exploitations or 
software and hardware updates respectively. This is due to both the 
size and level of digital connectivity of the average SME. 
Unsophisticated types of vulnerabilities can aggregate simply due to a 
lack of basic awareness and security. Furthermore, an attack on an 
unsophisticated market poses indirect threats to every entity in the 
cyber ecosystem.
    According to a World Economic Forum study,\1\ 41 percent of all 
companies surveyed have been affected by a third-party cyber incident 
with small and medium-sized suppliers being increasingly targeted to 
later hack into their larger customers' systems. The expected rise in 
costs incurred by businesses globally due to software supply chain 
attacks is estimated to grow from US$46 billion in 2023 to US$60 
billion in 2025.\2\

cost-of-software-supply/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The SME web of interconnected entities is critical to American 
economic stability. Moreover, it is perfectly positioned to form a core 
component of loss prevention if equipped with the appropriate tools for 
cyber risk.
                  iii. cyber insurers as risk managers
    Currently, the SME cybersecurity posture is widely varied. 
Understanding for a moment that the average company in the United 
States has revenues of less than $5 million, they can be forgiven for 
overlooking cybersecurity as core to their business. Nearly 4 out of 5 
SMEs in the United States are either uninsured or underinsured when it 
comes to cyber insurance.
    Awareness, education, and standardization of cybersecurity hygiene 
are still lacking, most often in the small business segment. 
Additionally, awareness without sufficient guidance does not lead to 
appropriate action. A 2022 survey on small business cybersecurity 
trends highlighted that 51 percent of small businesses did not have any 
cybersecurity measures in place and that 59 percent of these businesses 
considered themselves too small to be targeted.\3\

51-of-small-business-admit-to-leaving-customer-data-unsecure/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Cyber insurance providers such as ourselves are quickly becoming 
the most significant force in educating SME policy holders on basic 
cybersecurity. The degree to which these risks can change is key to 
their insurability. The risk profile of cyber insurance shoppers can be 
improved instantly through tech-enabled underwriting and purchasing 
processes.
                    iv. insured vs uninsured market
    Leveraging information from our risk pool, Cowbell teams have found 
notable differences in the cybersecurity hygiene of the average 
uninsured or first-time buyer of insurance vs the insured market. This 
poses a potentially compounding aggregation potential; the most 
uninsured entities are most overexposed. It also outlines a broader 
truth regarding insurance gaps: those with the least to lose stand to 
lose the most in the event of a cyber event.
    Under these conditions, an increase in market penetration to the 
SME cyber insurance market pays dividends to the security of the 
overall cyber ecosystem. This is because every entity that is taught 
appropriate cyber hygiene is a break in the chain when it comes to 
cyber contagion and a reduction in aggregation potential for everyone. 
It is also what is most commonly missed in discussions about the size 
of the aggregate cyber exposure: every additional dollar of market 
coverage is insuring a diminished amount of systemic risk.
    With 80 percent of the SME market still uninsured and overexposed, 
these entities need to understand that cyber risk is business risk, and 
SME risk is a cyber aggregation risk.
         v. understanding the downstream impact of cyber events
    Cowbell and cyber insurance providers have unique visibility into 
the downstream impact of cyber incidents, where cyber meets financial, 
human, and physical consequences. Cowbell especially gains such 
visibility when working with secondary victims of supply chain attacks.
    Supply chain attacks seek to damage an organization and its 
customers through a single breach of one entity. Since 2021, the number 
of U.S. entities affected by supply chain attacks has increased year 
over year. In 2021 521 U.S. organizations reported impact due to a 
supply chain attack.\1\ In 2022 this figure tripled to 1,543 and 
increased again in 2023 to 2,769. Research from Gartner predicts that 
by 2025 45 percent of all organizations will have experienced 
operational impact due to a software supply chain attack.\2\
    Visibility into the downstream impact of cyber events can allow 
cyber insurers to understand:
  <bullet> Incident types
  <bullet> Nature of impact
  <bullet> Amount of losses
  <bullet> Types of losses
  <bullet> Types of damages
  <bullet> Downtime
  <bullet> Recovery time
  <bullet> Impacted policy holders' size, sector, location
  <bullet> Relationship between impacted policy holders and breached 
        organization
  <bullet> If impacted policy holders had a backup vendor
  <bullet> If impacted policy holders had a business continuity plan
  <bullet> If there was lateral movement from the breached organization 
        on to the systems of impacted policy holders
  <bullet> Amount of policy holder data held by the breached entity.
            vi. current state of the cyber insurance market
    The global cyber insurance market has reached a size of US$14 
billionn in 2023 and is estimated to increase to around US$29 billion 
by 2027.\4\ Showing significant growth potential, the market is driven 
by the awareness of the increasing frequency and sophistication of 
cyber attacks, including the potential financial repercussions, as well 
as by stricter State and national regulatory requirements. Further 
growth factors continue to be the on-going digital transformation and 
technological advances in all sectors and concrete requirements to be 
satisfied by business partners within the supply chain. This overall 
trend illustrates the importance of cyber insurance as a core component 
of cyber risk management. However, large companies still account for 
the majority of premiums; small and medium-sized enterprises bear most 
of their cyber risks on their own.

    Market growth projections for the SME cyber market have not kept 
pace with the larger corporations. This is outlined by the WEF 
Cybersecurity Outlook, demonstrating that while more high-revenue 
companies are maturing into leaders in cyber resilience, more low-
revenue organizations are losing overall cyber resiliency rather than 
gaining it.\5\

        vii. smes, cyber insurance, and critical infrastructure
    Cowbell is committed to protecting and advocating for the 
underserved, underrepresented market that is the SME market. SMEs are 
the backbone of the U.S. economy and if they are vulnerable, the 
national economy and all entities associated with critical 
infrastructure are vulnerable. In the case of a systemic risk that 
would lead to a catastrophic event, a significant percentage of the SME 
market is extremely vulnerable.

technology \6\--Cowbell Factors--comparing major industries' aggregate 
cyber risk postures to each other.

    Today's hearing should serve as an urgent call to collective action 
for our valued SMEs. Specifically:
    1. Classification of SMEs as a subset of any cyber preparedness 
        measures
    2. Increased calls for the SME ecosystem, particularly entities 
        that remain uninsured, to become cyber-resilient
    3. Harmonization of SME cybersecurity and data governance best 
        practices.
    Cyber insurers have constructed a viable framework for cyber 
resilience. However, the limitations to both penetration and total 
risk-bearing market capacity merit special attention. The damage from 
catastrophic events could either exceed or fall squarely outside of the 
scope of the current insured market. Insurers, particularly those in 
the SME space, face a major challenge in closing this gap between 
economic and insured losses. Given the dynamic growth of risks in a 
digital world, higher insurance penetration for cyber risks is the 
ultimate goal. In securing our most valuable SMEs from the digital 
threats they face, we can collectively offer increased resiliency to 
the economy and society.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, I look forward to 
your questions and our continued discussion.

    Mr. Garbarino. Thank you, Mr. Kudale.
    Members will be recognized by order of seniority for their 
5 minutes of questioning. Additional round of questioning may 
be called after all Members have been recognized.
    To start, I'm going to recognize the gentleman from Texas, 
Mr. Luttrell, for 5 minutes of questioning.
    Mr. Luttrell. Ms. Denbow, in your opening remarks, if I 
picked up correctly, you blamed--the U.S. Government is at 
fault for--can you elaborate or expand on that statement just 
so I know exactly where we're sitting today?
    Ms. Denbow. Yes, sir. So the Department of Homeland 
Security Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards is 
implemented by, at this point, CISA, the Cybersecurity 
Infrastructure Security Agency. When CFATS, the Chemical 
Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards, was first released, those 
companies that held large quantities of chemicals, which were 
considered chemicals of interest, appendix A, had to submit top 
screen analyses, and in addition to that, security 
vulnerability assessments, as well as other sensitive 
information about their operations, chemical quantities, where 
they're located, how they are used, and whatnot.
    The database that contains that information was breached 
last year and--in so many ways. Other than the fact that it was 
very disturbing that owner/operators learned about that breach 
months later through the media, rather than through the 
Government, we recently were informed that though there has 
been no demonstration or evidence that information was 
exfiltrated from the database, that the database was accessed 
for 3 days, which means that there is every opportunity that 
screen shots or other ways that information, sensitive 
operational information of our chemicals from across the United 
States were accessible.
    So, this is where I say the Government is trying very hard 
to get a better handle on what needs to be secured. I will 
say--let me step back and say, the CFATS program has been 
phenomenal. They have done a great job in improving our 
Nation's chemical security. But this goes to the part of 
protecting the sensitive information, and it seems every 
Government entity and the sister entities all want to have 
access to operations sensitive information for one form or 
another, and thought needs to be given to how that is going to 
be protected. There needs to be a transparency with the owner/
operator of the information if that information is compromised 
in any way.
    Mr. Luttrell. Communication is always a huge deal when 
you're dealing with siloed entities. Case in point, SMEs across 
the board are very closed off. I think the ability for us to 
operate between the seams, if you will, in order to communicate 
properly, if we had an attack, or sharing information back and 
forth with each other on, Hey, this is the inevitable result of 
the attack, don't let this happen to you, is, I think, 
something that we're inevitably working on daily around here.
    Everybody is so close-hold with their daily information, 
whether or not it's retrospective, prospective, aggregated, 
where it lives and breathes. I'll never vouch for--well, maybe 
I'll be careful how I'll say this. I don't think anybody is 
completely protected from any sort of attack whatsoever where 
we sit today, but thank you for clarification on that.
    The--so sector-specific data or cyber insurance, and I'm 
going to toss this one out to the bunch, anyone grab a hold of 
it if you want to--if we want a public/private and a Government 
relationship and the Government to come in and back fill when 
necessary, if necessary, what does that look like? Because when 
we're talking about cybersecurity and cyber space, inevitably, 
a cyber attack can be a grid hit, it can be an agricultural 
hit, or it can--you know, inevitably it can be life or death.
    So how--on this committee, how do we--we're on the 
receiving end of this. We're all ears here, OK, because you're 
the subject-matter experts. But if we're going to play this 
out--and believe me, I've got to pay insurance bills all the 
time. But it's very laid out specifically on, Hey, here's what 
it is and here's how we're going to do this. But we--in the 
metaverse, in the cyber space, risk and threat changes every 
half second of every second of every minute of every hour of 
every day. What--how do we build the proper foundation and move 
forward, so we, on this committee and the House, can understand 
that and then provide the support needed? I'm tossing that out 
to the group.
    Mr. McCabe. Sure. I'm happy to jump on that. So it's got to 
be done collaboratively with industry. There is a lot of 
different elements to it. No. 1, you know, industry doesn't 
speak with one voice. There's going to be all sorts of 
insurance voices and opinions given on it. I think that there's 
going to be some very crucial elements, like for the cyber 
incident, that it shouldn't have a requirement of attribution 
by the Federal Government, so it's too hard.
    I think it should be determined by impact, and that's the 
overall size of the loss. I think that that impact is going to 
either be set on a percentage level of, you know, losses of 300 
percent of an insurer's book or of perhaps a fixed dollar 
number, but that's going to be a conversation back and forth.
    We submitted a response to an RFI where we threw out, you 
know, a suggested number where negotiations could begin, and we 
put it around the 1- and 250-year event--when I say ``we,'' I 
mean my company, Marsh McLennan--put it around the overall 
impact of the 100- and 250-year event to just show the 
magnitude that would have to be for the Federal backstop to 
kick in.
    I think it should be voluntary, because I don't think that 
every insurance company is necessarily going to want to 
participate, and that's a key distinction from TRIA, that TRIA 
responded to a very specific problem, and we're talking about, 
you know, building resilience here proactively, and I think 
that, you know, it shouldn't be compulsory to force companies 
into it, but I think there's a lot of interest out there.
    My last point I think I would address is that trying to do 
the entire industry at one time might be just too big of a bit 
to chew, so I would approach sector-specifics. I think the 
energy sector is a perfect one where you have a very cohesive 
sector that interact with one another who are already very 
highly regulated.
    Mr. Luttrell. If we do start with that--and I'm sorry, Mr. 
Chairman, for going over--if we do start with that in the 
energy sector--I'm not going to say I disagree or agree with 
you--remember, we represent 800,000 people with hundreds of 
thousands of companies across the Nation, there's going to be 
somebody that's going to argue with that statement.
    Mr. McCabe. That's----
    Mr. Luttrell. So imagine on the receiving end up here, who 
we--we've got to wade through all this. So it's going to be the 
collective group coming together for a stepping-off point. But 
I'm sorry to close you off, sir.
    Mr. McCabe. Yeah.
    Mr. Garbarino. I'm 2 minutes over, Mr. Chairman. I 
apologize.
    Mr. Garbarino. That's fine.
    Mr. Luttrell. Thank you, sir.
    Mr. Garbarino. The gentleman yields back.
    I now recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Swalwell, for 5 
minutes of questioning.
    Mr. Swalwell. Mr. Luttrell, do you want some time?
    Mr. Luttrell. Do you mind, sir? Yeah, no, OK.
    Yeah, please, sir, you continue with your closing, your 
thought.
    Mr. McCabe. I would just say, for those sectors that are 
going to come back and say I don't understand why they're 
first, I would say, are welcome at the table. I'm just naming a 
sector that I think it particularly fits for. But if financial 
institutions come forward and say, That's as important it is 
for us that it is for them, by all means those discussions----
    Mr. Luttrell. This is where the--and I hate to say the 
masses, but this is where the independent agencies and 
companies are going to have to come together and really 
position themselves in order to address the Government on the 
way forward. I may be speaking out of turn here, but if you 
just could kind-of play out everything that happens in the 
Continental United States that we're talking about here, which 
every single--I mean, think about it. Everybody has an iPhone 
in their pocket. Everything is digital today. Everything is 
touched by the cyber space. So if we're going--if this is 
something that we really want to expand on--which we do, we 
wouldn't be having that hearing if it otherwise--we just--
you're going to have to help us.
    Mr. McCabe. We are here to help.
    Mr. Luttrell. OK. Thank you, Ranking Member.
    Mr. Swalwell. Yeah.
    Mr. Garbarino. Mr. Swalwell.
    Mr. Swalwell. Mr. Kudale, in your testimony you observed 
that 80 percent of small- and medium-sized businesses lack 
cyber insurance and are overexposed, and that 59 percent of 
small businesses consider themselves too small to be targeted. 
Startling statistics that you cited for us.
    But at the same time, I understand that small businesses 
may find implementing baseline cybersecurity controls too 
expensive and may be overwhelmed navigating the cyber insurance 
market, particularly if we don't get this SEC rule right on, 
like, what the reporting is, that could also bog them down. 
What more should the Government be doing to educate small 
businesses about cyber risks and incentivize implementation of 
baseline cybersecurity controls?
    Mr. Kudale. Ranking Member Swalwell, thank you for the 
question. First and foremost, just us being here, this is a 
big--great step. This hearing itself is a big event for us to 
express and educate the general public about what's happening 
in cyber insurance market.
    Second, in my written testimony I recommended a 3-step 
process when it comes to SMEs, small- and medium-sized 
enterprises. I'll just read out the first one out of my written 
testimony, and that's classification of SMEs as a subset of any 
cyber preparedness measures, right. Too often, the focus is all 
on large enterprises and corporations, and so, this is the 
second thing we can do.
    Third, education is the most critical when it comes to SME 
market and cybersecurity, right. All it takes is one individual 
to make their organization successful by not clicking on some 
random link. All it takes is one person to take that entire 
organization down. It is a business-ending event for small 
businesses. So cybersecurity awareness training is where most 
of the focus is for SMEs and a public/private partnership.
    If I have to point my finger on one thing, is the 
cybersecurity awareness training incentives--Government, 
private universities, whatever it takes, right--being able to 
educate those 33.5 million businesses that is 44 percent of our 
Nation's GDP. It is mission-critical for us to focus on 
education regarding cybersecurity.
    Mr. Swalwell. Mr. Kudale, is the Government doing enough to 
work with insurers to help standardize policy coverage and 
terminology? Should we standardize coverage and terminology, or 
as Mr. Luttrell alluded to, do we need to be mindful of kind-of 
the sector-by-sector, industry-by-industry, critical 
infrastructure versus noncritical infrastructure type of 
complexity there?
    Mr. Kudale. We do. Yes, it's not a straightforward yes-or-
no answer. Cyber is a very technical--it's the emerging 
technical risk. It's unlike any other insurance line. In fact, 
it's the only other line outside of life insurance that's 
organically growing. In every other insurance line, you are to 
replace another insurance policy. Being nature, it's an 
evolving risk, coverage has to be innovative, you know. Over 
the last 10 years, the terminology in coverage have been 
evolving, and we're still not there, OK.
    So by putting limitation and standardization, it might hurt 
how nimble we are. Our purchasers really like a custom coverage 
that insurance companies put together for their needs, 
especially when there are new threats that are evolving every 
second, every hour, every day, right.
    At the same time, there are areas where we would love to 
see some standardization, war, war-related exclusions. That is 
what ITs exist in the marketplace today. So there are certain 
areas we can improve on standardization, but this is an 
emerging technical risk. We got it, you know, in this market 
and coverage's terminology plays a very important role until 
the time it matures. Four out of 5 small businesses do not have 
cyber insurance. That is 80 percent market you just mentioned 
as well. That's a tough one if there is--to achieve that type 
of standardization in the current time, present time.
    Mr. Swalwell. I think when you were referencing life 
insurance and the comparison, were you saying that every other 
type of insurance is essentially compulsory, that you have to 
purchase it like legally, auto insurance or homeowners 
insurance, or depending on what sector you work in, like, you 
know, malpractice insurance, but it's cyber and life are the 
only 2 that are not required?
    Mr. Kudale. That's correct. That's exactly what I meant. As 
in every other line of insurance, there is a mandate. There is 
a requirement. There is an obligation. Not so much in cyber 
insurance. Yes, there are places, large corporations that are 
mandating their supply chain partners. Government contracts are 
mandating their contractors to have cyber insurance policy, but 
there is no uniform mandate for cyber insurance like an auto 
policy or a home insurance.
    Mr. Swalwell. OK. Thank you again, Mr. Kudale. I'll yield 
back.
    Mr. Garbarino. The gentleman yields back.
    I now recognize the gentlelady from Florida, Ms. Lee, for 5 
minutes of questioning.
    Ms. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Cilluffo, I'd like to start with you, please. In your 
written testimony, you stressed the importance of identifying 
and protecting systemically-important entities. You said you 
would like to see this coordination go beyond information 
sharing and see entities engage in joint threat analysis and 
incident response coordination. What do you think, if any, are 
the inhibiters to entities engaging in these kinds of 
activities and getting beyond that information-sharing stage?
    Mr. Cilluffo. Thank you, Ms. Lee, and that's an excellent 
question. I think, just like any other environment, trust 
really is the coin of the realm. It takes a very long time to 
build, and it can evaporate in a nanosecond with one silly 
comment, or one leak or what have you. So I think it really 
does come down to trust, and also being honest enough to know 
where one's strengths are and where one's weaknesses are.
    So I make the case that the information sharing sets of 
discussions--they're all important, but they're tired. Maybe 
I'm just old and grumpy--I've been at this issue a long time--
but I kind-of feel like we have to go beyond all of that. The 
only way you really go beyond that is if you play ball together 
and you're actually going to start hunting together, you're 
actually going to feel the pain together, and you're actually 
going to respond together.
    So I think, to me, that's where we need to go. All that 
said and done, trust is still going to be--you don't want to 
necessarily--if you're a company and you have intellectual 
property, or if you have PII data that could be leaked in one 
way or another, obviously that comes with consequences. So you 
want to make sure that you minimize those to the greatest 
extent possible.
    Ms. Lee. Do you have any thoughts on how we might do that, 
anything that you would recommend or think we should be 
considering in how we could build that trust?
    Mr. Cilluffo. Yeah. I think the JCDC is a starting point, 
the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative out of CISA. I think it 
needs to be scaled. The good thing about JCDC, if there's a 
crisis, they come together well. So when something is going 
boom in the middle of the night, or might go boom tomorrow, 
they are able to galvanize and rally the troops. The problem is 
that doesn't have sustainability in a day-to-day environment, 
so we've got to figure out how to be able to transcend some of 
that.
    In my testimony, I touched on Project Fortress, which is a 
new initiative. It's led by Department of Treasury financial 
services sector. Then they have--they have publicly stated that 
there's not--it's not only going to be a reactive defensive set 
of issues, but you can turn to other tools that Treasury has, 
such as OFAC and where they can start looking at unique ways to 
be able to put some pain on some of our adversaries. Because, 
quite honestly, we're never going to defend our way out of this 
problem. We are going to have this same discussion in 10 years 
if that's all we do.
    Ms. Lee. Ms. Denbow, you mentioned both in your written 
testimony and in your earlier discussion with Mr. Luttrell 
CFATS program. So I know on this subcommittee we're very 
committed to trying to get that legislation passed, but right 
now, since it has not, I'd like to hear a little bit more from 
you. First, let's start with, what are the benefits of the 
program, and what do you find to be useful about it?
    Ms. Denbow. Well, I will tell you that the program sets a 
foundation for operators to work from, and one of the biggest 
values of the program--when the program first came out, I was 
around when the program first came out, and it was a very 
different model than what it is now. It has actually migrated 
to a model that is extremely functional, where we talked about 
trust; trust cannot be mandated; trust must be earned, and that 
requires an investment of resources on both sides, the operator 
and the Government partner or the Government regulator 
regardless. That's how we in the pipeline--with the pipelines 
are achieving what we're achieving with TSA. It's that trust.
    So, I will tell you that through the Chemical Facility 
Anti-Terrorism Standards program, they have been able to help 
operators learn what can they do to maybe minimize or reduce 
the amount of quantities they have on-site, or to substitute 
for that, but more importantly, to provide the securities in 
place, the physical securities in place to protect, detect, and 
mitigate. I think--and specifically--and, yes, we do want 
reauthorization. We've been pushing for that for a long time, 
so go, reauthorization of that.
    At the same time, this is a black eye to that program that 
there was this cybersecurity breach, but the breach should not 
be looked at just as an issue of that program. It is a systemic 
issue across the Government, because it's not just that group 
that got hit and has been successfully compromised.
    One thing I wanted to mention to something you mentioned 
earlier, information sharing versus incident reporting. There 
is a difference between the two, and you will get more 
engagement from operators if they are invited to engage in 
information sharing versus incident reporting. That actually, 
with some cyber policies, triggers negative points for the 
insured if they are incident reporting versus just information 
sharing. That comes from myself, who leads the Downstream 
Natural Gas Information Sharing Analysis Center. Thank you.
    Ms. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
    Mr. Garbarino. The gentlelady yields back.
    I recognize myself now for 5 minutes of questioning.
    Mr. McCabe, you looked like you were jumping out of your 
seat when Mr. Swalwell asked Mr. Kudale a question about 
standardization, and I wanted to let you--whether the Federal 
Government should get involved in that. Because insurance is 
usually a State issue. We let each State come up with their own 
rules, and it's governed by the State.
    So what was your response to that question?
    Mr. McCabe. I was just leaning in to hear the answer.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. McCabe. But I understand the issue around standardizing 
language. I mean, when the policies are written differently and 
it's not your 9-to-5 job to review cyber insurance policies, it 
could be confusing, one to the other.
    I can confirm that there's a wide amount of overlap for 
every cyber insurance policy. They largely cover the same 
thing, they largely have the same exclusions. A lot of the 
language is very common.
    The one thing about standardization that doesn't make me 
feel particularly good is it's still an emerging line of 
coverage. There's still a point of innovation where carriers 
are coming out and trying to figure out how they want to 
address the risk.
    They're coming up--there is a very innovative approach by 
one carrier where they've defined a wide-spread event that's 
going to have many of their insureds impacted. They will 
provide full limits for that event. But why they do it is they 
design their own exposure mitigation behind it.
    So they're thinking through what their aggregation risks 
are, and sometimes that language is going to be reflected in 
how they write the policy. You would hate to see some kind of 
very regulatory effort to stymie that.
    Mr. Garbarino. This is a follow-up question, because if we 
do--if there is somehow--some people have said Federal 
backstop. I'm not saying that's the answer, and I don't know 
how deep we want to get into that today.
    But if the Federal Government does do a backstop, should 
we--and, again, I am a huge proponent of States doing 
insurance. I do not want us taking over--the Federal Government 
taking over any sort of insurance policy really.
    But if we do have a backstop, how much--and, Mr. Kudale, 
you can jump in on this, too--how much should we be involved, 
though, in the issuing of policies, in the--what should our--if 
we're going to get involved with the money, what else should we 
get involved with?
    Mr. Kudale. Thank you for the question. I can jump on it.
    We had two examples today, TRIA, as well as NFIP. I mean, 
they're designed for different purposes and the involvement of 
Government in the private sector.
    To the extent the issue of the private cyber insurance 
market has the limitations, it's really the lack in the 
coverage primarily into the realm of a catastrophic risk trade. 
Although we have new players coming into ILS and the 
reinsurance market recently, that market is still maturing. 
It's not, they're good enough.
    My personal opinion is a Government reinsurance facility 
that's structured somewhat like TRIA is probably a much better 
line approach so that the Government does not have to sit in as 
an insurer alongside other insurance like the NFIP does. 
Although the NFIP program has amazing risk management practices 
and codes, there's obviously the best of both.
    But most of the limitation on the primary cyber market is 
because of a lack of maturity into the catastrophic risk trade 
really.
    Mr. Garbarino. Any other witnesses?
    Mr. McCabe, you want to jump in?
    Mr. McCabe. If I may, I just would resist any kind of 
framing that said the backstop is about what we need to do for 
insurance companies, because that's not true at all.
    So insurance policies contain a war exclusion for nation-
state attacks, and they contain exclusions about disabling and 
disrupting critical infrastructure.
    The thought is that if we're going to have this big of a 
catastrophic event, it's going to trigger one of these two 
exclusions, and insurance carriers are not going to have to pay 
on those losses. That's their way of managing their exposure.
    What the backstop is about are the companies that are going 
to be left with that risk on their own books, and how is the 
Government going to help those small and medium-sized and large 
businesses that are going to be impacted? It's a U.S. economic 
security problem.
    Mr. Garbarino. Absolutely. Look, we've seen Colonial 
Pipeline change health care. These are small compared to what 
we're talking about today. I mean, this is--I'm going to follow 
up, because I'm going to do a second round of questions. But 
this is--we're talking about things that people aren't even 
expecting.
    I know, Ms. Lee, you made the comment about we got to--we 
might have to go on the offense against some of our--and that's 
something Mr. Gimenez loves to talk about. I wish he was here 
so he could talk about it further.
    But this is not--when people think of cyber attacks here, 
they think of Colonial Pipeline, think of change. That's 
nothing compared to what could actually happen and where this 
would really trigger.
    So I'm going to go--come around for a second question, but 
I know I'm out for this time.
    So I'm going to recognize my friend from Mississippi, Mr. 
Ezell, for 5 minutes of questions.
    Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Thank you all for being here today and discussing this.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for getting this going here.
    In recent years, the cyber insurance market has seen 
significant growth largely driven by the rise in volume of 
these cyber attacks. Businesses of all size have come to 
recognize the importance of cyber insurance as a crucial 
component of the risk management strategies.
    However, the absence of a standardized policy and 
underwriting process apparently has created some confusion and 
leading to coverage limitations and high premiums.
    Mr. McCabe, can you briefly describe how cyber insurance 
varies by company and sector, including what is typically 
covered under a cybersecurity policy and what is not?
    Mr. McCabe. Sure. I would break down coverage on cyber 
insurance into really three buckets.
    You've had a cyber incident, and what are you going to pay 
out of pocket. So you're probably going to have a forensic 
investigation. You might have the costs associated with the 
cyber extortion. You might have a data breach where you have to 
afford credit monitoring to those who are impacted. There's 
probably legal expenses involved with all this.
    So it's those immediate incident response costs that you 
have to pay for is the first bucket.
    The second bucket, your business will be disabled for a 
period of time, and there might be lost revenue and extra 
expenses.
    Then the third bucket, in case there's any litigation, it 
would be the liability and the legal fees associated with that.
    That's largely what cyber insurance does.
    As far as what's not covered, we've talked about some--how 
large events will be excluded. Then there's a very standard set 
of exclusions.
    But I think the confusion that often comes up is there will 
be a claim about a cyber incident that might be put on a 
commercial general liability policy that's declined. It will 
say, well, cyber claim is--I mean, cyber insurance policies pay 
claim after claim after claim.
    People rely on these for those 3 buckets, they rely on them 
for the incident response services, and they have great 
benefits and incentives otherwise for improving cyber hygiene.
    Mr. Ezell. Thank you.
    What cybersecurity practices do cyber insurance providers 
expect companies to implement to qualify for coverage?
    Mr. McCabe. I mean, there are definitely war stories in the 
industry associated with this.
    So in 2018, 2019, when ransomware really became an epidemic 
for companies, it was laser-focused about what the controls are 
going to be most important for stymieing ransomware as a 
threat, and those are now mandatory.
    Those are things like end-point detection and response, 
privileged access management to make sure that your user 
credentials aren't compromised, multifactor authentication to 
verify that the user who is coming on-line is actually that 
person and not some threat actor, your patch cadence, to make 
sure that vulnerabilities don't exist in your software.
    At Marsh McLennan, we aggregated the 12 most crucial 
controls that we ascertained through a polling of the carriers, 
and we put out publications to all of our insureds and to the 
market in general: These 12 controls are now mandatory for your 
coverage for ransomware. They quickly became implemented.
    Prior to that, there was a very similar exercise with 
credit cards. Credit card breaches started happening in a big 
way in 2014 and quickly we started using tokenization and chip 
cards, and that went away.
    So we are always--there's nothing novel that the insurance 
industry invents. We just prioritize the standards, and we make 
sure those are communicated to the insureds.
    Mr. Ezell. Very good. Thank you.
    Ms. Denbow, in May this subcommittee held a hearing on 
private-sector perspectives regarding the proposed rule to 
implement the cyber-incident reporting for Critical 
Infrastructure Act.
    While this rule aims to establish a standard for incident 
reporting, several agencies have developed their own cyber-
incident reporting regulations.
    How do entities within the gas sector view this regulatory 
landscape in terms of their ability to respond to a 
catastrophic cyber attack?
    Ms. Denbow. Congressman, thank you very much for that 
question.
    What you're getting to is the topic or word du jour, which 
is harmonization. We're hearing that everywhere. To be honest 
with you, it's a pipe dream.
    Mr. Ezell. Yeah.
    Ms. Denbow. The reason why it is--no pun intended about 
pipe.
    Mr. Ezell. Got it. Got it.
    Ms. Denbow. But the reason why it is, is because, No. 1, 
CISA does not have the authority to incentivize the other 
agencies to follow suit and to follow CISA's lead.
    No. 2, the other agencies are not incentivized. They have 
no incentive to follow CISA's lead.
    No. 3, the problem is, at the end of the day it becomes the 
responsibility of the operator to make sure all of these 
Government entities are harmonized.
    So it's almost like the teenager trying to get the parents 
to act appropriately, and it is just not going to happen.
    I speak from personal experience because at the American 
Gas Association, through the Oil and Natural Gas Subsector 
Coordinating Council, we intentionally tried to harmonize CFATS 
with the Coast Guard's cybersecurity assessment plan. CFATS was 
totally on board; the Coast Guard was not. End of story.
    Mr. Ezell. Well, that's typical of the Federal Government. 
Harmony and getting things done in a timely manner, in a 
cooperative way, is very hard, to get things done with the 
Federal Government.
    Thank you very much.
    Ms. Denbow. Yes, sir. Harmonization works as long as you're 
singing the song of whoever that agency is.
    Mr. Ezell. One hundred percent. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Garbarino. The gentleman yields back.
    I wish we could get CFATS done, but there's a certain 
Senator from Kentucky keeping us from getting it done. But 
hopefully one of these days.
    We're going to start our second round, and I'm going to 
recognize Ms. Lee from Florida for her second round of 
questions.
    Ms. Lee. Ms. Denbow, I'd like to pick up right where you 
and Mr. Ezell just left off. Because when we go out and talk to 
stakeholders and corporations and people in Washington, DC, we 
hear the request for harmonization all the time, that they 
suffer trying to comply with multiple and inconsistent 
regulatory schemes or reporting structures.
    So if we are to accept that true harmonization is a pipe 
dream, are there nonetheless things we could be doing better? 
Are there things that we, as Members of Congress, could still 
do to try to diminish or alleviate some of that burden of those 
inconsistent systems?
    Ms. Denbow. I believe that when I say that it is a pipe 
dream, I mean trying to harmonize the entire Government is a 
pipe dream. It would be great if DHS could just harmonize 
within its own walls.
    This is why, when we did this practice of CFATS with the 
Coast Guard, that's both DHS, it's within the same family, and 
we could not get that to happen.
    So I think if you could start local and then go wider, that 
would be valuable.
    I think--I will say that, specifically for natural gas 
utilities, not only are we TSA, we are CFATS, we are Coast 
Guard, and for our combination gas and electric we are NERC. 
That doesn't count for other energy sources.
    So it is a lot. So we are wanting to be a player to help 
bring all of this together. This is why we keep trying to drive 
this.
    Do I have a solution for Congress on this? I'll have to go 
back and think harder on that.
    Right now, I have just been trying to figure out how we, 
industry, can help drive to bring Government together.
    Ms. Lee. Mr. Cilluffo, did you have thoughts on that 
question?
    Mr. Cilluffo. First, I agree with everything that has been 
said here inasmuch as I understand it. But I do think the 
Office of the National Cyber Director could be a little bit of 
a bellybutton to drive at least the cyber piece.
    Now, my view is it should all be outcome-based. We always 
have these check the boxes and everyone is going to have their 
own boxes they want to check, and it ends up being just a 
massive knot that never comes together.
    But if you can go to outcome-based approaches, and if you 
can get NCD, that Office of the National Cyber Director, to 
play the quarterback role it can play, I think we can actually 
make some progress.
    We're never going to get there 100 percent. But it should 
be outcome-based. That's just not the way most of the 
approaches are right now, because it is a headache. If you're a 
company, you can have 15 different regulators you got to go to, 
all of whom disagree.
    So the point is, is I think there--I normally say a 
pessimist is an optimist with experience. I'm a little more 
optimistic on this one, which is nice. So I think it can move, 
but not on its own. It's going to have to take some pushing 
from industry and Congress.
    Ms. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
    Mr. Garbarino. The gentlelady yields back.
    I recognize myself now for 5 minutes.
    There are 16 critical infrastructure sectors. Energy sector 
has a very good--they're very good at their cyber, pretty well, 
and financial sector has a very good cyber defense.
    There are areas like the water sector that really they 
could do a lot better because there's so many different small 
water agencies across--water utilities across the country.
    In 2023, Iranian-backed threat actors infiltrated a water 
utility in Pennsylvania affecting about 7,000 people. That's 
not what we're here to talk about. We're here about if they 
shut down the Northeast or the State of Florida or somehow shut 
down all of it.
    What do we do? I mean, Mr. Cilluffo, what's the next--
what's the day after tomorrow in that situation? Like, if all 
of a sudden they can shut off every water utility in New York 
State, what do we do next?
    By the way, water utility--shutting down the water affects 
other critical infrastructure sectors.
    So what do we do? Are we prepared?
    I'm going to start with you, but I'm going to open it up to 
everybody else.
    Mr. Cilluffo. OK. First bite of the apple. I'm sure others 
have many ideas.
    But, first, you're goading me a little bit on the 16 
critical infrastructures because I do feel space should have 
been designated a critical infrastructure. Whether it's 
positioning, navigation, timing, signaling, space and cyber are 
inextricably interwoven. To me it's kind-of ludicrous that 
people haven't recognized that. But that's besides the point.
    In terms of the sectors themselves, if everything is 
critical, nothing is critical. You're absolutely right. You've 
seen one water system, you've seen one water system. In part, 
you're going--you'll have some that are municipalities, some 
that are industry, some that are State government, and the 
like, and that is a weak point.
    I think it's also, though, the committees on Capitol Hill--
not to point it back to both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue--but 
your committee has the horsepower to get things done and the 
sectors that are, in part, there are doing some of their work. 
I can't say the same when you look at water in particular.
    When you think cyber, you're going to think what? You're 
going to think Homeland Security, Armed Services, and 
Intelligence. That's the reality of it.
    So part of it, I think, is you've got a little bit of a 
disconnect between both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue on that 
one. I really do think there is--the public safety concerns 
around water are massive and the resources aren't.
    Mr. Garbarino. Anybody else want to----
    Mr. Cilluffo. Policy without resources is rhetoric. Sorry. 
I had to throw that in there.
    Mr. Garbarino. Anybody else want to jump in on that?
    Ms. Denbow. If I may, Congressman.
    There's a lot to protect, and we have to get it right 100 
percent of the time, and they just have to get it right once. 
I'm talking about the adversary.
    So trying to protect everything 100 percent of the time 
makes absolutely no possible sense for anyone. So this is why 
we at the American Gas Association, natural gas utilities, and 
the oil and natural gas subsector, we're driving risk-based 
approach because this way the most critical operations are the 
ones that are getting the immediate attention.
    Then, once those are secured, then we pay attention to the 
small and medium enterprise because, again, they are so 
critical to us as well, just at a different level. So we 
almost, without having it written in this way, there's a 
tiering where we expect the large utilities to help the small 
utilities and bringing them along.
    Mr. Garbarino. Thank you. All right.
    Mr. McCabe, I do want to ask you a question.
    One of the aspects of cyber insurability is developing 
robust cyber hygiene that helps both deterrence and recovery 
from cyber attacks. Accumulation of vulnerabilities and the 
growing number of threat vectors and actors require ever-
increasing vigilance.
    What lessons has the insurance industry learned about 
resilience efforts and risk management strategies?
    Mr. McCabe. So thank you very much for the question.
    I would reiterate the point around for when there were 
credit card breaches of actually the cyber insurance renewals, 
pushing those standards on to industry, the retail industry, 
for ransomware, how there was responding with the 12 critical 
controls. This has taken effect.
    So just to throw some stats out at you. In 2023, 77 percent 
of companies declined to pay the ransoms for Marsh clients. 
That is way up from 2021 where only 37 percent of our clients 
with ransomware claims had declined to pay them.
    So that's showing a much greater cyber hygiene evolving. A 
lot of it has to do with, are you segmenting your back-up data, 
are you keeping immutable back-up data, are you doing best 
practices?
    I think the trick about cybersecurity is constant 
assessment. There's always a changing landscape of the attack. 
It's always a matter of looking for new threat intelligence, 
seeing how the threat actors are behaving, and being able to 
adapt to that.
    I think with the continuous monitoring that's really 
becoming more prevalent within our industry, we have the 
opportunity to feed more information to insureds, especially 
small and mid-sized businesses. I think for incident response 
services, those will always be important.
    Mr. Garbarino. Thank you very much.
    I'm out of time. I'm going to yield now to the Ranking 
Member. I'll let you go and then I'm going to--no, it's fine. 
I'll go to you and then I'll finish with him.
    Ranking Member, 5 minutes.
    Mr. Swalwell. Thank you, Chairman.
    I want to talk about the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative.
    Ms. Denbow, I know you brought it up. I think others have 
brought it up as well.
    Can we first talk, Ms. Denbow, about your experience with 
the JCDC and how its work has helped drive resilience in the 
pipeline sector?
    Ms. Denbow. Thank you, Ranking Member.
    So I will tell you that my first encounter with the JCDC, 
they met with the Oil and Natural Gas Subsector Coordinating 
Council, and they came in and they had this grand plan of what 
they were going to do. By the end of the hour, they had 
realized that they had completely missed the mark.
    The Oil and Natural Gas Subsector Coordinating Council is 
not a very quiet council. So we made it very clear to them that 
we're not going to play because what they plan on doing is 
going to waste everyone's time.
    So they came back, and they sat and they listened. Out of 
that came probably, I would say, one of the most functional and 
effective tools and engagement that the pipeline sector could 
have with the Federal Government from a voluntary perspective. 
They came out with a pipeline reference architecture overview 
where they convened not only Government with the industry, the 
private sector, owners and operators, but also with the 
vendors.
    That was where we said--they said, ``Why don't you just do 
this with the vendors?'' We said we cannot because of antitrust 
reasons.
    They found a solution, and they addressed that, and they 
brought us all together. They came up with tools. We all worked 
on tools, a network diagram and principles, that could then be 
publicly available to help others.
    So that is an example of where coming together to find out 
what are the fences and the hurdles that are in the way, 
bringing those down, because we need the Government to do that, 
so that we can all come together and get the solutions.
    Mr. Swalwell. Great. I appreciate that. That's what we hope 
it is and how it operates, and you just animated that. That's 
incredibly helpful.
    But, of course, like any Government agency, it's not 
perfect. I'd be interested, Mr. Cilluffo--pronounce that for me 
again. Cilluffo?
    Mr. Cilluffo. Perfect. I've been called whatever it is 
worse. Frank is great.
    Mr. Swalwell. I have concerns that you risk with JCDC, 
without having more structure and scaffolding, that it is only 
a collection of the people that its directors know best. We are 
fortunate that the past 2 directors, Mr. Krebs and Ms. 
Easterly, have been dynamic.
    However, say you have a director who brings one skill but, 
like, their network or their relationships is not necessarily 
their best skill, and they're not able to as quickly stand up 
membership into JCDC.
    So I'm hoping that--and I'd like to do it in a bipartisan 
way--we could put together membership criteria, so to speak, 
and also exit criteria in the event that you have a member who 
is not faithful or not participating.
    The one complaint I hear from people who are not in JCDC 
is, ``We don't know how the hell you get in. It's not clear how 
you get into it.''
    The complaint I hear the most from people who are in it is 
that, while it is supposed to be a 2-way sharing exercise of 
intelligence, it too often feels like it's one way, of private 
sector to CISA, and not enough the other way.
    So I was hoping you could just speak to any efforts to, as 
I said, formalize JCDC in a way that has structure and 
scaffolding and more transparency about who is in, who is out, 
what's shared, what's not.
    Mr. Cilluffo. Congressman Swalwell, I think you bring up a 
number of very important and valid points. As with anything, it 
needs to move from individuals to institutions and 
personalities to processes, and I think you're spot-on there. 
Criteria is essential.
    The concern I have is also small, medium-sized--other 
entities that don't have an appropriate way to plug into all of 
this should still be beneficiaries, especially if there are any 
tax dollars thrown to some of those issues.
    So I think you're spot-on with looking at what some of that 
criteria can look like. I mentioned it briefly earlier, JCDC 
does work well when they have something to galvanize around. 
It's, what are they doing every other day when something isn't 
going boom? That's what we've got to figure out.
    That is what I think. You're not going to work well 
together when something goes boom if you're exchanging business 
cards when the bomb goes off. It's just not the way it works. 
It takes time, it takes trust, it takes fighting the same 
fight.
    So I do think with any collaborative entity with the 
Federal Government, there are two things. First, you need 
trust. Second, there can't be free riders. There's a lot of 
that where sometimes industry just wants to be. What you put 
into it will be directly applicable to what you get out of it.
    The reality is, is when it comes to JCDC, I think it's 
early. For transparency, this was a Solarium Commission 
recommendation, so I'm biased toward it, and we called it--we 
had the worst acronyms. We had good outcomes in terms of 
legislative success, but we called it JCPO and JCE, the Joint 
Cyber Environment and the Joint Cyber Planning Office, so bad 
acronyms.
    But the points that you raise, I think, will help it mature 
and, quite honestly, are probably normal in terms of where its 
trajectory is.
    Mr. Swalwell. Thank you. I yield back.
    Mr. Garbarino. The gentleman yields back.
    They just called votes for us, but I know attendance is a 
little sparse today, so I'm going to--I'll start with Mr. 
Kudale before we end.
    This is a very important hearing. I think this is the first 
time cyber insurance has been discussed this in-depth at any 
hearing on the House side. I don't know if they've done it on 
the Senate side.
    So I want to let--I want to have each one of you have 
another minute, if there was something you wanted to get on the 
record that you didn't get to say today. Believe me, there's 
going to be a lot of questions that we're going to submit after 
this for you all to respond to.
    But I want to give you all at least another opportunity, a 
minute each, to just put something on the record that you 
wanted to get on that you haven't been able to get on yet.
    Mr. Kudale.
    Mr. Kudale. Chairman Garbarino and Ranking Member Swalwell, 
thank you for having me here.
    I do want to just spend maybe 20 seconds addressing your 
previous question regarding lessons learned. I think it will be 
a miss for me if I don't state that for the record.
    First and foremost, cyber crime. No one is immune to that. 
In a supply chain, interconnectivity and interdependency, 
someone else's cyber problem could be my problem as an SME. I 
think that's the biggest learning, that no one is immune, 
especially our SME community. That's No. 1.
    No. 2, our learning is for SMEs, if they didn't have cyber 
insurance in place, it would have been really hard for them to 
navigate the incident that took place, and they will be--it 
would have been a business-ending event for them. That's the 
second.
    The third lesson that we learned big time is all the 
components that some of the witnesses mentioned here with 
respect to forensics, incident response, risk council, risk 
engineering, these services, SMEs don't get it on their own.
    So we believe that, and also my opinion, is cyber insurers 
can play an amazing role in helping risk mitigation for the 
businesses, the 80 percent that are uninsured today.
    So that would be the last point I would make, and I really 
appreciate you having me here. Thank you.
    Mr. Garbarino. I agree with you about that.
    Ms. Denbow.
    Ms. Denbow. Just as there is a role for practical 
regulations, reasonable regulations, there is a role for 
quality cyber insurance, to not just help provide the financial 
backstop for someone, for an organization, but to help that 
organization get better at what it's doing so that it can 
actually qualify for the insurance.
    So there's many aspects to be looking at when it comes to 
cyber insurance and how we can use that as a tool to leverage, 
to help organizations become better, owner-operators become 
better at just simple cyber hygiene, I think that that's where 
we want to be headed.
    Thank you.
    Mr. Garbarino. Thank you.
    Mr. McCabe.
    Mr. McCabe. Thank you very much.
    I think I would just emphasize that cyber insurance is 
truly a critical component for organizations in their risk 
management strategy.
    Every now and again you hear a voice come out of a policy 
maker that will say, gee, if it wasn't for cyber insurance, 
ransomware actors wouldn't be quite so active at this point and 
you're encouraging it. That is the furthest thing from the 
truth.
    I mean, cyber insurance really provides the tools for 
companies to get better. It's the incentives for organizations 
to get better. It's the education for organizations to get 
better. We're interested in partnership. We're interested in 
distributing threat intelligence information and working with 
the Government in finding solutions.
    Mr. Garbarino. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Cilluffo.
    Mr. Cilluffo. I'll be very brief. Never had an unspoken 
thought.
    But bottom line is, is outcome-based. I'm a big believer in 
market forces, but where they do fall short, that's where we 
titrate, and we get that partnership going together. Because 
truth is, is companies didn't think they had to defend 
themselves against the PLA and the SVR, and we do need to get 
our arms around what that looks like and, ultimately, build the 
business case.
    So try to unleash the strengths and get it done.
    Mr. Garbarino. I appreciate it.
    I thank all the witnesses for your valuable testimony today 
and the Members for their questions. The Members of the 
subcommittee will have additional questions for the witnesses 
and we would ask the witnesses to respond to these in writing. 
Pursuant to committee rule VII(D), the hearing record will be 
held open for 10 days.
    Without objection, this subcommittee stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 3:37 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

     Questions From Chairman Andrew Garbarino for Frank J. Cilluffo
    Question 1. How can the Federal Government better incentivize 
private-sector investment in advanced cybersecurity measures and 
encourage the adoption of cyber insurance as a key component of risk 
management?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Question 2. The Biden administration did not change any of the 
critical infrastructure sectors under National Security Memorandum 22 
(NSM-22), which replaced the 2014 Presidential Policy Directive 21 
(PPD-21).
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Knowing that today's threat landscape is different from when the 
critical infrastructure sectors were named, and recognizing that the 
risk of a catastrophic cyber attack is elevated, do you agree with this 
decision? Why or why not?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Question 3. How would cyber insurance help mitigate the impact, and 
what conversations would need to happen in advance of this major 
attack? Are there unique aspects of the water sector that may prevent 
water utilities from securing insurance that would give them assurance 
in this instance?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Question 4a. Colonial Pipeline and Change Healthcare were both 
ransomware attacks. How would you assess the recovery responses and 
time lines in these two instances?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Question 4b. Are there lessons we can apply across sectors about 
preparedness, response, and recovery? Do you think that Sector Risk 
Management Agencies (SRMAs) currently share these lessons sufficiently, 
and are there lessons they should incorporate into their rewrites of 
their Sector-Specific Plans?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Question 4c. Colonial Pipeline would have been much more damaging 
if the attack had impacted the operational technology (OT). Knowing 
that OT is a target because it is often outdated, what best practices 
can owners and operators implement to ensure impacts are isolated to IT 
environments, which can be easily taken off-line and patched?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Question 5. From your perspective, what would a Terrorism Risk 
Insurance Program (TRIP) for cyber look like?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Question 6. From your perspective, at what point is the risk of a 
cyber attack ``systemic'' and what does this mean for insurability?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
      Questions From Chairman Andrew Garbarino for Matthew McCabe
    Question 1. How does the size of the business impact risk calculus 
in the eyes of a cyber insurance and reinsurance provider, and 
consequently the coverage plans that are offered?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Question 2. How much do cyber insurance providers for critical 
infrastructure entities base their coverage on Sector-Specific Plans?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Question 3. National Security Memorandum 22 (NSM-22) reinforced the 
need to identify ``systemically important entities (SIEs)'', which 
Director Easterly described as a list that prioritizes Federal 
activities based on the potential for ``disruption or malfunction'' 
that would have nationally significant impacts.
    How are cyber insurance providers thinking about providing coverage 
to these entities, which are inherently high-risk due to their 
designation?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Question 4. Do you agree with FBI Director Wray that Volt Typhoon 
is ``the defining threat of our generation''? Why or why not?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Question 5. How does the cyber insurance industry track and factor 
emerging threats, such as Volt Typhoon, into its coverage? Would you 
distinguish coverage plans for sectors that have historically weak 
cybersecurity practices from those with historically strong ones, even 
though it is the same, sophisticated threat actor?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Question 6. From your perspective, what would a Terrorism Risk 
Insurance Program (TRIP) for cyber look like?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
      Questions From Chairman Andrew Garbarino for Kimberly Denbow

differing sizes have with cyber insurance providers. What do they look 
for in cyber insurance policies?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Question 2. The Biden administration did not change any of the 
critical infrastructure sectors under National Security Memorandum 22 
(NSM-22), which replaced the 2014 Presidential Policy Directive 21 
(PPD-21).
    Knowing that today's threat landscape is different from when the 
critical infrastructure sectors were named, and recognizing that the 
risk of a catastrophic cyber attack is elevated, do you agree with this 
decision? Why or why not?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Question 3. Do you see any knowledge gaps within your sector's 
cyber workforce regarding:
    a. cyber insurance, which would need to be addressed in order to 
        improve organizational preparedness?
    b. the convergence of information technology (IT) and operational 
        technology (OT), which would help secure their development and 
        maintenance?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Question 4. The energy sector was identified as one of the most 
impacted sectors by Volt Typhoon. Please expand on how companies in the 
gas industry are viewing and responding to this threat actor.

    Question 5. What are the unique difficulties that the gas industry 
faces that may make securing cyber insurance more challenging?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Question 6. Please describe how your interactions with the 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have been when 
your sector has experienced cyber attacks.
    Do you think this relationship will change with the final Cyber 
Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA) rule and 
the release of NSM-22? Why or why not?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Question 7. Does the Federal Government provide clear guidance and 
mechanisms for assistance should your sector face a sector-wide cyber 
attack? If not, what can the Federal Government provide that would be 
useful to your sector?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Question 8. From your perspective, at what point is the risk of a 
cyber attack ``systemic'' and what does this mean for insurability?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
        Questions From Chairman Andrew Garbarino for Jack Kudale
    Question 1. How much do cyber insurance providers for critical 
infrastructure entities base their coverage on Sector-Specific Plans?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Question 2. Cyber insurance protects against man-made events. 
However, the frequency and impact of cyber attacks vary substantially, 
and we currently do not have the historical records nor the same level 
of detailed metrics available as man-made events to quantify trends. 
How do these factors impact the cyber insurance market?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Question 3. How do carriers currently manage the gap between 
customer expectations and coverage terms and conditions? For example, 
if a ``smart vehicle'' could be hacked, should consumers anticipate 
having cyber insurance in addition to automobile insurance?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.

     Statement of Lucian Niemeyer, CEO, Building Cyber Security.org
                              July 6, 2024
    Chairman Garbarino, Ranking Member Swalwell, and distinguished 
Members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to provide 
written testimony for the record. On behalf of the national non-profit 
organization, BuildingCyberSecurity.Org (BCS), we appreciate your 
leadership and attention to critical cyber risk management matters. I 
am Lucian Niemeyer, the chief executive officer of 
BuildingCyberSecurity.org, a collective of private-sector companies 
committed to enhancing human cyber security and physical safety in the 
built environment. Previously, I served 11 years as professional staff 
on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I also served as an assistant 
secretary of defense responsible for managing the Department's 
enterprise facility, energy, and environmental programs. At the request 
of the Secretary of Defense, my tenure also focused on mitigating cyber 
threats to operational technologies across the DoD's global assets with 
the understanding that the homeland is no longer a sanctuary, and that 
our Nation is vulnerable to cyber attacks. I also served as a senior 
official on national security matters in the White House's Office of 
Management and Budget. In my current role at BCS, I work closely with 
insurance brokers, actuaries, and underwriters to offer risk assessment 
and pricing strategies for property and casualty policies.
    BuildingCyberSecurity.org (BCS)\1\ was formed in 2020 to offer 
solutions to the growing cyber threat to public safety by establishing 
performance frameworks across multiple critical infrastructure sectors 
to mitigate cyber risk to operational technologies (OT). Given the rise 
of smart homes, communities, and cities, our goal of enhancing the 
physical safety and security in the built environment is ever more 
urgent. BCS is focused on human safety globally by incentivizing 
investments in OT, processes, training, and recovery plans to enhance 
the security of cyber-physical systems against rapidly-evolving threats 
in technologically advancing societies. BCS has established the first 
cyber risk performance framework for the commercial facility sector in 
partnership with the International Society of Automation (ISA), the 
Center for Internet Security (CIS), and building industry associations. 
The BCS framework incorporates standards from IEC/ISA 62443 and the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the MITRE 
ATT&CK Framework, and other publicly-available standards in an 
assessment and certification process tailored explicitly to commercial 
facilities' connected systems and technologies. The BCS framework 
prioritizes protecting systems and technologies impacting occupants' 
lives, safety, or health. BCS has benefited from the strong support of 
cybersecurity experts in the insurance industry to develop an incentive 
for asset owners to invest and take action to reduce the risk to human 
safety.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A series of extensive hearings and reporting, including in front of 
your subcommittee, showcased that we have reached an unprecedented risk 
to our way of life from cyber threats. The threats to the OT 
environment, including targeting critical infrastructure sectors of 
water, grid, ports, hospitals, and transportation systems, have been 
broadly documented, and the threat landscape--fueled by the use of AI 
by adversaries--expands each day exponentially. We must take action now 
to address the threats of OT, the internet of things (IoT), and 
insecure assets pose to our Nation. The unique challenges of risk to 
the OT in our national infrastructure pose a direct threat to the 
lives, safety, and health of every American. A catastrophic cyber 
attack on a water system can be carried out from a keyboard anywhere in 
the world at a moment's notice. We've already experienced this attack 
more than once in the United States from different adversaries.
    Bottom Line.--We cannot continue to treat digital threats to OT 
systems (that support critical infrastructure assets) and the insurance 
mechanisms to transfer risk the same way we address information 
technologies (IT) data breaches and network attacks. Attacks on life-
essential operational technologies managing all 16 critical 
infrastructure sectors can threaten public safety, destroy property, 
and kill people. Public policy must recognize the difference in 
consequences, and distinguish the effects of cybersecurity of data/
software, from the public need for ``cyber safety'' as a separate and 
more compelling risk. Adherence to public safety guidelines and 
programs are mandatory responsibilities for owners and c-suites. 
Cybersecurity programs offer a great range of risk management options. 
The fundamental question for a CEO of ``How much is enough to invest in 
cybersecurity'' continues to a subject of litigation. The global 
insurance industry is well-suited to incentivize investments to reduce 
the risk for both of these threats.
    When assessing cyber risk, an asset owner has three choices:
  <bullet> Assume the risk of a cyber attack and the resulting response 
        and recovery costs.
  <bullet> Transfer the risk partially to share costs of response and 
        recovery with an insurance entity.
  <bullet> Mitigate risk through targeted decisions and investments to 
        reduce exposure and enhance protection.
    The choices are informed by basic risk assessments each asset owner 
must make regarding the impact on human/public safety, business 
operations, financial exposure, brand reputation, asset ratings, and 
investor/shareholder confidence. The risk assessment for most critical 
infrastructure asset owners must also extend beyond the asset owner's 
direct control to broader impacts on the safety and economics of 
customers, communities, and the general public.
          delineating consequences for critical infrastructure
    The cyber risk assessment conducted for the exploitation of data, 
the ransom of software or IT systems, distributed denials of service, 
or other virtual activities must be a separate activity from a risk 
assessment of a cyber attack to cyber-physical systems (CPS) in 
critical infrastructure, such as operational technologies, industrial 
control systems, SCADA, etc. An IT attack primarily results in business 
disruption or data exploitation. The first response for a company is to 
gather the IT team, assess the damage, and initiate actions to respond 
to the threat and recover business operations with the assistance of an 
insurance company if covered.
    In most cases, a CPS attack immediately threatens human life, 
safety, or health. From the initial indication of an intrusion or 
attack on the CPS in an asset, the owner has the ultimate 
responsibility, first and foremost, to protect public health and 
safety. As experienced in the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack of 
May 2021,\2\ the seizure of IT systems quickly resulted in the complete 
shutdown of pipelines, not only because of billing disruptions, but as 
a safety precaution to confirm that the attack had not migrated to the 
automated valves and meters controlling product distribution. Had the 
bad actors seized the controls for the pipeline, the threat could have 
been more than a monetary loss, including an environmental or human 
disaster. That attack prompted the Federal Government, under the 
regulatory oversight of the Transportation Security Administration 
(TSA), to bring together more than 25 major pipeline operators and 
industrial control systems partners to strengthen security practices to 
safeguard the operational technology networks critical to pipeline 
operations, efforts that complement the Security Directives TSA issued 
in the aftermath of the attack on Colonial Pipeline.\3\

    Written testimony for this hearing by Kimberly Denbow, vice 
president of security and operations American Gas Association,\4\ has 
recommended the use of the DHS SAFETY Act program to offer companies 
the ability to minimize or even eliminate specific types of tort 
liability following cyber attacks when companies can demonstrate they 
have implemented robust and effective security programs. We agree that 
linking the obtainment and maintenance of SAFETY Act protections to 
cyber insurance would be highly useful in promoting effective 
cybersecurity.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    To implement this proposal, each industry must have a shared 
understanding and agreement of the cybersecurity standards needed for 
protecting assets and public safety. Since all infrastructure systems 
are engineered, a cyber safety ``Standard of Care'' must be developed 
by engineering professionals for the safe design of a system and then 
maintained through to system design, construction, and life-cycle 
operations. care''[sic] must be tailored to each critical 
infrastructure sector. For example, BCS assembled the top experts from 
across the engineering, system manufacturing, and automation industries 
to develop a standard of care ``profile'' for commercial facilities. A 
specific cyber safety standard of care profile must be developed for 
each of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors. A cyber safety standard 
of care can then serve as the legally-recognized basis for determining 
a ``robust and effective cybersecurity program,'' the insurance 
industry has a common framework for each critical infrastructure sector 
to assess IT and CPS risk.
    Standards of Care for the built environment have historically been 
developed by private-sector academic/industry associations and 
promulgated through voluntary adoption or public policy (licensing, 
building codes, statute, etc). BCS has created a performance framework 
to offer a Standard of Care for cybersecurity and safety in the $34 
trillion global commercial facilities sector that insurance 
underwriters can use as an assessment and certification instrument to 
assess and mitigate risk. We have used our framework to perform a cyber 
commissioning process for new facilities on behalf of insurance 
companies to evaluate the safety and security of the connected building 
systems. National architectural/engineering companies are also using 
the BCS framework to inform the design of new or modernized buildings 
to be cyber-secure and safe for occupants.
    The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) released the Congressionally-
directed National Cyber-Informed Engineering Strategy \5\ in 2022 
outline the core concepts that place cybersecurity considerations at 
the foundation of engineering and energy systems design. The CIE 
integrates cybersecurity considerations into the conception, design, 
development, and operation of any physical system, energy or otherwise, 
to mitigate or even eliminate avenues for cyber-enabled attacks. CIE 
concepts use design decisions and engineering controls to prioritize 
defense against the worst possible consequences of cyber attacks facing 
critical infrastructure systems and asset owners.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The CIE strategy recognizes that protecting human safety from cyber 
threats in critical infrastructure is more than developing a ``secure 
by design''\6\ standard for software and technologies. A cyber safety 
Standard of Care must include additional sensors and technologies to 
protect the IT/OT interface and to warn humans if a system or device is 
being exploited to create an unsafe condition.

    Other critical infrastructure sectors have varying degrees of 
Federal regulation to protect the public, rely on industry-derived 
standards, or fall back to the determinations by each asset owner on a 
range of risks to be assumed, transferred, or mitigated. For a rapidly-
evolving landscape of cyber risk, the lack of industry standards for 
cyber safety exacerbates the ability to obtain comprehensive coverage.
                        global insurance trends
    Munich Re estimates that global cyber crime costs will reach $13.8 
trillion by 2028.\7\ The global cyber insurance market is projected to 
expand by $42.81 billion from 2022 to 2027, with a forecasted CAGR of 
35.92%. In 2023, the market grew 30.9% on a year-on-year (YoY) basis, 
according to Technavio.\8\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    At the same time, insurers initiated rules to reduce exposure, 
including limiting or eliminating coverage if the cyber attack is 
conducted as part of or related to an ``act of war,'' or carried out by 
nation-states or their affiliates.
    As of March 31, 2023, when coverage begins or is renewed, 
syndicates have begun excluding state-backed cyber attacks from 
policies that protect against physical and digital damage caused by 
hacks; the terms of these exclusions vary widely and are difficult for 
asset owners/operators to evaluate and for Federal agencies or the 
courts to verify.
    As a result, public policy for the insurance industry must address 
the exposure not only for the cyber insurance market but for other 
policies that a cyber attack on critical infrastructure may trigger. 
The effects of ``silent cyber''\9\ risk (potential cyber-related losses 
stemming from traditional property and liability policies that were not 
explicitly designed to cover cyber risk) are being litigated in courts 
for policies covering:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <bullet> Property--material damage and business interruption from 
        physical loss or damage to tangible property.
  <bullet> Casualty--Third-party bodily injury and property damage 
        liability.
  <bullet> General liability--Third-party bodily injury, property 
        damage liability, advertising, and personal injury.
  <bullet> Directors and Officers--Coverage for litigation or 
        regulatory action arising from failure to disclose, 
        misrepresentations, or breaches of fiduciary duty.
    Cyber policies generally cover loss, theft, or damage to electronic 
data and violations of privacy laws with a suite of first-party 
coverage to help the insured get systems back on-line, deal with the 
threat actors, and provide identity theft notification, prevention, and 
remediation service as required by law. A traditional cyber policy will 
not cover physical damage to property or equipment caused by a cyber 
attack. Critical infrastructure owners are left with significant gaps 
in coverage and few options to transfer the risk of physical loss or 
harm. The real question for policy makers should be--how easy should it 
be to transfer public safety risk versus being required to mitigate the 
risk from ever happening? Critical infrastructure owners/operators are 
using automation and the convergence of IT, IoT, and OT to reduce 
operating costs and improve efficiencies. A portion of those savings 
must be reapplied to mitigate the cyber risk and reduce the 
vulnerability assumed from those actions.
    The Federal Government is considering a program \10\ to address 
this risk by offering the cyber insurance industry a Federal backstop, 
modeled on existing programs (Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIP) 
or FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)). The taxpayer would 
be the reinsurer of last resort if a cyber attack proves too 
catastrophic for insurers to cover. While this may offer the insurance 
industry some stability, we contend that for public safety risk in 
critical infrastructure, every dollar spent on transferring cyber risk 
and recovery costs to an insurer or the Federal Government is a lost 
opportunity to invest in risk mitigations and exposure reduction. For 
the public safety risk posed by cyber threats to our Nation's critical 
infrastructure, public policy must prioritize actions and investments 
to protect systems from attack and minimize the impact on lives, 
health, and property. The qualifications for any Federal backstop 
program for a major cyber incident must require documented and 
confirmed actions by the insurance entity that a cyber risk mitigation 
program meeting industry standards was in place and actively managed or 
monitored at the time of an attack.

                      insurance industry responses
    Throughout our society, home and automobile owners are required by 
financing institutions or local/State agencies to maintain property and 
casualty policies in the case of an accident or event. The cost and 
types of coverage for those policies vary by asset value, area, risk 
assessment, and the behavior of the insured entity. Many underwriters 
reward investments for home security systems or reward good driving 
behavior. In both cases, insurance is a tangible incentive for the 
insured to reduce risk. More importantly, these insurance incentives 
are focused on preventing the claim instead of recovering from the 
event. The same reasoning for risk reduction drove the mandatory use in 
automobiles of seatbelts, the installation of airbags, and other safety 
features. (It's still a wonder to me why a modern car with over 2,000 
micro-processing chips managing critical safety performance features 
does not have a warning light for drivers alerting them of an unsafe 
data malfunction. We have sensors for temperature, pressure, 
inflations, and hazards, but nothing to warn of a threatening cyber 
action).
    Bottom line--the insurance industry has a history and continues to 
promote programs to proactively reduce risk to human safety in addition 
to assisting with the costs of response and recovery.
    Cyber Insurance industry expert Tom Finan, senior vice president of 
Willis Towers Watson (Former DHS senior strategist, former U.S. H.R. 
subcommittee director, Former FBI assistant general counsel) and Annie 
McIntyre, chief security officer at EverLine offered a critical 
observation in 2021 on the insurance industry's value to cyber risk. 
``Simply having a cyber insurance policy does not make a company safer. 
Instead, an enhanced cybersecurity posture results from going through 
the cyber insurance application and underwriting process. That process 
provides a huge opportunity for better cyber collaboration and, as a 
result, enhanced risk management. Stated another way, cyber insurance 
can bolster a critical infrastructure company's cyber preparedness 
across the board in the face of unpredictable threats and unknown 
potential consequences.''\11\

    Recent research on cyber insurance trends confirms the incentives 
to invest in mitigations. Sophos, a global leader in innovative 
security solutions for defeating cyber attacks, on June 24, 2024, 
released findings from its vendor-agnostic survey of 5,000 
cybersecurity/IT leaders, ``Cyber Insurance and Cyber Defenses 2024: 
Lessons from IT and Cybersecurity Leaders.'' According to the report, 
97% of those with a cyber policy invested in improving their defenses 
to help with insurance, with 76% saying it enabled them to qualify for 
coverage, 67% to get better pricing, and 30% to secure improved policy 
terms.\13\

    Insurance companies must continue to prioritize risk mitigation, 
vice transfer as the most effective method to manage risk. To respond 
to an ever-changing cyber threat landscape, actuaries and underwriters 
must move beyond periodic audits and surveys at the initial policy 
writing process to require from their customers confirmation of 
programs to enhance cyber hygiene and continuous, effective management 
of cyber protections based on accepted industry standards.
                               conclusion
    Underpinning the insurance industry are globally-accepted 
engineering standards of care that were implemented after catastrophic 
physical disasters as mechanisms and practices to address financial and 
human safety risk. The physical engineering and insurance industries 
came together to address the risk by first developing standards to 
prevent the catastrophe from occurring or by implementing proactive 
measures to reduce the impact. Both evolved and matured their 
protections to match the progression of the industrial world. Today, 
critical infrastructure sectors are rapidly adopting new IT, IoT, and 
OT to improve services and reduce costs. The resulting cyber risk must 
be managed with an emphasis on reducing the risk of catastrophic 
events. Critical infrastructure owners/operators in each sector and 
their insurers must agree on cyber safety standards, starting with a 
shared understanding and development of cyber engineering, or the 
``standard of care.'' To address the unique characteristics of an 
evolving cyber threat, the standards of care must include risk 
management frameworks that offer tiered protection levels as opposed to 
minimum compliance standards. Those tiered protection levels should be 
based on the standard of care profile developed to address the unique 
threats for a specific industry sector. In the evolution of insurance 
instruments to cover a range of cyber threats, cyber-related risks to 
physical safety must first be mitigated and treated as mandatory 
programs before any decision is made to invest in risk transfer 
mechanisms. Public policies and future Federal actions to reduce risk 
for insurers must require the confirmation of programs in place between 
an insurance company and their customer that industry-adopted standards 
for cyber safety and security are being continuously managed and 
monitored. Every company and asset owner prioritizes and invests in 
physical safety programs to reduce employee risk across every aspect of 
operations. Cyber safety must also be part of that culture and included 
in the prioritization of action and priorities.
    I thank you again for your leadership and consideration.
