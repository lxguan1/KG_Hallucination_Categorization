 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GLENN THOMPSON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
                   CONGRESS FROM PENNSYLVANIA

    The Chairman. Good morning, everyone. The Committee will 
come to order. After brief opening remarks, Members will 
receive testimony from our witness today, and then the hearing 
will be open to questions.
    Good morning once again, and welcome to today's hearing to 
receive testimony from the Secretary of Agriculture. I thank my 
colleagues for participating and my friend, Secretary Vilsack, 
for his time. We have a lengthy hearing ahead of us, so I will 
be brief in my remarks.
    For nearly 3 years, I have traveled across the country to 
hear from farmers, ranchers, foresters, rural communities, and 
everyday consumers. Many, many of our colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle have joined me for those travels. The message that 
we have heard from those folks was very clear. They need the 
government to work for them, not against them. These men and 
women have struggled with fractured supply chains, considerable 
input costs, relentless inflation, natural disasters, volatile 
markets, and labor shortages, each consistently worsened by 
ill-conceived half-baked Executive action.
    In what seemingly is a daily occurrence, taxpayer dollars 
are being sent to every corner of the country, yet nothing has 
changed. We are not producing more fertilizer. We are not 
reducing the cost of production. We are not making food more 
affordable. However, we are burdening the taxpayer. We are 
losing ground on the world stage, and we are a net agricultural 
importer. We are less independent, less resilient, and less 
competitive.
    Now, the farm bill is the best opportunity that exists to 
course-correct. Now, I have been clear in my intent. Congress 
can and must craft a bipartisan farm bill that aligns the farm 
safety net with the needs of producers, expands market access 
and trade promotion opportunities, strengthens program 
operations to demand transparency and accountability to the 
taxpayers, and helping our neighbors in need, but doing so 
without indiscriminate expansion of our nutrition safety net.
    However, there remain significant headwinds to Congress' 
success. It is virtually impossible to create a robust and 
resilient farm safety net without significant investment. 
Considerable opportunities exist within our jurisdiction to not 
only fund the safety net, but fund a substantial number of 
shared bipartisan priorities. And I continue to implore my 
Democratic colleagues to think in earnest about these 
priorities, priorities that can be funded without cutting a 
SNAP benefit or eliminating the important conservation programs 
that we have all come to appreciate.
    Washington, D.C. is filled with rhetoric and armchair 
pundits. People go out of their way to work against you. Folks 
think a farm bill is impossible, that politics will prevail 
over good policy, that the dysfunction surrounding us has 
consumed us. Every comment intensifies my commitment to the 
American farmer. I am on your side. I am your champion, and I 
will never stop fighting for you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Thompson follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Glenn Thompson, a Representative in Congress 
                           from Pennsylvania

    We are less independent, less resilient, and less competitive.
    A farm bill is the best opportunity that exists to course correct.
    I have been clear in my intent: Congress can and must craft a

strengthens program operations to demand transparency and

of helping our neighbors in need, but doing so without indiscriminate 
expansion of our nutrition safety net.
    However, there remains significant headwinds to Congress' success.
    It is virtually impossible to create a robust and resilient farm

    The Chairman. And with that, I yield to my good friend and 
distinguished Ranking Member, Mr. Scott.

  OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DAVID SCOTT, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
                     CONGRESS FROM GEORGIA

    Mr. David Scott of Georgia. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, 
for holding this hearing today. And I certainly welcome our 
distinguished Secretary Vilsack. The very last time that 
Secretary Vilsack sat before this Committee as a witness in 
March of last year, I spoke of beginning the farm bill process 
in earnest. Now, nearly a year later, we are still working 
towards our shared goal of passing a strong, effective, and 
bipartisan farm bill. And I hope that the testimony of 
Secretary Vilsack will provide our Committee with the help in 
getting us closer to that shared goal.
    Changes in Republican leadership, potential government 
shutdowns, and the inability to pass the agriculture 
appropriations bill have each injected uncertainty into this 
process and, unfortunately, slowed our work. I do not envy you, 
Mr. Chairman. You are doing what you can to navigate these 
turbulent waters. And I want to give you credit. You have 
continued to meet and discuss policy priorities with me, with 
our House Agriculture Democrats, and our staff, and we 
appreciate that. To aid these efforts and reinforce that House 
Democrats want to get a farm bill done, we published our farm 
bill priorities and our principles last week. Our principles 
should not surprise anyone who has been following the work of 
this Committee.
    Our principles are this. We want to reduce hunger. Hunger 
is a serious problem in our nation. And we want to strengthen 
our American farmers. We are losing farms, particularly family 
farms, at a staggering rate. We want to invest in sustainable 
agriculture, revitalize rural America, lower costs for farmers 
and families, and improve equity. I know we can do this by 
working together because I know, Mr. Chairman, we have been 
together for quite a while on this Committee. And I know you 
care just as much as I do about our nation's farmers. And we 
work together on that, have been working together on that for 
many years. And I know we can do this by working together.
    So let's put aside, first and foremost, this proposal to 
cut SNAP benefits. Whether you call it a cut or a reduction of 
future benefits, Democrats oppose it. We will not cut SNAP. 
Now, I understand that my Republican colleagues are concerned 
about spending. Let me make a few points here. At least you are 
concerned about spending when it comes to SNAP. But because the 
economy has improved, benefits and need for the program has 
decreased. The CBO is now expecting SNAP to cost $67 billion 
less over the next decade than originally expected. That is 
important as we go into this negotiation.
    Let's also put aside the proposal to take IRA (Pub. L. 117-
169) conservation or energy funding away from its intended 
purpose. Robbing Peter to pay Paul is not going to result in an 
effective farm bill. These IRA programs are oversubscribed, so 
we should not take funding from them to pay for other farm bill 
priorities. We Democrats feel strongly about this.
    So let me close by saying that we do want a bipartisan 
bill. We want to see our bipartisan priorities funded, but we 
need to continue the funding process. We in agriculture need 
more funding, but we need also to continue to work together to 
find that funding. Over the past 20 years, bipartisan farm 
bills have succeeded when Republicans and Democratic leadership 
made the farm bill a priority and provided outside resources to 
the Agriculture Committee.
    I look forward to hearing from you, Mr. Secretary, and to 
working with my colleagues and my good friend, Chairman 
Thompson on building a bipartisan bill that strengthens our 
safety net programs for our farmers and the hungry families 
they feed. It is a tall task, but we are up to accomplishing 
it, and we can do it together.
    And please pardon my cold. I yield back.
    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman.
    The chair would request that other Members submit their 
opening statements for the record so our witness can begin his 
testimony and to ensure that there is ample time for questions.
    I am very, very pleased to welcome back to the Committee 
our witness for today, USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack. Mr. 
Secretary, thank you for joining us. We are now going to 
proceed your testimony. You will have 5 minutes. The timer in 
front of you will count down to zero, at which point your time 
has expired.
    Secretary Vilsack, please begin when you are ready.

    STATEMENT OF THOMAS ``TOM'' J. VILSACK, SECRETARY, U.S. 
          DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, WASHINGTON, D.C.

    Secretary Vilsack. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much to you 
and to the Ranking Member, Representative Scott. Thank you for 
the opportunity to be here today, And thanks to all Members of 
this Committee for their service.
    Mr. Chairman, I read with interest a recent article that 
you published in Agri-Pulse titled, It's Time to get Serious 
about Revitalizing Rural America. Your opening comments today 
summarized that article.
    I thought it would be helpful to perhaps put in context 
some of the information that I have that suggests that we are 
in fact serious about revitalizing rural America. First of all, 
let me begin by indicating that the last 3 years of net cash 
farm income were record-setting, the best 3 years in the last 
50 years in this country. This year's income projected at just 
below historical norms will make it the best 4 years in recent 
history. It has also allowed for our farmers to have 
significant liquidity as they deal with challenging times.
    Our rural unemployment rate is now at a lowest rate in 35 
years. Our rural employment has returned to pre-pandemic 
levels, and the clean energy jobs are helping to lead the way 
rural poverty is down. And in fact, in 55 counties that 
historically were persistently poor are no longer in that 
category because of activities and work being done in those 
counties to improve economic opportunity.
    For the first time in 10 years, rural populations have 
grown, more people coming into rural America than leaving. Real 
wage growth in 2023 exceeds inflation by nearly two percent. 
And speaking of inflation and food inflation, it is headed 
down. Grocery store price inflation year over year is at 1.3 
percent, the lowest it has been since 2021. And our Economic 
Research Service predicts that food-at-home prices will in fact 
decrease in 2024.
    I have several concerns that I want to share with the 
Committee. They have to do with the loss of farmers and farms, 
the loss of farmland, and the heavy concentration of farm 
income. In 1981, then-Secretary Bob Bergland raised concerns 
about the efforts and focus on production and its impact on the 
number of farms in this country. Since he raised that warning 
in 1981, we have lost 536,543 farms. We have lost over 165 
million acres of farmland. Now, to give you a sense of how many 
farmers that is, that is every farmer today in South Dakota, 
North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, 
Colorado, Oklahoma, and Missouri. The farmland represents all 
the landmass of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South 
Carolina, Maryland, and almost all of Virginia.
    Farm income has been extraordinarily concentrated with the 
top seven percent of farms, those who generate more than 
$500,000 in sales on an annual basis over the last 5 years 
getting 85 percent of the income, which meant that 93 percent 
of farms, nearly two million farms, had to share 15 percent. 
These are serious issues, and I think it is important for us to 
reset the notion that the only option in American agriculture 
is to get big or get out. It is time for us to do better for 
our small- and mid-sized farming operations, those 93 percent 
that share 15 percent of income that are surviving for the most 
part by taking a second job.
    I think we need to create for our farm families ways in 
which the farm, not the farmer, can create additional income. 
More new and better market opportunities and more income 
streams is a strategy that we are investing in at USDA, 
climate-smart agriculture and forestry commodities providing a 
value-added opportunity, as well as participation in ecosystem 
markets, a new income stream for farms; sustainable aviation 
fuel and other bioproduct manufacturing from agricultural 
waste, creating another commodity opportunity; renewable energy 
production not only to lower costs, but also to assist rural 
electric cooperatives as they transition from fossil fuel-based 
generation; new competitive meat and poultry markets with over 
400 investments already being made.
    And speaking of fertilizer, as you did in your comments, 
Mr. Chairman, I need to tell you that in four states we are in 
fact producing more fertilizer in Florida, Missouri, Alabama, 
and Montana. There are 40 projects that we have invested in, 
construction underway in the other 36, and there will be more 
coming.
    So, Mr. Chairman, I acknowledge the importance of the farm 
bill, but I think we also need a budget. We need the ability to 
utilize the Commodity Credit Corporation with flexibility, and 
we need to preserve the Inflation Reduction Act conservation 
funding. All of these are valuable tools in order to continue 
the momentum that has been building for markets, jobs, and 
better income for rural Americans and for our farm families.
    [The prepared statement of Secretary Vilsack follows:]

 Prepared Statement of Hon. Thomas ``Tom'' J. Vilsack, Secretary, U.S. 
              Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C.
    Thank you, Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member Scott, and Members of 
the Committee for the opportunity to come before you today to provide 
an update on the state of rural America, and the work the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) has been doing over the past 3 years 
of the Biden-Harris Administration.
    USDA's work touches every community, and nearly every landscape, 
across the entire country. The People's Department provides safety nets 
to farmers, nutrition assistance to some of our country's most 
vulnerable citizens, support for renewable clean energy, firefighters 
to keep our communities safe, food safety inspections--and much, much 
more. It is an honor to lead this department, and I am excited to share 
with you some of the progress we have made over the past 3 years to 
support America's farmers and ranchers, create opportunity in rural 
areas, improve USDA's processes and customer service, and protect 
forests and other natural resources. In order to capture that progress, 
it is important to discuss where we started at the beginning of this 
Administration, and then look at how far we have come.
    Every year, USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS) publishes a 
report called ``Rural America at A Glance.'' The Rural America at a 
Glance report published in November 2021 captured the state of rural 
America in late 2020 and early 2021, which of course was at the height 
of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, ERS wrote that people in rural 
or less densely populated areas might be less resilient than urban and 
suburban communities to shocks from the pandemic, and they could face 
greater challenges with recovery since they already experienced greater 
economic challenges accessing products, services, or commuting to work. 
Much of the report explored how a relative lack of broadband access in 
particular, and the prevalence of persistently poor communities among 
America's rural areas, might also contribute to the challenges these 
communities face during recovery. Of the 353 counties classified as 
experiencing persistent poverty at the time, 301 were in non-
metropolitan areas. In the months leading up to the pandemic, only 72 
percent of rural residents and only 63 percent of rural residents in 
persistent poverty counties had moderate- or high-speed broadband 
available in their census blocks, the report found.
    While the pandemic put rural challenges under a microscope in ways 
that made it easy to see exactly what needed to be addressed, these 
challenges predated COVID-19. The report noted that over the decade 
leading up to its publication, the rural population declined 0.6 
percent while the urban population grew 8.8 percent. The picture was 
much bleaker for rural counties with persistent poverty, whose 
populations declined by 5.7 percent. The report also noted that the 
average annual employment growth rate prior to the pandemic in rural 
areas was so low that rural America still had not recovered from the 
Great Recession by 2019. So, while unemployment remained somewhat 
steadier in rural areas compared to urban areas during the pandemic, 
ERS' outlook for rural America at the time of the report had not been 
hopeful for years due to longstanding systemic issues, and they did not 
predict a strong turnaround.
    However, the 2023 Rural America at a Glance report, published this 
past November, paints a much brighter picture. This report notes that 
the rural population is growing again after a decade of overall 
population loss, with growth of approximately \1/4\ percent from 2020 
to 2022. It also showed that rural employment levels and annual growth 
rates have nearly returned to those seen in the years prior to the 
pandemic. In particular, the emergence of the clean energy economy is a 
growing employment sector, with clean energy jobs employing more than 
243,000 workers in non-metropolitan counties in 2021, and those jobs 
have continued to grow through our investments since. The rural 
population is also experiencing a decline in poverty. In 2021, 9.7 
percent fewer non-metropolitan counties experienced persistent poverty 
(county-level poverty rates of 20 percent or higher over the last 30 
years) compared with a decade earlier.
    Certainly, these are not real-time statistics, nor is it possible 
to record all of the factors that contribute to improving circumstances 
in rural areas. Even so, we know that some factors are likely to have 
contributed and continue to do so in the period following what was 
captured in the latest report. First, net farm income has been at an 
all-time record high in recent years.
    Specifically, farm income over the 2021-2023 period represents the 
highest level of farm income in the last 50 years--with 2022 attaining 
a record high and net cash farm income for 2023 being one of the best 
years on record at 16 percent above average for the last 2 decades. We 
saw that the bulk of that income has been driven by the market, namely 
high commodity prices and the 3 highest years on record for 
agricultural exports, and not by farm safety net payments. And while 
the first farm income forecast of 2024 indicates net farm income this 
year will return to prior levels that are slightly below these historic 
levels for farm income, this forecast underscores the critical 
importance of USDA's ongoing work to help foster prosperity for 
producers and the communities they love by supporting an economy that 
grows from the bottom up and the middle out, and by creating new market 
opportunities that promote competition in the marketplace that can help 
combat low prices and high input costs. At the end of the day, a strong 
farm economy inarguably contributes to a strong rural economy and makes 
rural communities a more attractive place to live--and we are doing 
everything within our control to focus our efforts on enhancing 
economic resiliency.
    The historic years of farm income mirror the stronger economy that 
President Biden and his economic team have advanced coming out of the 
pandemic; the U.S. economy grew 3.1 percent over the past year while 
adding 2.9 million jobs and with core inflation moving back down to the 
pre-pandemic benchmark over the last 6 months. And thanks to strong 
wage gains and higher job growth than expected, more families are 
benefitting. As a result, our policies have contributed to wages, 
wealth, and employment that are higher now than they were before the 
pandemic. This is just a snapshot of the steady improvement we have 
seen under this Administration, with the economy adding 14.8 million 
jobs overall with 2 full years of unemployment under four percent.
    Another factor benefitting rural communities is an unprecedented 
investment to improve and modernize infrastructure. From water and 
waste treatment to electric power and telecommunications services to 
modernized schools and hospitals, the Biden-Harris Administration and 
USDA have been laser-focused on bringing rural community infrastructure 
and services into the 21st century. Since the beginning of this 
Administration, we have also been able to connect nearly 600,000 people 
across 35 states and territories to high-speed internet. This much-
needed infrastructure is improving the quality of rural life and making 
it possible for more people to enjoy the beauty of rural America.
    Despite this good news, we are all aware that systemic challenges 
remain, and we have yet to see rural areas reach their full potential. 
Rural poverty has declined in most, but not all, rural counties. Food 
insecurity also remains more common in rural areas than suburban areas.
    And, even with higher farm income, farming still remains an 
incredibly risky business. Given tightening conditions and high 
interest rates, compounded with rising production costs, it is 
increasingly difficult for some farms to be able to meet short-term 
debt commitments. We also know that over half of farm households had 
negative farm income, and 84 percent of farm families obtain the 
majority of their income from off the farm.
    Over the past several decades our economy has been focused on 
efficiency and productivity with businesses across the spectrum--
manufacturing, retail, services, technology, agriculture--
consolidating. Case in point, U.S. agriculture policy has, 
counterintuitively, encouraged a system that inherently shrinks 
opportunity, rather than grows it. The ``get big or get out'' paradigm 
established under Secretary Butz in the 1970s instructed bigger farms 
to expand, and the consolidation that followed significantly reduced 
the viability of small- and mid-sized farming operations. All farmers 
strive to be efficient, but our current system supports production of 
limited crops at an enormous scale. That kind of system demands a need 
for bigger farms, but fewer farmers. This concept of shrinking 
opportunity isn't theoretical--it's proven. Since 1981, we have lost 
437,000 farms and 141 million acres of farmland--that's equivalent to 
the landmass of Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, and South 
Carolina combined.
    Having fewer farmers predictably has led to high concentration of 
income. Despite record-breaking farm income, in recent years, typically 
about seven percent of U.S. farms receive 85 percent of overall farm 
income, which means the remaining 93 percent of our farms share only 15 
percent of farm income. On top of this, farmers are receiving less of 
the food dollar today than ever before.
    It is clear that we are at a pivotal moment today, where we have 
the ability to choose a more expansive set of options to create, not 
diminish, opportunity. USDA is using the American Rescue Plan Act 
(ARPA), Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), and Inflation Reduction 
Act (IRA), as well as the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), to take a 
comprehensive approach to create opportunity for rural communities and 
invest in farmers, ranchers, and small businesses. While some of these 
investments are still nascent, we are beginning to see the fruits of 
this expansive policy framework that adds value for farms of every 
shape and every size and is designed for the real needs of rural 
America.
    The Biden-Harris Administration's historic investments in 
infrastructure and new market opportunities have provided USDA with a 
powerful set of tools for restructuring our food and agriculture 
economy so small- and mid-sized producers get a fair shake, catalyzing 
strong rural economies where people have the opportunity and tools they 
need to build a good life in the communities they love.
    Through the President's Investing in America agenda, we are 
supporting projects to lower input costs for rural producers and 
businesses, which increases their net income and improves their bottom 
line. In 2023, we provided funding for projects that will help farmers 
and rural small businesses reduce their energy costs--in some cases up 
to 100 percent--with over 2,000 investments totaling over $397 million, 
most of which were made possible by IRA funding for the Rural Energy 
for America Program (REAP). We also began addressing the strain placed 
on producers by higher fertilizer costs driven by Russia's war of 
aggression against the people of Ukraine thanks to the flexibility 
offered by the CCC. For example, a grant in Wisconsin is helping a 
dairy farm convert manure to fertilizer through the construction of a 
nutrient concentration system that reduces greenhouse gas emissions. We 
are investing $900 million in solutions like these to increase, or 
otherwise expand, the manufacturing and processing of fertilizer and 
nutrient alternatives in the United States. In a short period of time, 
USDA has already announced $166 million in investments to 40 American 
companies, with many more to come.
    We are also giving producers new options to manage their land and 
creating new, climate-focused markets. With funding made available 
through the IRA, USDA has enrolled more farmers in voluntary 
conservation programs than at any point in history. In 2023, USDA 
enrolled nearly 5,300 additional producers in conservation programs and 
awarded 5,287 IRA applications for a total of $391 million. Even with 
those awards, the agency still had 5,986 applications on hand going 
into this Fiscal Year 2024. In our core farm bill programs, we're also 
seeing great producer interest. Since 2021, the Grassland Conservation 
Reserve Program (CRP) has enrolled a historic 6.8 million acres on over 
10,000 farms. These programs are supporting farmers, important stewards 
of our land, in the work they are doing to provide productive and 
sustainable lands.
    USDA is also increasing market opportunities for producers to sell 
their products. We are strengthening local and regional food systems 
and providing producers with more options to market their products. 
USDA invested millions to help businesses stay in operation or build 
new processing capacity in 2023 as part of the Biden-Harris 
Administration's $1 billion commitment to expand meat and poultry 
processing capacity for small- and mid-sized processors. Because of 
investments like these, a company in Bidwell, Ohio will be able to 
increase their processing facility by 50 percent, and another company 
in Mills County, Iowa will expand processing capacity by 1,500 head of 
cattle per day and employ up to 800 workers. Through the Meat and 
Poultry Processing Expansion Program and the Meat and Poultry 
Intermediary Lending Program, USDA has awarded funding to 66 entities 
across the country, creating 4,207 jobs and increasing processing 
capacity by 337,770 shackle spaces.
    USDA has also capitalized on its role as a major food buyer. In 
Fiscal Year 2023, 63 percent of USDA's purchases for domestic nutrition 
programs came from small businesses. This is an increase of eight 
percent over Fiscal Year 2022. With this increase, USDA is creating 
more opportunities to bolster rural communities, support small 
businesses, and connect small- and mid-sized farmers to new markets. 
USDA signed Local Food Procurement Agreements with 50 states, 35 
Tribes, and three territories to purchase local food for food banks, 
schools, and other nutrition assistance programs. One such agreement in 
Oklahoma is identifying and reaching out to underserved producers to 
provide them with an opportunity to distribute their food to local 
underserved communities, helping to expand economic development for 
both the producers and communities they serve. These programs create 
jobs, lower costs for consumers, and help farmers and ranchers attain 
fairer prices by giving them options closer to the farm and making our 
food supply chain more resilient. They also complement the important 
role USDA plays in reducing hunger and promoting health through our 
full suite of Federal nutrition assistance programs. From rural areas 
to cities and towns across the country, USDA reached one in four 
Americans with healthy food, nutrition education, and other related 
resources in 2023.
    And for the rural Americans who do not have the tools to take 
advantage of these opportunities, this Administration launched the 
Rural Partners Network, which brings a whole of government approach to 
delivering technical assistance and resources. This allows us to lift 
up rural communities with a focused approach and ensure the people who 
are looking to take advantage of these opportunities are able. Through 
Rural Development programs such as ReConnect and Emergency Rural Health 
Care Grants we are expanding access to high-speed internet and helping 
rural communities maintain access to healthcare, two critical resources 
for thriving rural communities. In 2023 alone, USDA helped more than 
250,000 people in rural communities access affordable, high-speed 
internet benefitting over 11,000 farms, 7,300 rural businesses, and 
nearly 500 educational facilities. Additionally, thanks to 806 grants 
provided to health care institutions under this Administration, more 
than 22 million people have greater access to health care and 
nutrition, which is critical for not only emergency needs but also to 
ensure access to primary care, rehabilitation, and long-term care for 
millions of Americans.
    We are also working hard to bring a whole of USDA approach to 
address other systemic issues, such as lack of equity and inclusiveness 
in our programs, to make USDA a great place to work and to do business. 
USDA's Equity Commission has made recommendations that are informing 
USDA's policy decisions so that the Department's programs, services, 
and decisions reflect the values of equity and inclusion. We 
acknowledge we have not done enough to provide all farmers and ranchers 
an equal chance of success and prosperity and are actively working to 
change that. As of the beginning of this month, USDA has helped more 
than 37,000 farmers and ranchers who were in financial distress stay on 
their farms and keep farming, thanks to resources provided through 
Section 22006 of the IRA. At the same time, under the guidance of our 
Deputy Secretary, USDA has modernized its processes. For example, we 
have greatly improved the Farm Service Agency's (FSA) loan application 
processes to better serve farmers, in part through lessons learned from 
Farm Loan Borrower Relief Program implementation. USDA has streamlined 
FSA loan applications from 29 pages to 13, dramatically reducing the 
amount of time it takes to apply for a loan and making the process less 
onerous. In addition, in December 2023, USDA announced an online, 
interactive, guided application that can simplify the direct loan 
process for the more than 26,000 customers who apply each year and make 
it more accessible for those in remote areas or who may not have time 
to leave their operations and visit an FSA office. We have also 
recently added the option for FSA borrowers to make payments on their 
loans online and will continue to modernize our systems to make it 
easier for producers to manage their loans and time. Additionally, we 
are also making great progress in rebuilding our workforce. USDA 
agencies have increased their use of recruitment and retention 
incentives to bring pay more in line with market levels. As a result, 
more candidates are accepting job offers--and we are especially proud 
of how well this is working with pathways hires at FSA and the Natural 
Resource Conservation Service (NRCS).
    If we are going to create an agriculture system that works for the 
many and the most, I believe the answer is a holistic approach. Not one 
focused just on bushels per acre, but one that also measures success as 
rural families being able to pay their bills, preserving our lands, and 
making their communities a place our children and grandchildren can 
call home. Producers of all kinds should be able to make a living and 
support their families through farming, not just those with the biggest 
operations. As decision makers in USDA and Congress, we should use the 
market, climate-based tools, and food systems to create new income 
opportunities and value for producers and rural communities.
    I welcome this opportunity to discuss these important issues with 
you further and help you learn more about the great successes and 
progress we have seen in the last year. In turn, I urge you to bear in 
mind that we have a choice before us. We can continue on the path that 
this Administration has taken that leads to an even better and stronger 
rural America, or we can hold tight to the old model and continue a 
system that limits opportunities for producers and rural communities. 
At this critical moment, are you okay with losing another 400,000 farms 
in the next 30 years? What would it take to ensure our young people can 
see a future for themselves in agriculture and in rural America? I 
worry that turning back will further entrench consolidation, fragile 
food supply chains, nutrition insecurity, and high barriers to entry 
into agriculture. It will also likely perpetuate trends we are already 
seeing, including loss of farmland, and generational poverty. Together, 
we can tackle these critical issues and create a healthy, equitable, 
and sustainable food system that strengthens our farms and our rural 
communities for generations to come.

    The Chairman. Secretary Vilsack, thank you for your 
important testimony today.
    At this time, Members will be recognized for questions in 
the order of seniority, alternating between Majority and 
Minority Members and in order of arrival for those who joined 
us after the hearing convened. You will be recognized for 5 
minutes each in order to allow us to get to as many questions 
as possible.
    And I will recognize myself for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Secretary, I wanted to talk on a specific issue or 
question a specific issue to begin with that fits in the topic 
of regulations and the cost that they impose on both farmers 
and consumers. So let's talk about Prop 12. Mr. Secretary, you 
and I have discussed this issue. Preliminary data from a 
pending study at USDA's Office of the Chief Economist shows 
that prices of certain pork products have risen as much as 41 
percent since the implementation of Proposition 12. A 2023 
study found that the costs associated with Prop 12 are, quote, 
``widespread and extensive,'' end quote. That same study 
expressed that, quote, ``These costs have a more severe impact 
on smaller independent operations, and that distresses placed 
upon the entire production and marketing chain will lead to 
ever-increasing consolidation and concentration of the 
industry,'' end quotes.
    Now, we appreciate that the Biden Administration sided with 
the industry during the Supreme Court case. As we all know, the 
Supreme Court has weighed in on this matter and asked Congress 
to act. When thinking about the stated goals of this 
Administration in your very own testimony to serve small 
producers, can you speak to the economic harms from Proposition 
12? And, quite frankly, if pork prices are going up for 
consumers and costs are going up for producers, who is winning 
here?
    Secretary Vilsack. Mr. Chairman, I don't want to take you 
all the way back in our history, but I am going to, in response 
to your question to the Articles of Confederation. If you 
remember, when we began as a republic, we had basically a 
theory and structure that states would basically govern their 
own activities within their borders. What we found after 
several years of that experiment was chaos. And I think, 
frankly, that is where we are potentially headed.
    The reality is this, that when each state has the ability 
to define for itself and for its consumers exactly what farming 
techniques or practices are appropriate, it does create the 
possibility of 50 different sets of rules and regulations, 
which obviously creates serious concerns for producers because 
they have no stability, and they have no certainty.
    I am not sure that this Congress is going to be able to 
pass legislation, with due respect. But I would suggest that if 
we don't take this issue seriously, we are going to have chaos 
in the marketplace because there is nothing preventing any 
state from doing what California did.
    Now, why did the Supreme Court decide what they decided? 
They decided it because they believed that each and every 
producer had their own choice to participate in this market. 
They basically said it didn't violate the commerce clause 
because it didn't discriminate against any particular producer. 
Well, the problem, I think, is that it didn't anticipate the 
impact of 12 percent of the market changing the rules on the 
entire market. And I think that there is risk of that occurring 
all across the country.
    Having said that, it is a little bit difficult, however, to 
create consistency within this Congress and within this country 
on this issue of states' rights, because if you apply this 
standard, then you are going to have to discuss some of the 
more difficult issues, social issues, guns, abortion, et 
cetera. So I don't envy the Congress trying to figure this out. 
I will tell you, though, that if Congress doesn't figure it 
out, there is going to be chaos.
    The Chairman. Yes, I know, hearing from smaller producers, 
the larger producers that were prepared to go into that market 
have found that the volume that they prepared for is not there 
in California, so they are dumping product into other states, 
crowding out small producers. There is a lot of implication.
    Mr. Secretary, in your testimony and comments around the 
country, you often lament about farms getting larger, about how 
many are forced to get big or get out. And I will be frank. I, 
too, share this concern, but not because of the concentration 
of farm income amongst these operations, but because of the 
concentration of risk borne by these full-time family farms. 
They have been forced into achieving economies-of-scale to be 
able to survive or to grow large enough for the next generation 
to have room to return to the family farm. These farms might 
have more to gain when times are good, but they also have more 
to lose when times are bad, which is why we need to make sure 
the safety net works for them, too.
    Unfortunately, you have taken it upon yourself to utilize 
USDA to transform American agriculture through the unfettered 
use of the CCC or rewriting the rules on disaster aid programs 
to reorient assistance to small and part-time farmers at the 
expense of the full-time family farms. The truth is much of the 
consolidation you lament is a direct result of costs that are 
constantly rising amid softening commodity prices, putting the 
squeeze on margins.
    And when I travel the country and talk to producers, many 
of the additional costs they are bearing are a direct result of 
the actions taken by this Administration. Between Department of 
Labor rules that have made the H-2A program almost unworkable 
and driven up the cost of labor, the EPA's war on crop 
protection tools, or even the threat of financial regulations 
that will increase cost of banking. As the Biden Administration 
is contributing to the expansion of these farming operations, 
many decisions with the aim of transforming any sector of the 
American economy is not the role of unelected bureaucrats, Mr. 
Secretary, but rather, those ideas should be debated in 
Congress, and no amount of tinkering around the edges at USDA 
will stop that.
    Seeing that my time has expired, I now recognize----
    Secretary Vilsack. Mr. Chairman, can I have a minute to 
respond to that please?
    The Chairman. Yes, sir.
    Secretary Vilsack. First of all, you mentioned the CCC. I 
just want you to know that we have basically followed the 
charter that was established by Congress in the establishment 
of the CCC. And we have not, as was the case in the previous 
Administration, jeopardized the capacity of that fund to be 
able to do its farm bill payments.
    Second, you mentioned the disaster assistance program. I 
would just simply say, when we advised Congress that there was 
a $10-$12 billion bill due to assist producers across the board 
for disasters in 2022, Congress appropriated $3 billion. You 
gave us 30 percent of what we needed. So we had a choice of 
basically doing it the way we did before when we had all the 
money and the resources to be able to cover all of the 
producers, or provide an opportunity for 80 percent of the 
producers to receive slightly more. This included those family 
farmers you just talked about.
    So if I had to do it over again, I would do it the same way 
because I think it is helpful to help those smaller producers. 
Why? Because they didn't receive the lion's share of the $19 
billion of indemnification that was paid through crop insurance 
and other mechanisms.
    So with all due respect, if you want the disaster programs 
to work, then we have to have the resources to be able to do 
what you want us to do, which is to make everybody whole.
    The Chairman. And, Mr. Secretary, I appreciate that. In the 
great times that we have spent meeting together, I will just 
reinforce what I have said before. Work with us on those 
issues. I can't control what happened in the past. I couldn't 
even control what happened in 2022, but I did have more 
opportunity today as Chairman.
    So with that, I recognize the Ranking Member for his 
questions.
    Mr. David Scott of Georgia. Thank you, Chairman Thompson. I 
really appreciate that.
    Secretary Vilsack, both my Democratic and Republican 
colleagues certainly want to pass a bipartisan farm bill. And 
the year's extension is giving us more time to work out our 
differences, and we are negotiating through those now. But I 
know that Chairman Thompson and I feel the same about this. We 
definitely want a bipartisan farm bill.
    I hear from my nation's farmers quite regularly that they 
want and need certainty. They want and they need new markets. 
And in that regard, I want to thank you for creating RAPP. And 
RAPP means Regional Agriculture Promotion Programs. It helps 
our commodities farmers, and certainly, it helps groups like 
our soybean farmers and others to be able to navigate the 
challenges we are facing today.
    And for those of you who may be listening to this hearing 
across the nation, Secretary Vilsack, could you share with us 
and the nation your thoughts on this, why a bipartisan bill 
passed this year is very vital and very important and why it 
has got to be done?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, Representative Scott, I think it 
is fair to say that every farmer, every rancher, and everyone 
who lives in rural America depends in large part on the farm 
bill programs. A farm bill is more than that. It is a rural 
development bill. It is a conservation bill. It is a nutrition 
bill. It is a research bill. It is a trade bill. It is a risk 
management bill. It is a broad opportunity to say to rural 
America and to American agriculture that we care, that we are 
investing in their future, and we are providing stability.
    The failure to have a farm bill creates uncertainty, and 
that uncertainty makes it very difficult for producers to make 
decisions about their operations, to decide whether or not they 
are going to diversify their crop, to decide whether or not 
they are going to take advantage of new crop insurance. By the 
way, we have had 12 new policies and 15 new modifications to 
crop insurance just in the last 3 years. Do they take advantage 
of those or not?
    It is very difficult for land-grant universities, minority-
serving institutions that rely on the direction of the farm 
bill and the Research Title to know whether or not they can 
move forward with critical research, which obviously will 
impact and affect things. It is difficult for those in the 
Chamber of Commerce and economic development offices across the 
counties to know whether or not they need to plan for new 
opportunities. I mean, the bottom line is we have to get it 
done.
    Mr. David Scott of Georgia. Right. Let me get to another 
question which is very important. Mr. Vilsack, I know you 
testified to your commitment to getting IRA dollars out the 
door so our farmers and rural communities can benefit from 
these investments, and I want to applaud you for those efforts 
and dedication. But can you give us an update on where things 
stand?
    Secretary Vilsack. Yes, 99.8 percent of the money that was 
set out in the IRA for 2023 was obligated. EQIP, 2,812 
landowners received contracts, nearly 8,000 applications. The 
easement program, 69 producers received assistance, 250 
applications.
    Mr. David Scott of Georgia. Yes, my time is getting a bit 
short here. Let me also ask you, did you meet your spending 
goals last year?
    Secretary Vilsack. Absolutely, because the goal was to get 
the money out the door.
    Mr. David Scott of Georgia. And are you on target to spend 
all you have planned for this year?
    Secretary Vilsack. Yes, because the demand is there.
    Mr. David Scott of Georgia. And are you still hiring more 
staff, or has hiring plateaued?
    Secretary Vilsack. Because of the money and resources in 
the IRA, we are able to continue to increase NRCS, over 1,500 
new people working in NRCS. And we have expanded through 
technical assistance, cooperative agreements, additional help, 
and assistance.
    Mr. David Scott of Georgia. Thank you. And I just want to 
personally thank you for the great work you have done with me 
and many of the Members on this Committee and making sure our 
1890s Student Scholarship Program is now permanent, and it 
passed in a very strong bipartisan way into the farm bill, and 
we are making that scholarship permanent. Hopefully, that 
addresses some of the concerns that you expressed about making 
sure that we have farmers for generations to come. Thank you.
    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman and now recognize the 
distinguished gentleman, the Chairman emeritus from Oklahoma, 
Mr. Lucas, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Lucas. Which is a polite way of saying the old guy.
    Welcome, Mr. Secretary. And kind of in that role, you have 
had an outstanding career, too. You have been Secretary, what, 
10 of the last 14 years?
    Secretary Vilsack. Going on 11.
    Mr. Lucas. Going on 11, that is pretty amazing to have been 
around that long in what sometimes is a challenging agency 
directing policy, so your imprint is in a lot of places. And I 
am impressed, and I congratulate you for that. And I know that 
every Administration is different. The Obama Administration is 
certainly different than the Trump Administration. And in some 
ways the Biden Administration is different even than the Obama 
or Trump Administrations.
    But that said, Mr. Secretary, it has always been clear to 
me that the strongest policies that come out of this Committee 
and the most important programs administered by USDA are built 
on the belief that support and relief programs must be tied to 
crop production. When this Committee or your agency stray from 
that principle, we begin to walk down an unsustainable and a 
very concerning path.
    When you last appeared before this Committee, I raised 
concerns about your agency's design and implementation of phase 
two of the Emergency Relief Program for 2021 crop year and 
called for a return to the ERP phase one methodology. You said 
that your agency would learn from their experiences during the 
first iteration of ERP and would factor it into the 
administration of the next. Well, based on the reports that I 
am hearing from my producers in Oklahoma, ERP 2022 has proven 
to be no better than its predecessor at delivering support to 
those who suffered the greatest crop losses.
    So my question to you today is exactly where those lessons 
your agency learned from the administration of 2021 ERP 
program--what were those lessons, and how did it change the 
approach in 2022? And while you are thinking about that, as a 
follow-up, what did your agency learn from the ERP 2022 
rollout? And what are some of the changes that we can expect to 
see in future programs administered?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, one change would be for Congress 
to give us the resources we asked for. I mean, when you give us 
30 percent of what we ask for, when we tell you that that the 
damages are $10-$12 billion and you basically appropriate $3 
billion, you put us in a tough spot.
    Mr. Lucas. But, Mr. Secretary, when you change the program 
so that you screw up the delivery and screw up the 30 percent, 
it makes it difficult to come back and ask for the other 70.
    Secretary Vilsack. It didn't screw up at all. In fact, 82 
percent of producers received more assistance and help than 
they would have based on what you have articulated.
    Mr. Lucas. But my producers back home who actually raise 
the food and fiber that feed the country, who put the resources 
on the shelf that the Federal credit cards, the SNAP program 
benefits buy, tell me the resources are not going to production 
where the losses were.
    Secretary Vilsack. That is not true. That is not true. In 
fact, I will be happy to provide you the specific numbers of 
producers in your state that receive benefits in major 
commodity production.
    Mr. Lucas. But, Mr. Secretary, is the goal to give 
resources to address the disasters by following production, or 
is the goal to pick out who is actually farming so that those 
of a preferred category in the rules benefit more from disaster 
relief than others?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, Representative, you can't 
basically cherry-pick one program. You have to look at it in 
the totality. When you look at all of the resources that your 
producers received, including the crop insurance payments, the 
majority of which went to the people you are talking about, 
which is a very small subset of the producers that we are 
talking about.
    Mr. Lucas. I know, Mr. Secretary, what my producers are 
telling me. Let's change subjects for just a moment. I 
understand that there is discussion about USDA's Direct and 
Guaranteed Loan Programs so that there has been some discussion 
that Congress should for the first time authorize the 
conversion of guaranteed loans to direct loans based primarily 
on a decision by the Secretary that such loans are distressed. 
What would your approach be to ensuring that such conversions 
would be, I will say, rare and limited?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I can assure you that we are going 
to--whatever we do with this effort will not jeopardize the 
financial stability of our loan portfolio.
    Mr. Lucas. But the tradition of this Committee and policy 
has been that the guaranteed loans caused financial 
institutions to put skin in the game, that there was 
potentially a higher standard and a greater degree of potential 
success in the programs by going the guaranteed route as 
opposed to direct loans. If we simply shift bad direct loans--
sorry, bad guaranteed loans over to direct loans, one, we are 
bailing out banks; and two, we are disincentivizing being 
cautious and prudent loan officers.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I think the goal of any effort 
would be to try to keep farmers on the land. I think that is 
the key here. We are not trying to kick folks off the land. We 
want to keep them on the land if at all possible.
    Mr. Lucas. But, Mr. Secretary, we should not create 
situations where people will not be able to succeed and fail. 
That is terrible thing to do to fix.
    Secretary Vilsack. Fair enough, but that is not who we are 
talking about.
    Mr. Lucas. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman.
    I now recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. Costa, 
for 5 minutes of questioning.
    Mr. Costa. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, Ranking 
Member, and Members of the Committee. Mr. Secretary, it is 
always good to have you here.
    And clearly, we are focused on the reauthorization of the 
farm bill. We do it every 5 years. It equals a reestablishment 
of our priorities in terms of ensuring that America's safety 
net for the production of food and fiber with farmers, 
ranchers, dairymen and -women, and our farmworkers, as well as 
those who are food-insecure, benefit from that safety net.
    Let me just speak that in California, obviously, the 
largest agricultural state where over half the nation's fruits 
and nuts and vegetables are produced, 20 percent of the dairy 
products, 400 different commodities, this farm bill is critical 
and it is important. We must get this done this year.
    Investments made, though, in the previous Congress, I 
think, are critical to note. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 
(Pub. L. 117-58), the Inflation Reduction Act are all key 
funding methodologies that help America's agriculture economy. 
In California, as an example, over $1.15 billion for improved 
water storage in the San Joaquin Valley, $500 million to 
prepare aging dams and ensure safety, $1 billion for rural 
water projects, $56 million for Regional Conservation 
Partnership programs.
    But I want to talk about specifically, Mr. Secretary, the 
importance of these investments. I have heard that the previous 
President, who is running again, if reelected wants to impose 
ten percent tariffs across the board and 60 percent tariffs on 
Chinese goods. Given our importance of exporting agricultural 
products, I think this will just go back to resulting in a 
trade war. Would you care to comment on this and the pending 
impacts?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I don't think there is any 
question that the last time tariffs were assessed and the way 
they were assessed, they caused great stress in the 
countryside, significant impact on the market. Thirty percent 
of our product is sold in exports, and a significant percentage 
of that goes to China.
    Mr. Costa. Well, and everybody has leverage when you start 
a tariff war.
    Secretary Vilsack. I am sorry, what?
    Mr. Costa. Everybody has leverage when you start a tariff 
war.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, absolutely. And that is one of the 
reasons why the CCC was drained because you basically----
    Mr. Costa. Right, $45 billion under the previous 
Administration, I think you have spent $15 billion by 
comparison, right?
    Secretary Vilsack. That is correct. That is correct.
    Mr. Costa. Let me move on to the disaster relief. You 
talked about 30 percent and the supplemental appropriations. 
What would you like us to do going forward? Because the $2.8 
billion or you said $3 billion in disaster aid obviously didn't 
cover the disasters in 2023. What recommendation would you make 
for the future budget and the reauthorization of the farm bill?
    Secretary Vilsack. Two recommendations, one adequately and 
fully fund disaster assistance if it is ad hoc. Two----
    Mr. Costa. That is the bottom line, isn't it?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, it is a lot of money, but it is 
important to----
    Mr. Costa. But if you want to provide the disaster relief, 
you have to provide the funding?
    Secretary Vilsack. That is correct. That is correct. You 
have to provide the full money. And then second, I think it is 
important to have a conversation about how to create a 
structure and system that is less ad hoc and more permanent 
from a disaster assistance program. I think, Mr. Chairman, I 
think you are interested in doing that, and I think there is 
some logic and some reason for that discussion.
    Mr. Costa. And the Inflation Reduction Act--and I believe 
that those monies have gone for good purposes under the Natural 
Resources Conservation Services, as you pointed out, to a 
number of programs that, frankly, are oversubscribed. But there 
was some talk about taking those funds and putting them for 
other purposes. What would the Administration's view be on the 
farm reauthorization measure?
    Secretary Vilsack. We feel very strongly that you got to 
maintain those resources because of the demand and because the 
resources that are available to all farms, not to a subset of 
our American agriculture. It is important for us to continue to 
invest in conservation, and it is very, very evident that the 
countryside wants these resources because, as you indicated, 
they are significantly oversubscribed.
    Mr. Costa. Oftentimes under the USDA, the forestry title 
gets, I think, overlooked with climate change and the impacts 
of fires throughout the West. The importance of reauthorization 
of the farm bill and addressing the hazardous fuels reduction--
and we have a bipartisan bill that would save our sequoias. 
What is your focus on how we deal with this challenge that we 
have in forests across the country?
    Secretary Vilsack. The Congress made a good down payment in 
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which is allowing us to 
focus on hazardous fuel reduction in the West in particular.
    Mr. Costa. But we need to do more?
    Secretary Vilsack. It is a down payment. You need to 
continue to fund that effort.
    Mr. Costa. Okay. My time has expired. There is an issue in 
climate-smart partnerships, and I want you to continue to focus 
on that. It benefits a lot of individual folks that are 
participating in that climate-smart effort. I yield back the 
balance of my time.
    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman and now recognize Mr. 
Austin Scott from Georgia for 5 minutes of questioning.
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. Secretary Vilsack, you were 
the Secretary in 2010, correct?
    Secretary Vilsack. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. And in 2010, SNAP was 
approximately 67 percent of USDA funding, and 33 percent of 
USDA funding went to other sources, whether it be farming 
commodity production or conservation. Is that correct?
    Secretary Vilsack. I don't have those specific numbers, but 
I am sure that you do, Congressman, so I will acknowledge----
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. Well, thank you. And so, as I 
understand it today--and I expect you will have these numbers--
that approximately 80 percent would go to SNAP and 
approximately 20 percent would go to all of the other 
expenditures of USDA. Is that correct?
    Secretary Vilsack. I don't know whether that is correct or 
not, Congressman, but I will----
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. You are kidding me.
    Secretary Vilsack. For the sake of this conversation----
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. You are the Secretary of 
Agriculture, and you don't know what the pie chart of your 
budget looks like?
    Secretary Vilsack. I don't know the specific--I know that a 
significant percentage of our budget is focused on nutrition 
assistance of a multitude of different programs. It is not just 
SNAP, it is also WIC, it is the School Lunch Program, it is the 
assistance of food----
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. I am talking about food and 
nutritional programs being 80 percent.
    Secretary Vilsack. Okay. Well, that is more than SNAP.
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. And food nutritional programs 
were included in the 67 percent before.
    Secretary Vilsack. Okay.
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. Okay. But you understand what 
I am getting at?
    Secretary Vilsack. Sure. Yes, absolutely.
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. So that leaves 20 percent 
instead of 33 percent for conservation, production agriculture, 
all the other things that the USDA does, just simple math. Less 
than ten percent of your total USDA funding now is going to go 
to production agriculture. Is that correct?
    Secretary Vilsack. Congressman, I don't know if that is 
correct or not. What is the point? Just get to your point.
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. Well, my question for you is 
what percentage of what you receive at the USDA should actually 
go to production agriculture? My point is you talk about the 
loss of the family farm where starving farmers don't get to 
plant the food to feed hungry people.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, the reality is it is not about 
planting food. We are doing a great job of that. American 
farmers are the best in the world with that. We have seen a 
remarkable increase in productivity with inputs basically 
maintaining and actually there is wonderful----
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. Secretary, let me read 
something to you from a----
    Secretary Vilsack.--chart today right here that shows the 
productivity.
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. Well, it is my time, so let me 
read this to you from a good, good farmer. This isn't someone 
that inherited. This is someone who built their own family 
farm. ``This year reminds me a lot of the early 1980s. I had a 
bit more optimism in my 20s than in my 60s, making plans on 
which piece of land to sell off and get stable for the bumpy 
ride for agriculture.''
    Secretary Vilsack. We had record income in the last 3 
years, Congressman. We had record income. But the problem is--
--
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. No, sir, you did not.
    Secretary Vilsack.--that the income was concentrated.
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. 2021 and 2022 were good, but 
2023 was bad. You have glossed over----
    Secretary Vilsack. No, it wasn't----
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia.--the 2023 number.
    Secretary Vilsack. No, no. No, no. It was not bad. It was 
actually above the historic average. The 3 years total----
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. It was a significant fall-
off----
    Secretary Vilsack. Best 3 years in 50 years for sure. I 
think the best years from a net cash income ever, so----
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. Secretary Vilsack, have you 
talked talk to any farmers about----
    Secretary Vilsack. I have talked to more famers----
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia.--how much fertilizer costs, 
about how much----
    Secretary Vilsack.--than you have, sir.
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia.--diesel costs, about the cost 
of land rent because of what you have----
    Secretary Vilsack. Net cash farm----
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia.--done with solar subsidies and 
everything else?
    Secretary Vilsack.--income, highest ever, highest ever. The 
problem is it is concentrated in the hands of the large 
operators. And I have nothing against production agriculture 
and large operators. We need them. The question is, what are we 
doing about the other----
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. Secretary Vilsack----
    Secretary Vilsack.--the other 93 percent?
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. Secretary Vilsack, 
approximately 90 percent of the food supply comes from about 
ten percent of the farms in this country.
    Secretary Vilsack. I don't think that is quite accurate, 
but go ahead.
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. Well, what would you say was 
accurate with it?
    Secretary Vilsack. I think it is in the neighborhood of 85 
percent or so.
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. Eighty-five percent then comes 
from ten percent of the farms? That is 85 percent of the food 
supply for the American citizens.
    Secretary Vilsack. And they----
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. Now, your President and your 
Vice President don't seem to mind being dependent on foreign 
sources of energy, but I can assure you, the American citizens 
don't want to be dependent on foreign sources of food.
    Secretary Vilsack. Congressman, they are your----
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. We don't. And we are 
importing----
    Secretary Vilsack.--President and Vice President as well.
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia.--more food than we ever have 
in this country.
    Secretary Vilsack. We are producing more oil than any other 
country in the world. What are you talking about?
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. We are importing more food. We 
are importing more food----
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, you--no, no, no. Nope, nope, nope, 
wait a minute. Wait a minute. Let's be----
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia.--than we ever have in this 
country.
    Secretary Vilsack. Let's be clear about this. Let's be 
clear about what we are importing, okay? The major driver of 
the imports: horticulture. Horticulture, okay?
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. We are importing more food----
    Secretary Vilsack. And we are----
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia.--than we ever have in the 
history of the country.
    Secretary Vilsack. We are importing it because we like to 
have choice all year long. It is not that we are importing it 
because we need it to feed ourselves.
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. Secretary Vilsack, you can 
justify the actions all----
    Secretary Vilsack. But it is true.
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia.--all you want to.
    Secretary Vilsack. It is----
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. Have you been to the grocery 
store lately?
    Secretary Vilsack. Absolutely.
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. What does food cost today 
versus what it did before the American Rescue Plan and the 
Inflation Reduction Act, as you call it?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, the good news is--and I alluded to 
it----
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. There is no good news there.
    Secretary Vilsack. Food inflation is down. Grocery store 
price inflation year over year is 1.3 percent, the lowest it 
has been since 2021, and ERS predicts that it is going to 
decrease this year in 2024.
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. If it falls another 25 
percent, it will be back where it was before y'all got there.
    The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired.
    Now I am pleased to recognize the gentleman from 
Massachusetts, Mr. McGovern, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. McGovern. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't think it is 
a radical idea to want a farm bill that supports small- and 
medium-sized farms, that supports conservation. And I don't 
think it is a radical idea to insist on a farm bill that 
doesn't increase hunger in America.
    And let me just say to the gentleman who just spoke, we can 
support our farmers and hungry families at the same time. This 
is not an either/or situation.
    And I am grateful, Mr. Secretary, to you and to Deputy 
Under Secretary Dean for all that you have done to improve food 
security in this country, especially when it comes to improving 
food security for kids over summer months and making school 
meals healthier and more accessible, which is good for our kids 
and is good for our farmers, and, by the way, will save us a 
lot of money in healthcare costs down the road. My Republican 
friends complain about the cost of some of these programs. They 
don't talk about the savings and avoidable healthcare costs 
that result by investing in these nutrition programs. So we can 
save money by doing this.
    I also want to associate myself with the remarks of the 
Ranking Member, Mr. Scott, and his comments on SNAP. The bottom 
line is the benefit, let's be honest, is inadequate. And we 
want a bipartisan farm bill, but what my Republican friends are 
proposing would cut SNAP by $30 billion and then prevent future 
increases.
    A little bit of a history lesson here, before the pandemic, 
SNAP on average was about $1.40 per person per meal. Then the 
pandemic came and, Mr. Secretary, you, thankfully, using your 
authority that Congress asked you to use, plus some emergency 
benefits, it was bumped up to about $2.40 on average per person 
per meal. Then some of these emergency benefits expired. And 
now it is down to about $2.08 per person per meal.
    Everywhere I go, I am told by organizations that deal with 
people who are food-insecure, it is not enough, it is not 
enough to be able to put healthy food, nutritious food on the 
table. And yet my friends here are advocating not only a cut, 
but preventing any future updates in terms of increases. It 
doesn't make any sense to me.
    I would say to my Republican friends that you are barely 
hanging on to your majority by your fingernails. Look at the 
results of last night's election in New York. Your majority has 
been ineffective, and what you are doing and what you are 
advocating is highly unpopular. People do not want you to 
follow MAGA extremists off a cliff. They want you to focus on 
helping struggling families instead to be able to put 
nutritious food on the table. They want us to work together on 
a farm bill that supports our farmers and supports struggling 
families. And yet what we are seeing here is what we have seen 
on almost every piece of legislation that has come before this 
House, a move to the extreme when it comes to programs that 
benefit the most vulnerable.
    Now, Mr. Secretary, some on this Committee complained that 
you increased SNAP benefits during the pandemic. I don't think 
anyone here, I don't think, truly believes that SNAP benefits 
should be based on the cost of a food plan that would now be 50 
years old. Can you explain why you reevaluated the Thrifty Food 
Plan? Did you just decide that on your own, or did Republicans 
and Democrats in Congress tell you to do that?
    Secretary Vilsack. In the 2018 Farm Bill, the direction 
from Congress was that USDA was to consider cost-conscious 
healthy diets for families on low- and moderate-income. They 
specifically directed us to use the following: current dietary 
guidance, consumption patterns, food composition data, and 
current food prices. We essentially followed that to the T. We 
used the scientific process of calculating the impact and 
effect on the Thrifty Food Plan base foundation for SNAP, and 
we concluded that it required an increase.
    Mr. McGovern. And what would the theoretical impacts be to 
holding the Thrifty Food Plan to the cost of the 2021 plan for 
another 20, 30, 40 years?
    Secretary Vilsack. You would eventually have a food plan 
that did not adequately meet the need of families who are 
struggling financially.
    Mr. McGovern. My friends complain about the cost of 
groceries at the supermarket, and yet they are advocating 
policies that will make it more difficult for people to be able 
to afford those groceries. This doesn't make sense, investing 
in these programs--and, again, I applaud you for your 
leadership on this. Investing in these nutrition programs are 
not only the right thing to do because we should care about 
people, all people, not just those with deep pockets, but it 
will also save our healthcare system a boatload of money in the 
future, also help our farmers. And I thank you for your 
leadership, and I yield back my time.
    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts.
    Before I recognize Mr. Crawford, I do want to submit for 
the record a document that uses CBO scores on exactly what is 
being proposed with providing article 1 direction in terms of 
completing the Thrifty Food Plan evaluation consistent with how 
it has been done the past except for this past time. As CBO's 
records, it shows the benefits level. Quite frankly, there is 
no intent to cut current benefits. And this talks about if that 
proposal would go forward, what the benefits would be in the 
future.
    Mr. Costa. Well, Mr. Chairman, we should do a whole hearing 
on that because we respectfully disagree with your conclusion.
    The Chairman. Well, this is CBO's conclusion. I am not 
making things up. The facts are the facts. And so I will submit 
this, be willing to share this with any Member that would like 
to have a personal copy of it as well.
    [The information referred to is located on p. 105.]
    The Chairman. I am now pleased to recognize the gentleman 
from Arkansas, the land of rice and ducks, Mr. Crawford for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here. How often do you 
interact with the President's Council of Economic Advisers?
    Secretary Vilsack. I am sorry, how often?
    Mr. Crawford. How often do you interact with that council?
    Secretary Vilsack. I actually interacted with the chair 
yesterday.
    Mr. Crawford. Really?
    Secretary Vilsack. Yes.
    Mr. Crawford. I would suggest that y'all probably aren't 
singing from the same hymnal because you just said that 
inflation was on a downward trajectory when in fact the Council 
of Economic Advisers just said that grocery stores are actually 
causing inflation to increase. And that was a statement as 
recently as February 1. In fact, here is an article I am happy 
to share with you. Biden Takes Aim at Grocery Chains Over Food 
Prices.\1\ So it says here, ``President Biden has begun to 
accuse stores of overcharging shoppers as food costs remain a 
burden for consumers and a political problem for the 
President.'' He coined the phrase--I don't know that he coined 
it, but he used the phrase ``shrinkflation'' to describe how 
packaging, basically, smaller portions in a bag charging the 
same price for is having an impact on prices at the grocery 
store as well.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ Editor's note: the article referred to is located on p. 128.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    So, these accusations and charges and things of this nature 
about the evil Republicans just don't hold water. I think 
probably you should go revisit the Council of Economic Advisors 
and maybe y'all will get on the same page because we are 
hearing mixed messages now from you and from the Council of 
Economic--there wasn't a question there, Secretary.
    Last year, when you testified before the Committee, I asked 
you about the adverse effect wage rate. And you mentioned at 
the time that your preferred solution for the AEWR was to pass 
the Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2021 (H.R. 1603, 117th 
Congress). And we all know that the bill had significant issues 
that were unrelated to the adverse effect wage rate that kept 
it from becoming law, so I don't think that was necessarily the 
answer to the problem.
    So since you were here last year, my friend Mr. Davis and 
I, who have been leading the Agriculture Labor Working Group, 
we have been hearing from everyone, and everyone has talked 
about--and when I say everyone, I am talking about stakeholder 
groups, ag employers across the country that have come in to 
share their concerns. And the prevailing sentiment was that the 
adverse effect wage rate continues to be a huge problem. It is 
an impediment to the efficient functioning of the H-2A program. 
Georgia, for example, has seen a more than 20 percent increase 
in the AEWR in the last 2 years, completely unsustainable. So 
do you agree that Congress needs to reform AEWR in such a way 
as to ensure predictable and sensible wage levels for H-2A 
employers?
    Secretary Vilsack. I think it makes sense for Congress to--
with their problems with the Farmworker Modernization Act to 
fix that and pass it because it would create stability, it 
would create a range, it would create predictability in the 
system.
    Mr. Crawford. Let me ask you this, changing subjects real 
quick here. As you know, in many USDA programs, especially in 
Rural Development, there are costly and time-consuming 
environmental processes that ultimately end in the project 
being a categorical exclusion from NEPA. The current system is 
a barrier to entry to potential borrowers, lenders, and 
grantees to participate in the system, and when they do, they 
often spend much time and money to meet paperwork requirements. 
All of it keeps funds from being deployed in rural America.
    The Department of Energy has already issued rules to make 
charging stations and solar projects categorically excluded 
within the DOT and the Department of Homeland Security then 
adopted for their departments.
    My question is what steps is USDA taking to implement the 
statutory categorical exclusions listed in the Fiscal 
Responsibility Act (Pub. L. 118-5), specifically loan 
guarantees? And if no action has been taken yet, when can we 
expect actions to be taken by USDA to implement those 
provisions?
    Secretary Vilsack. We use categorical exclusions on a 
regular basis in our programs. When there is an opportunity to 
use it, we do use it. I am particularly aware of how often we 
use it in the Forest Service in order to move processes along.
    Mr. Crawford. Okay.
    Secretary Vilsack. Eighty-five percent of the activities 
that we have done in our Forest Service the last 3 years use 
CE, so we are not opposed to using it. We actually look for 
opportunities to use it.
    Mr. Crawford. I hope that is true because I have some 
constituents that are highly concerned with that.
    Let me shift gears again. Hopefully, I can get an answer on 
this question. Your comments last month, you said, quote, 
``Here is the problem. Reference prices help a subset of 
farmers,'' end quote. These comments worry many farmers across 
my district, across the country, putting in the hard work of 
feeding and clothing the world. And to be clear, when I say 
farmers in this context, I mean those who are producing our 
food and fiber at scale.
    You focused a lot of your attention on climate, but when 
you talk about farmers, you often talk about USDA's role in 
protecting what I would call more hobby farmers. These are 
folks I certainly care about, and I don't believe they should 
be completely ignored by USDA programs, but many of them are 
not full-time farmers or truly dependent on income from the 
farm to keep them financially afloat.
    And alone, our country in the world can't be dependent on 
their output, which is less than 20 percent of all agricultural 
production. You acknowledged that earlier in your statement. So 
my time has run out, but I will yield back.
    The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired.
    I now recognize the gentlelady from Virginia, Ms. 
Spanberger, for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Spanberger. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And 
thank you, Secretary Vilsack, for being here.
    I come from Virginia where our number one private industry 
is agriculture. And I had a bit of a visceral reaction when the 
gentleman talked about hobby farmers and those who don't make 
farming their full-time income because I represent so many of 
those farmers. And the reason that farming may not be their 
full-time income is because they can't afford to do it. We have 
small generational family farms that, frankly, many of the 
conservation programs have helped the farmers I represent save 
and make more productive.
    And I will give a specific example. I was out visiting a 
farm in Caroline County, and a farmer said he has 1,000 acres 
of cereal rye, and he did a testing. This is last year. And 
they found rye roots 7 deep. And that was after 34 days 
without rain. He said that cover crop usage and their use of 
no-till practices, the cover crop land never gave up an inch. 
His soil is rich. His ability to produce on that land is made 
possible, according to the farmer, by his usage of conservation 
programs that are made possible because of these Federal 
programs.
    So I am grateful that you are here to speak to a whole 
variety of issues. And I am proud that we were able to invest 
in conservation programs at USDA through the Inflation 
Reduction Act because, in fact, we know that there are so many 
more farmers like the one I just mentioned who want to 
participate in these programs that lower input costs, increase 
their bottom line, and make farming possible in communities 
like those that I represent. But so many are turned away 
because of lack of funding.
    So I am pleased to see that, according to a new USDA report 
on funding IRA implementation, Virginia has already received 
nearly $8 million in funding that goes directly to farmers 
across our Commonwealth who want them to increase their 
productivity, improve wildlife habitats, improve air and water 
quality, and help farmers stay farmers.
    So could you please elaborate on USDA's progress in getting 
IRA conservation dollars to farmers and producers? And 
specifically, has the law helped these programs reach more 
producers?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, clearly, the answer to your 
question is yes. It has obviously increased the reach of the 
programs. There is still a great deal to do. We have increased 
the number of people working at NRCS. We have entered into 
cooperative agreements so that we have a broader reach so that 
those who might not be able to understand they qualify for the 
program are finding out about the program, or assisting in 
guiding them into participating.
    And let me just simply say that roughly 85 to 88 percent of 
farmers in this country today require off-farm income to be 
able to keep the farm. So with all due respect, it is not about 
hobby farmers. It is about folks who love what they are doing 
and, frankly, would like to be able to do more of it, but they 
don't have the income streams that support it so they have to 
have an off-farm job. And to me, the key here is creating 
opportunities for that farm to generate more revenue.
    You mentioned cover crops. That is an opportunity, 
potentially, for that farm to qualify for ecosystem service 
market payments.
    Ms. Spanberger. Yes.
    Secretary Vilsack. But now instead of just a crop, they are 
going to get an environmental payment. There are a multitude of 
other strategies here that we are investing in, and 
conservation and investments in conservation are critically 
important to allowing those income streams to occur.
    Ms. Spanberger. And that is what I hear time and time again 
from the producers I represent.
    So in that vein, how can Congress continue supporting USDA, 
whether through statutory flexibility, you mentioned additional 
staffing. What else needs to happen to expedite these funds 
getting out the door?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, first, a budget that doesn't 
require us to cut staff. Second, maintaining the IRA funding, 
and----
    Ms. Spanberger. And, sir, you said it before, but could you 
just remind everyone how much staff do you have to cut because 
of the budget challenges?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, the House Agriculture 
appropriations talked about an 18 percent cut to our budget, so 
you can do the math.
    Ms. Spanberger. Yes, thank you. Please continue.
    Secretary Vilsack. Maintain the IRA funding. Let's get a 
budget, pass a farm bill so there is certainty in terms of the 
programs. And, to a certain extent, continue to support our 
efforts on the climate-smart because that is also tied to the 
conservation activities and programs. We saw tremendous demand 
for that and tremendous interest in it.
    Ms. Spanberger. And just in closing, related to some of the 
challenges at the grocery store, I received a message from a 
darling constituent who, speaking of our extraordinary country, 
said, I for one still find it amazing that you can buy a 
pineapple in January for $1.29 on sale at the grocery store, 
truly an incredible country.
    Thank you for serving this incredible country.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    The Chairman. The gentlelady yields back.
    I now recognize Mr. DesJarlais from Tennessee for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. DesJarlais. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Secretary 
Vilsack, thank you for always coming and visiting with us.
    With the record influx of illegal crossings at the southern 
border, I was wondering what steps you are taking to mitigate 
potential strain on the SNAP program.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, people coming across the border 
don't qualify for SNAP and aren't participating in SNAP.
    Mr. DesJarlais. From the USDA Food Nutrition Service SNAP 
policy on non-citizen eligibility, it says non-citizens 
eligible with no waiting period, and there is about 13, but I 
will just read a few: qualified alien children under 18 years 
of age, so anyone under 18 qualifies without a waiting period; 
refugees admitted under section 207; victims of trafficking and 
trafficking victims under the Act of 2000, and unfortunately, 
there is a lot of them; asylees under section 208. And, I mean, 
you would have to agree that almost everyone coming into the 
country is either seeking refugee status, asylum status, or 
under 18, so how can you say that this is not going to put a 
strain on the SNAP program?
    Secretary Vilsack. Because the fact that they are seeking 
asylum doesn't mean that they qualify. They have to be granted 
asylum.
    Mr. DesJarlais. We have 42 million people on SNAP now. We 
have had roughly ten million crossing over, most of them 
seeking asylum. That will come due, so as we plan a 5 year farm 
bill, we need transparency in order to make sure people are 
taken care of.
    Secretary Vilsack. [inaudible] go down, sir.
    Mr. DesJarlais. There has been a shortfall to go this year 
in funding for the SNAP program. There has been fraud that if 
you go to social media--you got to love social media. I did it 
this morning. I said, what is the fraud rate in the SNAP 
program? The very first thing that pops up says 1.5 percent. 
Then I go to the past year, and I would like to introduce this 
into the record. I would ask unanimous consent. This article 
from The Hill in September of 2023, Fraud is gobbling up one-
fifth of SNAP benefits; Congress must act to stop it.\2\ That 
1.5 percent is 11.5 percent, ten times more than what we are 
led to believe if you read social media.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ Editor's note: the article referred to is located on p. 132.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    So I am not trying to be confrontational, Mr. Secretary. 
And we have had lively discussions in this Committee that 
Republicans apparently don't care about people who care about 
food hunger. We do. I am just saying that to plan this 
effectively, we need to address these issues that are real. You 
can say that people don't receive SNAP benefits, but your own 
USDA says that they do. And you can say the fraud is low, but 
those numbers are not correct, and that was exposed this year.
    Secretary Vilsack. No, let's be clear about this. I am 
saying that people who are not here legally are not allowed to, 
or are, participating in SNAP. I will acknowledge that we have 
work to do on fraud, but I will tell you, it is our partners 
who have work to do. It is the states who administer these 
programs. It is the states that we are encouraging them to get 
back to interviewing folks. States are resisting that. I just 
recently sent a letter to a number of Governors encouraging 
them to do a better job of overseeing this program. So I agree 
with you that we need to make sure that we are keeping an eye 
on fraudulent activities.
    Mr. DesJarlais. I am just afraid hungry Americans are not 
going to receive the benefits they need if we don't address 
this issue. It is real. I have been imploring different 
agencies, including USDA, to get real numbers and transparency. 
I hope that some of my letters and questions will be answered.
    I kind of want to finish on a more fun note. We have talked 
about the walking horse industry in Tennessee before, you and 
I, and it is my understanding that there is a proposed rule 
that is currently being reviewed by OMB. And, we had hoped that 
the PAST Act supporters and the industry could come to 
agreement on how to best move forward. But now that is not 
really the impact. I am curious. Have you ever been to the 
Walking Horse Celebration in Shelbyville?
    Secretary Vilsack. I have not been to the----
    Mr. DesJarlais. Okay. This summer, Chairman Thompson, and 
he just left--Rep. Jonathan Jackson joined John Rose and I at 
the stable, and I think it is fair to say--not to put words in 
the Chairman's mouth--he was a skeptic, probably a PAST Act-
supporter, maybe Jonathan, too. But they had a really great 
experience, and they inspected for themselves. They both rode 
walking horses, and the walking horses could handle both of 
these guys, and they are pretty big fellas. So I would love to 
invite you down, let you go for a ride. It is really smooth. I 
think you will smile as big as the Chairman did. And I know 
that the celebration will be coming this summer, so I would 
like to give you a standing invitation to join us, come look at 
it for yourself.
    Thoroughbreds were dropping dead on the tracks at all three 
major races, at the Preakness, the Belmont, and the Kentucky 
Derby. I have never seen a walking horse drop dead. And the 
PAST Act is just that. It is living in the past. There was 
problems years ago. They have been corrected, and I would love 
for you to come and see it and see what a wonderful industry 
this is.
    I yield back.
    The Chairman. The gentleman yields back. And I would have 
to say it is a pretty smooth ride actually, a large animal that 
was a little intimidating to crawl on, but it was a good ride.
    I am now pleased to recognize Ms. Caraveo from Colorado for 
5 minutes of questioning.
    Ms. Caraveo. Thank you, Chairman Thompson and Ranking 
Member Scott, for hosting today's hearing.
    In particular, given that it has been, I think, 6 months 
since we were in this room, 6 months of delay because of the 
dysfunction and Congress' inability to do its very basic jobs, 
and that interfering with incredibly important discussions that 
producers and consumers and I think all of our districts have 
been waiting for us to have in particular around the farm bill. 
And so thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here this morning.
    As you know, Congress did make incredible investments in 
the Inflation Reduction Act before the 118th to expand clean 
energy in rural America. We appreciate your work and your 
listening to rural Americans when designing the USDA programs. 
I know in Colorado I have heard overwhelming interest in the 
IRA rural energy programs, which include REAP, PACE, and the 
Empowering Rural America Program, or New ERA. These grant 
programs represent jobs and economic growth in my district. And 
I was very pleased to see recently projects in Platteville and 
Longmont selected for the New ERA program.
    Because of the popularity of these programs, the reality is 
that they are dramatically oversubscribed, as we have heard 
today. New ERA, for example, is four times oversubscribed, 
which I believe shows how important this program is to electric 
cooperatives across the country, regardless of politics, and 
how important it is for our cooperatives to see this kind of 
long overdue investment. It is great to see this and to 
highlight the excitement of rural co-ops across the country.
    So, Mr. Secretary, for New ERA, can you share an update on 
how we might see applications start to move forward in the 
process?
    Secretary Vilsack. We are in the process of completing the 
evaluation of approximately 70 projects of the number that was 
submitted, as you indicated, it was a very popular program and 
oversubscribed, in an effort to try to determine which of these 
programs are feasible from a technical standpoint and from a 
financial standpoint. Once those evaluations are done, those 
projects will be ranked. And then we will basically compare 
those rankings to the resources that are available and begin a 
more detailed conversation to assert whether or not in fact the 
project is worthy of commitment.
    I think our goal is to try to get awards sometime later 
this year. In the meantime, we are aggressively promoting the 
REAP program, over 5,000 REAP grants already awarded. We are 
going to see awards on a quarterly basis, and you will see PACE 
awards here sometime this spring.
    Ms. Caraveo. I really appreciate that update. It is clear 
that USDA agencies, staff, and officials have expended a huge 
amount of effort and time to get these programs up and running, 
and program applicants have spent a lot of time and capital to 
write and submit applications. Considering that, could you 
estimate the implications and costs for USDA and the applicants 
of reopening and amending these programs at this stage where 
USDA has already received and begun to review applications?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I don't think--we are not in a 
circumstance, I think, where you reopen unless there is 
additional resources that become available. Then, we would be 
happy to take a look at what additional projects could 
potentially be funded. But we have a limited resource, and we 
are working within the constraints of those resources.
    Ms. Caraveo. Thank you. I appreciate that.
    Switching gears, I would like to join my colleagues in 
reiterating the importance of strong nutrition programs at the 
USDA. Last week, I had county commissioners here from my 
district who shared the steady increase they have seen since 
the pandemic that is unprecedented with no sign of slowing 
down. In fact, SNAP applications in one of the largest counties 
in my district are up 26 percent. They are not down. And so I 
think it is very important to remember the implications of 
SNAP. And when we talk about, first of all, who gets SNAP, 96 
percent of SNAP participants are U.S. citizens, only four 
percent are not citizens, and three percent of those are lawful 
permanent residents. And, most importantly for me as a 
pediatrician, 42 percent of SNAP recipients are children. 
Children, like the ones that I saw in clinic every day where 
\2/3\ of the kids that I saw did not have enough to eat, and 
were it not for SNAP, would not have anything to eat.
    So can you quickly expand more on the impact of SNAP on 
families and the children that we always purport to care about 
in this Congress?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, there is research that indicates 
that the SNAP program is one of the most if not the most 
effective anti-poverty program that we have. There is also 
research to show that when you essentially provide adequate 
SNAP benefits, families purchase more nutritious food and have 
better health outcomes for their children.
    Ms. Caraveo. I thank you for the support that you give to 
those children with your work every single day. And thank you 
once again for answering those questions. I yield back.
    The Chairman. Ms. Caraveo, thank you very much.
    I now recognize gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Rouzer, 
for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Rouzer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Just a note about large farms versus small farms, it is 
only the larger farms that can survive the onslaught of the 
government--Federal, state, and local--so the smaller ones go 
out of business and the bigger ones get bigger because it is 
the only way they can survive. Anyhow, commentary there.
    Mr. Secretary, chicken plants across the country have been 
operating at higher speeds for more than 25 years through the 
FSIS line speed waivers, as you know well. Under President 
Clinton, a study allowed 20 poultry plants to operate 
evisceration lines up to 175 birds a minute. Plants invested, 
therefore, millions in technology, grew their partner farms to 
supply the poultry needed, and maintained worker safety and 
inspection standards all the same.
    Now, these positive pilot results led to the new poultry 
inspection system. Today, 47 plants operate under this system. 
Farms all across North Carolina have built operations to 
support increased capacity, and plants have designed staffing 
and facility needs around these speeds. Now, OSHA data from 
1994 to 2019, when substantial line speed increases were put in 
place, shows illness and injury down 91 percent, evidence that 
faster line speeds don't compromise worker safety.
    Now, a 2020 proposed rule incentivizes more plants to adopt 
these improved processes and new technologies while increasing 
speeds but was repealed by this Administration. Instead, your 
agency informed companies with line speed waivers that to keep 
them they were required to, quote, ``opt in'' to a study on 
worker safety being conducted outside of the agency.
    Now, I want to point out to the Committee that this was a 
sole-source contract and not a competitive bid, and no member 
of the study team is from a land-grant institution with 
knowledge of the chicken industry, but instead are associates 
of the University of California system. Now, a member of that 
study team testified in front of OSHA against a company 
participating in the study and has vocally critiqued a number 
of other plants. Considering the work of other team members and 
the information requested before each plant visit that far 
exceeds the scope of the study, there is a clear bias against 
the industry and leads any objective observer to the conclusion 
this is a ``gotcha'' operation.
    Mr. Secretary, real quickly, can you submit, and are you 
willing to submit in writing, how much is being spent for the 
study, the source of that funding, and how the team members 
were selected? And why are they all associated with the 
University of California?
    Secretary Vilsack. Be happy to respond to questions, but I 
think it is fair to say that there is litigation that is 
essentially driving a lot of this effort. Issues were raised 
concerning worker safety as a result of this line speed, and 
this is a process of trying to make sure that we get the right 
data, the significant data to be able to support whether the 
line speeds are, in fact, a result of additional worker injury 
or not. If they are not, then obviously, line speeds are going 
to continue. If they are, then there is going to have to be 
some adjustment. But we just don't have all of the data we 
need, and that is the reason why we have entered into an 
agreement with the producers. This is not a situation where 
they were--they had the choice. They had the choice. And these 
plants chose to participate in this study.
    Mr. Rouzer. Yes, they chose to participate in the study and 
in good faith, and it has turned into something that they 
didn't anticipate. Aren't you concerned----
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, that is----
    Mr. Rouzer.--about a bias study here given the 
circumstances?
    Secretary Vilsack. I don't think you should prejudge the 
study. The study hasn't been concluded yet.
    Mr. Rouzer. Well, the old adage----
    Secretary Vilsack. Why don't you wait to see what the study 
is?
    Mr. Rouzer. Pardon me, but the old adage personnel is 
policy certainly applies here.
    Now, I got to move on quickly to another matter. USDA is 
currently developing the next set of Dietary Guidelines, and 
this is specific to alcohol. Federal law requires that 
scientific and medical knowledge support any changes to the 
Dietary Guidelines on the consumption of alcohol. How is the 
technical committee process ensuring that this mandate is 
followed? Have you been following that?
    Secretary Vilsack. I haven't, and it is my understanding 
that this is outside of the Dietary Guideline conversation.
    Mr. Rouzer. Well, alcohol has always been included in 
Dietary Guidelines, but this takes it outside of the scope of 
Dietary Guidelines. That is the issue.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I think that in an effort to try 
to make sure that there is a deeper review and dive on this 
issue, I suspect, for future Dietary Guidelines.
    Mr. Rouzer. Well, I just mention this. There are a lot of 
growers around the country that produce a product that is used 
for adult beverages that have a great interest in this, and I 
would like to follow up with some written questions as well.
    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. The gentleman yields. I am now pleased to 
recognize the Congresswoman from Illinois, Ms. Budzinski, for 5 
minutes.
    Ms. Budzinski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, 
Secretary, for joining us here today and engaging with us on a 
host of really important issues. I want to just take a moment 
to say, again, thank you so much for joining me last summer at 
the Farm Progress Show in Decatur, really appreciated you 
joining me there for that.
    Last fall, as a response to what I had heard from farmers 
in my district in central and southern Illinois, I led a letter 
with Congresswoman Pingree and Congressman Costa, along with 
all the Democrats on the Committee, outlining our shared 
priority to protect the Inflation Reduction Act climate-smart 
conservation funds. These funds, as you know, have provided a 
historic investment into our farms and have already served many 
rural farmers in my home State of Illinois.
    I was also very excited to see that 100 percent of the 
obligated IRA dollars made it into the hands of farmers in 
Illinois. And to my colleagues, I would encourage you to 
explore the new Inflation Reduction Act data visualization tool 
that the USDA put out yesterday to see the difference that the 
IRA has made in your home states.
    I also want to take a moment to celebrate the release of 
the 2022 Ag Census yesterday. Champaign County in the 13th 
Congressional District, my district, was a top ten producer of 
both corn and soybeans in the United States.
    So number one, my question, a central theme of my first 
term has been creating opportunity. I had bills to improve land 
access, to increase research funding at USDA, and to expand 
markets for farmers, all of which I hope will be a part of the 
farm bill base text. Secretary Vilsack, can you speak to how 
the Inflation Reduction Act funding for climate-smart 
conservation has created opportunities for farmers?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I think the bottom line is I think 
farmers understand what they need to do to improve soil health 
and water quality, and I think they are deeply interested in 
doing more of this, but they need help and assistance. And I 
think that is why they responded as they did to the additional 
resources of the Inflation Reduction Act, over-subscribing all 
of the programs. We saw a tremendous initiative with our 
Regional Conservation Partnership Program, which is really 
large-scale landscape activity, where we saw over $1 billion of 
requests for a limited sum, about $400 million. So the farmers 
are responding by saying, ``Give us more, help us do more of 
this, we are anxious.'' And we saw the same reaction to the 
Climate-Smart Agriculture Partnership Initiative, where we can 
create commodities that are utilizing conservation programs, 
and the result of that then provides a market opportunity for 
them, a value-added market opportunity.
    Ms. Budzinski. Thank you. And I just had another question 
on EQIP. In 2022, almost three out of every four EQIP 
applications, as you know, across the country were denied, and 
only about half of all those approved applications got funded. 
And so I consistently hear from farmers in my district that 
they want better access to these conservation programs. Is 
farmer demand meeting or even exceeding expected outlays of IRA 
money to bridge this gap?
    Secretary Vilsack. It is exceeding the resources that are 
available. I think there are two issues here. One is making 
sure that you have adequate staff and adequate technical 
assistance to help the farmers decide what they need to do. And 
then two is making sure the resources are there. And recently, 
a third issue has cropped up, which is trying to figure out 
ways in which we can speed up the process. And NRCS has 
streamlined the process. They have looked at ways in which they 
can have pre-approval so that resources can get into the field 
more quickly than in the past. So I think it is a combination 
of all three of those things to try to meet the need. But if 
you take resources away from the IRA, obviously, that is going 
to impact and affect our ability to do more work.
    Ms. Budzinski. Thank you. Thank you, and I yield back, Mr. 
Chairman.
    The Chairman. The gentlelady yields back. I now recognize 
the gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Kelly, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Secretary, I first want to say I concur with almost 
everything Mr. Rouzer said about the poultry. In 2022, at your 
direction, USDA informed poultry companies with line speed 
waivers that to continue to reap the benefits of operating at 
higher speeds, bringing more chicken to the market during 
historic inflation and record-high food prices, they had to opt 
in to this Pulse study, a study being conducted by researchers 
whose bodies of work evidence significant bias against the 
chicken industry. Yet when reading from USDA's Food and Safety 
Inspection Service constituent update of July 29, 2022, it 
says, ``Establishments with a current line speed waiver must 
agree to participate in the study and provide worker safety 
data in order to receive a modified waiver.'' That update 
directly contradicts the narrative that plants were allowed to 
opt into this study on a voluntary basis.
    USDA demands that they participate in order to keep their 
higher line speeds. A decision would be hard for plants to make 
since they placed orders months in advance and would risk 
taking a significant amount of supply offline if they went back 
down to slower speeds. The companies that have continued with 
their waivers have since been subject to researchers in their 
plants, who are going far beyond their intended purpose of 
determining what threat if any increased line speeds posed to 
worker safety.
    Mr. Secretary, can you explain why your Department lauded 
this waiver participation as voluntary when it clearly is not 
voluntary?
    Secretary Vilsack. There is litigation, Congressman, and 
essentially, in an effort to try to avoid a complete shutdown 
by a court order of line speed increases, we basically created 
the opportunity for folks to continue to convince the court 
that this was a good-faith effort to make a determination 
whether or not there were unsafe practices involved. So if we 
had done what you are suggesting, essentially, what would have 
happened is judges would have shut us down. And this happened 
in our pork line speed issue. Judges will enjoin the use of 
line speed, and everybody would have had to slow their lines 
down. So you tell me. Would you have preferred everybody 
slowing their lines down, or would you have preferred creating 
an option for people to continue at the line speeds that they 
had invested in?
    Mr. Kelly. I would prefer to have a researcher that is not 
in there to do something opposite of what they are intended to 
do.
    Secretary Vilsack. Don't assume the outcome of this study 
until it occurs.
    Mr. Kelly. I would just tell you, I spent a lot of years in 
the Army, and when an inspector comes in, they generally find 
what they are looking for if they are looking for certain 
things, whether it is there or not. And I can just say from 
experience that an IG inspection could be either good or bad 
depending on the intent of the inspector.
    Next question, though, Mr. Secretary, I have heard from 
many producers about constant challenges with the H-2A program 
regarding regulations and rules issued by the Department of 
Labor, one of which was issued almost a year ago requiring 
employers to pay varying wage rates to H-2A workers based on 
their daily job function. This rule has put the potential to 
double wage rates for employers, not to mention at a huge 
regulatory burden to try to track the work of every employee 
throughout the day through each task that they do. Did the 
Department of Labor consult with USDA on this rule?
    Secretary Vilsack. We have an ongoing conversation about 
rules relating to farm labor, and I think the reason this rule 
is structured the way it is, is because there was a general 
wage rate being applied to a variety of jobs, some of which 
required significant qualification and were much more complex. 
And so I think the effort by the Labor Department was to try to 
respond to the value of that service.
    Mr. Kelly. Yes, but they kind of went overboard here. So 
small farms are at a high disadvantage here. I guess we are 
trying to put them out of business. You are out there, and you 
are picking up potatoes, digging sweet potatoes or loading them 
on the truck, and they need you to drive a pickup truck to the 
store to pick up a part. And all of a sudden, you get 
classified at the rate of a truck driver at $40 an hour instead 
of $20 hour. And driving a pickup truck is not driving a big 
truck, but they still classify you as a truck driver, and so 
you have to be paid that wage for the remainder of the day and 
the remainder of time that you work there. You do see where 
this could be very confusing and very hard on small operations.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, that is one of the reasons why it 
would have been helpful if you all would pass the Farm 
Workforce Modernization Act. Then you wouldn't have had to deal 
with this.
    Mr. Kelly. But we didn't make this rule. But we didn't make 
this rule.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, you did in a sense. In a sense, 
you made it by not creating the opportunity for a structured, 
stable, secure, predictable system.
    Mr. Kelly. I would just say, as the Secretary of 
Agriculture, it seems to me that anyone with even a layman's 
understanding of farming would have flagged how problematic and 
how burdensome this rule is to our small operators. And they 
literally cannot compete because of over-burdensome 
regulations. When you have to track every task that a worker 
does every day, we will have more people tracking their tasks 
than we do actually doing the work.
    And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    The Chairman. The gentleman yields back. I am now pleased 
to recognize the gentlelady from Maine, Congresswoman Pingree, 
for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Pingree. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you 
so much, Mr. Secretary, for being here today. I really 
appreciate all the things you have been talking to us about and 
your very thoughtful answers. And I, as a Member of the 
Appropriations Committee, just want to thank you for reminding 
everyone in the room that passing an appropriations bill is 
critically important. If we are all going to talk about the 
importance of getting a farm bill done, we have to remember 
that we need the funding for your agency as well and that the 
18 percent cut that was proposed is ludicrous. So I am counting 
on my good friend, Mr. Bishop, for fixing all that before we 
take it to the floor, but let's just hope we can eventually get 
that to the floor.
    We have been talking a lot about climate change and 
disaster resilience and really what I see now as this extreme 
weather that all of us are facing and our farmers are facing. 
And you were very kind to come and visit us in Maine last month 
right after we had had some horrendous storm in December that 
caught our forestry and farming folks off guard and really 
impacted our state with the flooding and the high winds. One of 
the farmers we showed you some pictures of was Chuck Noyes, a 
dairy farmer in Albion, Maine. He lost two buildings and a 
roof, and his insurance does not cover rebuilding the barn, and 
he is not sure if he is going to get the roof replacement.
    But a few days after you visited, we had two more storms 
back-to-back that really impacted our coastline, so that was 
our working waterfronts and our fishing community, more 
significant damage.
    And I like to remind people, this wasn't the only bad 
weather we have had. We had frost that destroyed our fruit 
crops in the spring. We had wet weather in the summer that left 
hay that couldn't be harvested or in such poor condition that 
our dairy farmers and livestock farmers have to supplement the 
diet this winter with increased grain and corn silage. This is 
going to continue to impact our farmers.
    And I just want to talk a little bit about the tools you 
are trying to provide to help farmers to be more resilient. We 
all want to make sure there is disaster relief aid, and we 
appreciate your request for more of that because it is getting 
more and more expensive. But so much of what you are doing is 
to try to prevent the disasters that we are facing in terms of 
how farmers deal with drought and flooding. And so can you talk 
a little bit about what the work you are doing is to help 
farmers have more resilient fields and to deal with some of 
this adverse weather?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I would say there are three or 
four steps that we are taking. First of all, we continue to 
focus some of our research efforts on figuring out exactly what 
works and what doesn't work in the field to basically create a 
more resilient farming operation and certainly would encourage 
continued investment in our research initiatives.
    Second, the Climate-Smart Agriculture Commodity Initiative, 
141 projects across the United States, all major commodities, 
looking at 205 different practices to determine the viability 
of those practices in terms of resiliency and sustainability. I 
think we are going to learn a lot from that experience. We have 
nearly 100 universities, minority-serving institutions involved 
and engaged in that effort, and we are now beginning to see a 
lot of interest in that.
    We have mentioned today a number of times the IRA and the 
investments in conservation, whether it is the EQIP or CSP or 
from a large-scale landscape basis, the Regional Conservation 
Partnership Program. That also is, I think, significant. We are 
also using our risk management tools to encourage more cover 
crop activity by providing incentives for the use of cover 
crop, and this most recent Ag Census indicates that that is 
beginning to work as we see an expansion of cover crop 
activity. So it is across-the-board efforts to try to make sure 
that we are a good partner with farmers, ranchers, and 
producers.
    Ms. Pingree. Yes, thank you for that. And I do want to say, 
I know it comes up often, people criticize your use of the CCC, 
Commodity Credit Corporation, and having that flexibility. 
Sometimes it is talked about like it is a sacred cow, but I 
really appreciate how you are putting it to beneficial use, as 
you said, doing the kinds of research and the projects at all 
different scales around the country so people really have the 
examples of what to do, so thank you for that.
    One more specific question on the Organic Market 
Development funding, I know you have talked a lot about how you 
get farmers extra income, and growing organic produce or 
organic food for the market is often that. I am really pleased 
to see that the USDA is providing ten Organic Market 
Development grants to address gaps in the organic market like 
processing, transporting, and consumer markets. Can you tell us 
a little bit about the demand for the program, where the 
funding for the program is coming from, and how we can support 
more of that organic market work?
    Secretary Vilsack. There are, I think, two initiatives. The 
American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Pub. L. 117-2) provided 
resources for us to establish an Organic Marketing Assistance 
Program. The application period for that program is still 
available I think through October of this year. There has been 
quite a bit of interest in that to assist farmers in terms of 
offsetting the cost of marketing.
    And then, as you indicated, we really wanted to take a look 
at trying to right size if you will the supply and demand of 
organic opportunities across the country. And so we have 
awarded a number of entities resources to be able to tell us, 
how do we create demand? How do we make sure that the demand is 
being created where the supply is? Or conversely, how do we 
create the supply where we already have demand so that we 
basically right size?
    We have also created a transition program, making it easier 
for people who want to become organic producers to be able to 
do so with mentoring, with assistance on conservation costs 
associated with the transition, and with some risk management 
opportunities as well. So it is a combination.
    Ms. Pingree. Thank you. I have gone over my time. Those are 
great answers. And I appreciate the Chairman indulging that 
extra minute. Thank you so much, Mr. Secretary.
    The Chairman. I thank the gentlelady. I now recognize the 
gentleman from Nebraska, Mr. Bacon, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Bacon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome here to Mr. 
Secretary. I appreciate you being here today.
    I have two questions. One is cybersecurity, and then a 
follow-up on trade. A first on cybersecurity. There was a 
recent article published in the Joint Force Quarterly kind of 
weaponizing wheat. It was written by an Air Force Lieutenant 
Colonel Scheuerman, and he assesses the security status of 
America's food supply, and his findings are disturbing.
    So, Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit that for the 
record, this article.
    The Chairman. Without objection.
    [The article referred to is located on p. 134.]
    Mr. Bacon. In the article, Lieutenant Colonel Karl 
Scheuerman identifies agricultural cybersecurity as one of the 
most pressing threats to our agriculture. Russia is a top cyber 
adversary known for targeting cloud infrastructure, for 
example. We have had cyber attacks on industry leaders like 
JBS, who are seeing state-sponsored attacks that have caused 
real-world effects targeting critical infrastructure like grain 
storage facilities.
    So, Mr. Secretary, I have been working on a bill for a 
couple of years called the American Agriculture Security Act of 
2024. It establishes research centers at our American land-
grant institutions across the nation with a purpose of 
researching physical and biological cyber threats to American 
agriculture. These centers would be structured and operated 
like the UARCs that we see used by the DOD, and they have shown 
a lot of promise with our military.
    So, Mr. Secretary, what is your take? Would this move us in 
the right direction for helping provide better cybersecurity? 
Or what else can we be doing to protect our farmers?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, Representative, it will if it is 
adequately funded. It is not enough to set up a center unless 
you have the resources behind it. But I think you are right to 
put a spotlight on this. And certainly land-grant universities 
are already doing some of this, perhaps not as in coordinated 
fashion as they need to.
    At USDA, we are really focused on making sure that the 
private-sector is hardening their assets, hardening their IT 
against these kinds of attacks? Obviously, you mentioned JBS. 
When something like that happens, our role and responsibility 
is to evaluate the impact on the market of a disruption, a 
significant disruption, which we did in that case, and to 
convene the industry to remind them of the importance of 
investing in protection. There is an interagency effort in this 
Administration to sort of focus on cybersecurity and on AI in 
particular and taking a look at the entirety of our portfolio 
from food safety to SNAP bias to market manipulation to trade 
policy. It is all-encompassing.
    Mr. Bacon. Now, our DOD runs something similar with the 
UARCs, and it has been very successful. You are right; they 
have to be funded.
    My second question is on trade. If I had to provide the 
number one feedback or maybe criticism of the Administration 
that I hear from Nebraska producers--and I believe would be in 
your home state as well in Iowa--is we don't hear much from the 
Administration on trade. In fact, I very seldom hear the 
President discussing trade at all. And just like Iowa, Nebraska 
is very dependent on beef, pork, corn, wheat, sorghum exports. 
So could you tell us, what is the Administration doing, and, 
hopefully clearing up the misperception if anything?
    Secretary Vilsack. Sure. Well, first of all, it was 
mentioned by Representative Scott the establishment of the 
Regional Ag Promotion Program, nearly $1 billion being invested 
at the request of Senator Stabenow and Senator Boozman, a 
bipartisan request to invest in trade. Focusing on 
diversification of our market opportunity, we are over-reliant 
on our top four markets from an ag perspective, and so we want 
to put resources to increase our presence, our promotions, and 
our partnerships in a number of countries, particularly in 
Southeast Asia, number one.
    Number two, I think the focus people have on when they 
define trade, they talk about it in terms of trade agreements. 
I mean, the reality is you don't have trade promotion 
authority, so it is very difficult to imagine a trade agreement 
being negotiated when the people we are negotiating with 
realize that there are 535 folks who can negotiate again. So 
without trade promotion authority, that is an issue.
    So in the meantime, we are working on trying to reduce 
barriers. And I can tell you that roughly $21 billion of trade 
opportunities have been created or maintained as a result of 
wins looking at reducing trade barriers. The UK and wood 
pellets and biomass; Canada and the clean fuel regulation; 
Mexico and potato access; Japan, beef quota, higher-blend 
ethanol availability; India, preservation of apples, expanded 
cherry access; the Philippines, expanded access to pork; China, 
almonds and almond hulls recently; Argentina, apples and pears; 
Israel, processed meat and eggs. There are a whole series of 
things that have occurred over the last 3 years. The cumulative 
impact and effect of them is either to protect or to expand 
trade opportunities.
    So that is what we are up to. We are expanding trade 
missions and considering reverse trade missions where we bring 
people from other countries here in the U.S. So it is a 
combination of many things that don't necessarily get 
headlines, but are particularly effective in terms of trade.
    Mr. Bacon. Thank you. As you know, the Iowa farmers and 
Nebraska farmers, we like to feed the world. Thank you. I yield 
back.
    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman from Nebraska. I am now 
pleased to recognize the gentlelady from Washington State, 
Congresswoman Gluesenkamp Perez.
    Ms. Perez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Mr. 
Secretary, for being here.
    We actually just had Under Secretary Torres Small visit our 
district. And to Representative Bacon's point, we actually had 
a really productive conversation around trade and foreign 
access to our apple growers.
    So our state, Washington State, particularly on the west 
side, is dominated by much smaller producers. Right now, we 
only have 5,700 farms. Their average size is about 158 acres, 
so much smaller. We are losing a lot of our small- and medium-
sized producers, as you might be familiar with. And, at the 
same time, I am seeing really troubling reports that, on 
average, the American consumer, about 40 percent of the fresh 
fruits and vegetables they consume are from overseas or from 
our trade partners here. So this together paints a really 
troubling picture that our smaller producers are really in 
trouble and getting squeezed out of the market.
    And I want to make sure that we have a farm system that 
allows the small- and medium-sized farms to thrive. They 
shouldn't have to depend on agritourism or value-added 
propositions like a solar farm to survive in my view. These are 
really important ventures on their own merits, but they 
shouldn't be necessary for farmers that want to continue and 
pass on their farm to the next generation.
    So I am asking just what are your thoughts on this? What is 
the USDA currently doing to support the stability and viability 
of these small- and medium-sized producers, and how can 
Congress be a better partner in this work?
    Secretary Vilsack. Congresswoman, I would be happy to come 
to your office and give you a rather extensive discussion about 
what we are doing. Climate-Smart Agriculture Commodity 
Initiative, helping smaller-sized producers get a value-added 
proposition; having farmers qualify for ecosystem service 
markets, and when they do the right conservation and there is a 
conservation benefit and a greenhouse gas reduction or carbon 
being sequestered, they are getting paid for it; the use of the 
Renewable Energy for America Program to reduce the cost of 
electricity and maybe even producing excess electricity, which 
could be combined with their neighbors to provide a transition 
for the rural electric cooperative, creating a new energy 
commodity; expanded access to processing, local processing, 
over 400 projects invested by USDA in the last 3 years; 
focusing on local and regional food purchasing agreements. We 
have provided your secretary, your commissioner, your director 
of agriculture in Washington with millions of dollars, 
encouraging them to have direct connection and contracts with 
local producers, small producers to be able to provide those 
fruits and vegetables for schools and for the food banks, using 
our procurement dollars as well for that purpose. Reducing 
fertilizer costs with investing in new fertilizer capacity in 
the U.S.
    So there is a broad array of strategies, and the goal here 
is to create new income streams so it is not just the commodity 
that they are selling that they have to survive on because the 
reality is they also have an off-farm job. That is how they are 
surviving. The question is, do we have to have the farmer have 
the off-farm job, or can we figure out the way the farm can 
have three or four different sources of income simultaneously? 
I would be more than happy to show you the investments that we 
have made, the extent particularly as a state, in Washington 
specifically.
    Ms. Perez. Yes, we are very excited about some new growth 
in processing in particular, so thank you for the support 
there.
    I wanted to change gears just a little bit and talk about 
another really important issue for my district, NAAQS, so 
effectively addressing the wildfire crisis, it requires forest 
management activities, including removing trees and other low-
value material. Timber sales, working in conjunction with other 
tools like prescribed burns, habitat restoration and 
reforestation where appropriate will ensure that we can have 
safe and resilient forests while growing rural economies.
    Last week, the EPA updated PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS rule, 
which will significantly tighten air quality standards. I am 
concerned about the impact this new rule will have on our 
forest product industry and our ability to conduct prescribed 
burns. When I burn the bacon, it is probably reaching air 
quality standards that might trigger in my house. And so we 
lost 731 acres in the Gifford Pinchot, and I want to make sure 
that we are utilizing every tool at our disposal.
    Could you speak to how USDA and EPA are working together to 
promote the use of prescribed fire? And generally, how can we 
be better partners when tackling the wildfire crisis?
    Secretary Vilsack. We entered into an MOU with the EPA to 
avoid a restriction on the use of prescribed fire as it relates 
to that particular regulation. So that was a result of 
negotiations and recently concluded in a signed MOU. Also, we 
have our Wildfire Crisis Strategy where we are investing 
resources from the infrastructure law in the IRA into more 
hazardous fuel reduction. And finally, we are creating market 
opportunities for that wood by developing cross-laminated 
timber projects and by focusing on wood innovation.
    Ms. Perez. Thank you, Secretary. I yield back.
    The Chairman. I thank the gentlelady. I now recognize the 
gentleman from South Dakota, Mr. Johnson, for 5 minutes of 
questioning.
    Mr. Johnson. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Thanks, Mr. Secretary, 
for being here. You and I have had productive conversations in 
the past about the fact that managed forests are healthy 
forests, and unmanaged forests are tinderboxes. Unfortunately, 
I think for a lot of different reasons, we have seen the volume 
of timber sales decrease. The last information I saw was that 
80 different units had failed to meet their harvest targets in 
the last 5 years.
    And, the Black Hills National Forest, this is important to 
us. We were proud to host the first Federal timber sale in 
1899. We have been dealing with these issues for a long time. 
What can we do together to better provide these forests the 
treatment that they need?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I think there are two issues here. 
One is the forest itself, and I think our Wildfire Crisis 
Strategy is directly designed to increase activity where it 
needs to be increased in order to reduce the risk of 
catastrophic fire, and so continuing to invest in that system 
is important. You provided a down payment with your Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law. That is going to take us through a couple 
of years, but, as you know, this is going to take a decade or 
more of commitment. So that is number one.
    Number two is making sure that we also have activities for 
our mills. I know that that has been an issue particularly in 
the Black Forest area, which is why we are literally 
transporting wood from the western states to that mill in South 
Dakota so that it maintains viability. We are continuing to do 
that.
    Mr. Johnson. And I do want to give you kudos for that, Mr. 
Secretary. When I had first heard the concept, the idea that 
there would be timber from elsewhere brought in, I thought 
there is no way the bureaucracy is going to make that happen. 
And the fact that it has happened, I think, is a testament to 
you and your team. I think Chris French and others have done a 
good job of telling me that you all want to get these things 
done, these things meaning more timber sales, more treatments 
so we can have healthier forests. I think there are still 
just--it seems like there are a lot of holdups. It feels like 
there is some bureaucracy maybe further down the food chain, 
and so I am going to continue to look forward to working with 
you and your team to do what we can to maybe hit more of the 
center of the target.
    I also want to talk a little bit about high-path. I mean, 
obviously, this country has got a lot of great poultry 
producers. And in South Dakota, we have a lot of turkeys, we 
have a lot of pheasants. We have seen, as a country, 81 million 
dead birds as a result of high-path. I mean, I think it is a 
terrible situation, just devastating the industry and 
devastating to these growers that, as of right now, are the 
only real solution when we have an outbreak is a total depop. 
Talk to us a little bit, Mr. Secretary, about are we getting 
closer to developing a vaccine solution that would not unduly 
harm trade so that we can have some alternative to total depop?
    Secretary Vilsack. Representative, you have asked a pretty 
tricky question there by adding that trade piece because there 
is clearly a distinction between if you are a broiler and the 
broiler industry, that is a concern. If you are in the turkey 
industry or the egg-laying industry, you are in a different 
place.
    Here is where we are with vaccines. I would say we are 
probably 18 months or so away from being able to identify a 
vaccine that would be effective for this particular HPAI that 
we are dealing with now. The problem, of course, is it mutates, 
and so you have to basically create ultimately a vaccine that 
is available for all strains, right? So there is that issue.
    The second issue is how do you deliver the vaccine? Do you 
deliver it in a way that is efficient and effective and less 
expensive or is an injection required? Well, when you are 
talking about hundreds of thousands of birds, that is 
difficult, so we are trying to develop that process for 
distributing the vaccine.
    Then the other issue is whether or not you can get to a 
point where, by vaccinating, you can distinguish between a bird 
that has been vaccinated versus a bird that is actually sick, 
and we are working on that. So we have work to do. There is a 
commitment to get it done. There is a commitment to begin the 
conversation on the trade side, to begin asking our trading 
partners, how do you feel about this, what are your concerns 
about it, so that we eventually, sometime down the road, get to 
a point where I think you want us to be. But it is going to 
take--it is very complex, and it is going to take some time.
    Mr. Johnson. So you are talking 12 to 18 months?
    Secretary Vilsack. Twelve to 18 months just to get the 
vaccine for this particular type, not that is true for every 
type. We still have work to be done on how to actually 
administer it, and we are nowhere near being able to do it from 
a standpoint of the impact of trade. We would have a 
circumstance where, if we vaccinated today, I think we would 
have a number of our trading partners saying we are not 
interested in your chickens.
    Mr. Johnson. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
    The Chairman. The gentleman yields back. I am now pleased 
to recognize Ms. Adams from North Carolina for 5 minutes of 
questions.
    Ms. Adams. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you as well 
to the Ranking Member.
    Good morning, Secretary Vilsack.
    Secretary Vilsack. Good morning.
    Ms. Adams. Thank you for coming back to testify. I do 
appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. I appreciate the 
range of issues that you have raised today, and I want to 
follow up on them again, equity in USDA and in agriculture, 
USDA's purchasing power, addressing competition, and 
distributing resources to distressed and disadvantaged farmers 
via the IRA.
    But I especially appreciate you naming food insecurity as 
an issue because I want to address something that we have been 
hearing in and around this Committee as we approach a farm 
bill. Recent pay-for proposals have suggested that requiring 
the Thrifty Food Plan be held cost-neutral in future 
evaluations would save something like $30 billion over a 10 
year projection. These proposals have been accompanied by a 
talking point that that says not a single recipient of SNAP 
will lose benefits. I worry that that is not true. Pulling cuts 
from future benefits and calling them savings, concluding that 
there will be no cuts I think it is just disingenuous.
    The Thrifty Food Plan is the backbone of SNAP as it helps 
to determine the amount of dollars that our neighbors who are 
enrolled in the program get each month as they face the harsh 
reality of inflation in the grocery checkout. In my district, 
participants in my Adams Hunger Initiative, who represent over 
30,000 people on SNAP, celebrated the long-overdue reevaluation 
of the Thrifty Food Plan in 2021 and they fear any threats to 
keeping Thrifty up to date in perpetuity could spell trouble.
    I understand that during previous Thrifty Food Plan 
revaluations, an administrative decision was made to hold them 
cost-neutral. And so the consequences of this decision resulted 
in absurd assumptions about how low-income families would have 
to stretch their food budgets. For example, prior to 2021, the 
Thrifty Food Plan assumed a weekly diet of a family of four 
would include 12 pounds of potatoes, 25 pounds of milk, 20 
pounds of orange juice, 5 pounds of fresh oranges, and I don't 
think any of us could reasonably eat a diet consisting 
substantially of potatoes, milk, oranges for long periods of 
time, let alone get our children to do that.
    So my question is how would holding future Thrifty Food 
Plan revaluations cost-neutral impact the ability of the 
Thrifty and therefore SNAP benefits to be based on a realistic 
food plan? And could it undermine our ability to improve the 
diet of SNAP participants by making it more and more difficult 
for them to afford more expensive, but critical foods like 
fruits and vegetables?
    Secretary Vilsack. The only data point I have, 
Congresswoman, is the fact that when we basically looked at the 
Thrifty Food Plan based on what actually is happening for 
American families at the grocery store, based on data that was 
specific, that was based on the scanner activities and 
information, what we saw was that we were under-funding, if you 
will, the foundation of the SNAP program to the tune of 20+ 
percent. So I think the challenge and the problem is if you try 
to maintain a steady course, you are essentially going to 
transition away from looking at what is happening at that 
particular time in grocery stores. And over time, you are going 
to create a benefit that will not adequately support the 
families that need the help.
    Ms. Adams. Okay. Well, thank you, sir. So switching gears a 
little bit, I am pleased to see the ongoing commitment to the 
1890 and 1994 land-grant universities included in your work on 
NextGen and your letters to Governors with Secretary Cardona 
about land-grant funding, because, for too long, these 
institutions have been under-funded. So can you discuss briefly 
how you would ensure that 1890s are being brought to the table 
in conversations about future research, education, and 
extension priorities?
    Secretary Vilsack. We have taken a look at ways in which we 
can incorporate historic black colleges, universities, and for 
that matter, all minority-serving institutions and many of our 
programs. They have taken full advantage of the Climate-Smart 
Commodity Partnership Initiative. You mentioned the NextGen 
program. Our Scholars Program is at record levels of 
participation. We have increased research. We have established 
more Centers of Excellence at HBCUs. Most recently, the 
precision nutrition effort at Southern University, we are 
looking at the possibility of establishing a veterinarian 
school at the Eastern Shore of Maryland. And so there are, I 
think, a lot of exciting opportunities for us to continue 
investing. We obviously need a budget, and we need a farm bill 
to be able to continue to do that.
    Ms. Adams. Great. Well, thank you very much. As a proud 
HBCU graduate 1890, 40 year professor at an HBCU, I appreciate 
all of your support. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    The Chairman. The gentlelady yields back. I now recognize 
the gentleman from Iowa, Mr. Feenstra, for 5 minutes of 
questioning.
    Mr. Feenstra. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, 
Secretary Vilsack, for being here. You and I have a lot of 
commonalities, obviously, you being our Governor for many 
years. And so I just want to talk about what is happening in 
Iowa a little bit, what I am hearing. I was in Buena Vista 
County, talked to the 250 pork producers on Friday evening. And 
I am hearing this all over. And you noted it. The first 
question that was talked about from our Chairman was Prop 12. 
And my question is, what are you hearing from our trading 
partners like Canada and other trading partners? Is the USDA 
concerned about trade disputes through USMCA? Is this going to 
be a big issue because of Prop 12?
    Secretary Vilsack. Congressman, it has been raised in our 
conversations with the Canadian Minister. They want to have 
some clarity and some indication of kind of how we are 
responding to this. Obviously, we are in the relatively early 
phases of all of this. I will tell you that we are looking at 
ways in which we can help and assist the pork industry. We know 
it is under a lot of stress, as you do.
    Mr. Feenstra. Yes.
    Secretary Vilsack. We recently purchased roughly $100 
million of pork products in our feeding programs using the CCC 
and section 32. The good news is we have seen a significant 
increase in pork exports.
    Mr. Feenstra. Yes.
    Secretary Vilsack. But there is obviously a lot of work 
still to do to try to help and assist them.
    Mr. Feenstra. Yes.
    Secretary Vilsack. I think we are going to go through a 
bumpy period here where farmers have to basically make a 
decision about whether they are going to participate in that 
market or whether they are going to be more localized. I think 
that is one of the reasons why we focused on building a local 
and regional food system so that you have an option, that you 
don't necessarily have to participate in a national system----
    Mr. Feenstra. Right.
    Secretary Vilsack.--that you actually have the opportunity 
to sell directly to your school, sell directly to an 
institutional purchaser like a university or a college. You 
have many of them in your district.
    Mr. Feenstra. Yes. Yes. And that is exactly right. I just 
want it on the forefront that this Prop 12 and we have to do 
our work, right in Congress. We have to pass something to 
preempt it.
    And you hit on something with trade. I mean, trade to me 
is--when you start looking at our corn commodity and we are 
growing so much extra corn, obviously, that goes to ethanol, 
but that gets hurt by trade. We have a lot of pork going to 
Mexico and stuff. And yet, I look at the Administration and say 
we haven't had any new free trade agreements in the last 3 
years. I mean, where do you see--I mean, how can USDA help on 
the free trade agreements, and how can we expand export 
markets? Because to me, we are doing amazing things growing the 
product, but we don't have places for it to go. And that being 
said, there is a lot of competition. We are seeing a lot of our 
competitors claiming some of the export markets that we used to 
have.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I would say a couple of things. 
First of all, one of the reasons why the competition is steeper 
is because folks in the past, in our competition, invested more 
fully and completely in their infrastructure and allowed them 
to essentially squeeze the difference and the gap that we once 
had. Fortunately for us, we have the Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Law that is going to allow us to reclaim that competitive edge, 
number one.
    Number two, the reality is I have a hard time understanding 
the focus on trade agreements when I am pretty confident--and 
maybe I am wrong about this--but do you believe that you can 
pass trade promotion authority in this Congress? You haven't 
been able to pass a budget. You haven't gotten a farm bill 
through. Can you pass trade promotion authority? And if you 
can't, why not? And I think the reason why not is because 
people have an attitude about trade that requires us to rebuild 
people's trust in trade. Farmers understand it. They absolutely 
understand it, not the rest of the country.
    Mr. Feenstra. No, and it is a huge deal. I just looked at--
I was in the UK. They are doing individual trade agreements on 
ag with Kansas and other states and stuff like that. I just 
wish our Federal Government was a little more engaged, 
Katherine Tai, we have talked about and stuff like that, and--
--
    Secretary Vilsack. We are engaged. But it is not just trade 
agreements. It is breaking down barriers.
    Mr. Feenstra. Yes.
    Secretary Vilsack. And I mentioned this earlier. A lot of 
trade wins have occurred, don't get the headlines, but they 
have occurred. We have $21 billion of trade wins in the last 3 
years.
    The other issue is China. And let's be honest about this. I 
spoke to the co-op entity yesterday, and I asked them to 
identify their number one customer, and then I asked this 
question. If you started criticizing your number one customer 
how long would you be able to have that number one customer?
    Mr. Feenstra. Right. Good point. Hey, I got one more 
question for you. When we think of high-path, African Swine 
Fever, and foot-and-mouth, obviously, going back to hogs--I got 
17 seconds left--do you feel confident that we are prepared? I 
mean, this is----
    Secretary Vilsack. I do.
    Mr. Feenstra. Okay.
    Secretary Vilsack. I do. I do. I do because we have good 
people assuring it doesn't get into the country, and we have 
good people who are doing the research and the vaccine and all 
of that.
    Mr. Feenstra. Okay.
    Secretary Vilsack. So, we are going to have it in 
Manhattan, Kansas at our NBAF, and I am confident.
    Mr. Feenstra. Good. Thank you.
    The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired. I now 
recognize the gentlelady from Texas, Congresswoman Crockett, 
for 5 minutes of questioning.
    Ms. Crockett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Mr. 
Secretary, for your time.
    There are a lot of things that you have been asked today, 
and you clearly have a lot on your plate, so I am going to 
stick to one subject matter that is crucial to all families 
that House Democrats are committed to upholding in this farm 
bill, nutrition. At the USDA, you award billions of dollars 
annually to support the nutritional needs of Americans from all 
walks of life. I especially want to commend your repeated 
commitment across USDA leadership to supporting nutrition 
programs that serve all Americans regardless of their 
circumstances. But with so much on your plate, there are some 
things that can fall through the cracks. In particular, I am 
referring to GusNIP and produce prescription programs. These 
programs provide critical assistance to Americans that need to 
stretch their SNAP dollars further and those that face medical 
complications from poor nutrition.
    But in each of these programs, not all fruits and 
vegetables are treated the same. Under current USDA policy, 
fresh fruits and vegetables receive more favorable 
consideration than frozen despite the best science showing no 
nutritional difference. I am concerned by this because we know 
that frozen is often better for folk who most need nutrition 
assistance because it keeps for longer and provides more 
variety. Now, I have no issue with fresh, so don't get me 
wrong, but if we want these programs to be accessible and be 
accessible for as many people as possible, we should have 
parity between fresh and frozen.
    That is why I introduced the bipartisan SHOPP Act (H.R. 
3127) with Congressman Alford, which now has 22 House 
cosponsors and four supporters in the Senate. And if I recall 
correctly, when Congressman Rose asked you about the lack of 
parity on fresh and frozen in these programs last year, you 
said you would get back to us.
    So my question, Mr. Secretary, is whether you will commit 
to increasing equity in these programs by evaluating 
establishing parity between fresh and frozen fruits and 
vegetables in GusNIP and the Produce Prescription Program?
    Secretary Vilsack. Congresswoman, I am happy to commit to 
encouraging those who use our nutrition programs to consider 
and to participate in fruit and vegetable consumption. I would 
be more than happy to talk to you about what parity means and 
how it would act and react in terms of our Prescription Produce 
Program, for example, where we are working with pediatricians 
and physicians, how it would work with our GusNIP program where 
we essentially provide resources, how it would work at farmers' 
markets where it probably wouldn't because it is mostly fresh 
fruit and vegetable. There isn't any frozen vegetables 
available, so when you promote a farmers' market, are you 
suggesting we not promote the farmers' market because it 
doesn't have frozen?
    Ms. Crockett. No, what I would say is that I have a 
district where 20 percent of my district live at or below 
poverty. And because of that, my district probably in a 
disproportionate way is in more need of access to fruits and 
vegetables. But what we typically see is in underserved 
communities they don't necessarily have the big grocers, so I 
don't--I have so many food deserts in my district. And so what 
happens is they don't necessarily always have grocery stores, 
and if they do have grocery stores, those grocery stores don't 
necessarily have fresh fruits and veggies. So if it is a matter 
of I can use my SNAP benefits so that I can get fresh broccoli, 
but the only place that I can go to maybe is the convenience 
store that is down the street and the convenience store has 
frozen broccoli, why is it that I can't go to the convenience 
store? What is going to happen is I am now put into a situation 
where I now have to go to an area in which they have fresh 
fruits and veggies instead of being able to use----
    Secretary Vilsack. I am more than happy to work with you on 
that issue. That is a slightly different issue and has slightly 
different responses. One is basically taking a look at what 
convenience stores have to offer in order to be able to qualify 
for the SNAP program. The other aspect of this is how we might 
be able to use the Healthy Food Financing Initiative that 
supports corner stores, creating broader access to healthier 
foods, how we might be able to work together to make sure that 
frozen vegetables are part of what they are able to provide.
    Ms. Crockett. And I thank you for that. I use that as just 
a general example, but overall, even if it is another grocery 
store, I would want people to be able to choose frozen because 
some of those grocery stores don't necessarily have, I would 
say, the most appetizing fresh food sometimes.
    But I am going to move on to another issue that is 
specifically super important to Texas, and that is the Summer 
EBT program. For whatever reason, my home State of Texas is 
having some problems standing that up, and I would like if you 
could update me on what other states are refusing to feed 
children during the summertime.
    Secretary Vilsack. There are 14 states, and we will get you 
a list. Nebraska just recently decided to come into the 
program, so 14 states.
    Ms. Crockett. Thank you.
    The Chairman. The gentlelady yields back. I am now pleased 
to recognize the gentleman from Kansas, Mr. Mann, for 5 minutes 
of questioning.
    Mr. Mann. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Secretary, thank 
you for being here this morning.
    As you know, I represent the big first district in Kansas, 
the number one beef, sorghum, and wheat-producing district in 
the country. As the Subcommittee Chairman for the Livestock, 
Dairy, and Poultry Subcommittee here, I am concerned with 
several proposed rules that would impose nonsensical and costly 
regulations on ag producers in my district and across the 
country, from USDA's Packers and Stockyards rules, which extend 
well beyond the bounds of Congressional intent and ignore legal 
precedent, to the new USDA Food Safety Inspection Service's 
Salmonella regulatory framework, which has left the industry 
scrambling for answers. My view is the Federal Government 
should either support producers or get out of their way. I look 
forward to working with my colleagues to craft and maintain 
sound, comprehensive livestock policy that honors the work of 
every link of the animal agriculture supply chain.
    Mr. Secretary, first question, on January 24 APHIS sent a 
final rule out to OMB that would require electronic 
identification ear tags for animal disease traceability and as 
a requisite for official interstate movement of certain cattle 
and bison. And I understand the goals here. I guess my question 
is what are USDA's plans for mitigating the cost to producers 
and other entities like sale barns to comply with the rule?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, this is really, I think, an 
investment to support and preserve market opportunities because 
if we have a problem and we can't trace it back quickly, it 
destroys the entire market. So I would think that this is a 
relatively small cost associated with this. And the reality is 
if Congress wants to provide us the resources to provide 
reimbursement, more than happy to do that. But this is a very 
important, I think, market-protective measure to ensure that we 
can respond quickly to an outbreak, whatever it might be, to be 
able to isolate, quarantine, and prevent an entire market 
destruction.
    Mr. Mann. Yes, and I agree. We just got to think through 
how does that impact our producers on the ground?
    Second question, as we work to prevent animal disease 
outbreaks here at home, we also have to protect the U.S. food 
supply against introduction of diseases from our trading 
partners. The USDA recently issued a final rule allowing for 
the importation of beef from Paraguay, despite Paraguay's long 
history of foot-and-mouth disease. Does Paraguay, in your view, 
have the necessary means to fund its foot-and-mouth disease 
mitigation measures, and how will USDA ensure there is no lapse 
in safety mitigation measures in Paraguay?
    Secretary Vilsack. We spent 8 years looking at this issue. 
I have a lot of faith and confidence in the people that work 
for APHIS. There have been multiple audits of their system. We 
are convinced that their system is equivalent in terms of their 
ability to detect, their ability to quarantine, their ability 
to respond quickly. We also have put a series of conditions on 
the importation. The beef can't come from a facility that has 
ever, ever had any FMD. It can't come from a region that has 
had FMD last year. It is inspected both before and after 
slaughter. So we are confident that we have a system that that 
will ensure protection. And I think I have to have confidence 
in the APHIS folks when they tell me after 8 years of study 
they are equivalent.
    Mr. Mann. Okay. Last question is likely, I am sure you know 
the EPA recently proposed a rule that would impact the effluent 
limitation guidelines and standards for meat and poultry 
processing facilities. By EPA's own estimates, this rule could 
potentially close between 16 and 53 meat, poultry, and 
rendering facilities. Meanwhile, USDA has spent hundreds of 
millions of dollars to expand meat and poultry processing 
capacity. Did the EPA consult with USDA on the impacts of this 
rule prior to its publication, and how do you plan to engage 
with the EPA on this moving forward?
    Secretary Vilsack. We provided information and data in an 
effort to try to bolster the least restrictive option. There 
are three options, as you know, that they have proposed. We 
provided information in an effort to try to bolster the least 
restrictive option that they have identified.
    Mr. Mann. Yes, big picture, it is frustrating for me, and 
taxpayers when we are spending all this money to try to improve 
capacity and enhance capacity, which we should. At the same 
time, the EPA is putting on regulations. I understand that it 
is the EPA and not the USDA. We are pushing on the door on one 
side and pulling on it on the other.
    Last question with the last 30 seconds, one thing I am 
really passionate about is our Food for Peace program and the 
notion of using American-grown commodities to feed hungry 
people around the world. Can you speak to the importance of 
using U.S.-grown commodities in our international food aid 
programs, which is obviously also authorized in the farm bill?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, it is a critical component of the 
McGovern-Dole. It is a critical component of Food for Progress. 
It is a critical component of the Bill Emerson Trust if we get 
it replenished. So it is obviously a very significant tool that 
we have to try to address global food insecurity.
    Mr. Mann. Yes, I agree. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield 
back.
    The Chairman. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize 
the gentleman from California, Mr. Carbajal, for 5 minutes of 
questioning.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, 
Secretary Vilsack, for being here.
    If anybody knows the Federal Government and the USDA and 
even Congress, it is you, and so I really appreciate your 
wisdom and your leadership in the capacity that you are in.
    I also understand why you are so smart. You have a former 
staffer of mine that you hired, Erin Sandlin, so I definitely 
know you are in good hands.
    Secretary Vilsack, I represent what many people call 
Paradise on Earth, the Central Coast of California, where 
agriculture is the number one industry. When I meet with the 
growers and producers in my district, they consistently bring 
up labor shortages. I believe we agree that finally getting the 
bipartisan Farm Workforce Modernization Act enacted into law is 
essential and that there are also additional tools that would 
help farmers with their labor challenges, including many that 
are within USDA's purview. How can we support producers through 
the farm bill to address labor shortages? And could investments 
in research like mechanization or future workforce development 
be helpful?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I think a lot of producers are 
looking at robotics in an effort to try to make their systems 
more efficient. I think in the meantime, we have started at 
USDA a Farm Labor Stabilization Initiative, a pilot. We took 
$65 million from the American Rescue Plan, we put it on the 
table, and we asked producers of all sizes, large and small, 
what would they do with this resource to recruit and retain a 
workforce from the Northern Triangle countries and Mexico? We 
were actually impressed with the reaction and response to this. 
We got applications from entities that wanted just a couple of 
workers to entities that wanted hundreds of workers. And each 
and every single one of them, we also gave them options of a 
very basic program or sort of a silver and gold program where 
the working conditions, the wage levels, and so forth would be 
significantly higher. I expected that the base program would be 
the more popular program in terms of application. It turns out 
that, no, people were more interested in the silver and gold 
programs. We had far more applications in that space. So it is 
important, I think, for us to take a look at what we learned 
from that experience and maybe that can help inform policy in 
the future.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. Mr. Secretary, climate change 
continues to be an issue for farmers and growers throughout the 
country. As you may recall, last year at this time, atmospheric 
storms hit the Central Coast of California, leaving an 
estimated $2.4 billion in damages and crop loss. Once again, 
the Central Coast was hit with storms earlier this month. What 
disaster reforms can Congress do in this upcoming farm bill to 
help protect producers against climate change?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I think there are a couple things. 
I think, obviously, we are going to learn a lot from the 
Climate-Smart Agricultural Commodity Initiative in terms of 
strategies, conservation programs that farmers can use to make 
their farms more resilient and so would encourage learning from 
that experience and also preserving the IRA resources, 
conservation resources.
    I think the Chairman is right in his concern about disaster 
and trying to get away from the ad hoc programs that we have 
had in the past. Sometimes, they are adequately funded, and 
sometimes, they are not. To have a more permanent disaster 
assistance program would provide some predictability and 
stability in that area and I would certainly look forward to 
working with everyone to try to figure out what that looks 
like.
    In addition, I think it is important for us to look at crop 
insurance. I think it continues to be a very important 
mechanism. We have seen an expansion, a significant expansion 
of the number of policies, the number of commodities that are 
now covered by crop insurance that weren't a couple of years 
ago, modifications to the programs, ways in which the risk 
management tool can be used to encourage the kinds of actions 
and steps on the farm that create greater resilience, so I 
think there are a combination of things that we need to 
probably look at.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. I will just say that crop 
insurance needs to also make sure that it grows in the areas of 
specialty crops, which oftentimes are left behind.
    Secretary Vilsack. And that is where we have seen 
significant expansion recently.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. As you mentioned in your testimony 
that food insecurity remains more common in rural areas than in 
the suburban areas. Can you address the misconception that SNAP 
is a program predominantly used in cities, and elaborate how 
SNAP supports rural communities and combats food insecurity in 
those regions?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, there is no question that poverty 
is not concentrated in one part of the country. There are many, 
many remote areas and rural areas of very significant and deep 
poverty. In fact, the persistently poor counties, the majority 
of persistently poor counties, counties that have experienced 
more than 20 percent of poverty over decades, are located in 
rural communities. And so there are a series of programs--I see 
the time is up, but there are a series of programs that we have 
identified, trying to address those issues.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Secretary Vilsack. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield back.
    The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired. I now 
recognize the gentlelady from Illinois, Mrs. Miller, for 5 
minutes of questioning.
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois. Secretary Vilsack, I am sure you 
have seen by now countries all over Europe are facing protests 
from farmers because left-wing governments are trying to 
destroy the ag industry to advance the climate change agenda. 
These farmers are tired of top-down policies intended to 
appease the left's climate cult, which make it harder for them 
to farm and feed the world.
    The Biden Administration has taken similar steps to push 
this radical climate scam. From reentering the Paris Climate 
Agreement to the EPA trying to make it harder for farmers to 
use pesticides to Biden's attack on American fossil fuels, this 
Administration's policies threaten our farmers. The agriculture 
industry needs the ability to access affordable diesel, 
nitrogen, fertilizer, and pesticides. President Biden puts that 
ability in jeopardy. In a report published last week by the 
Buckeye Institute, they estimate Biden's climate policies will 
increase farm costs by approximately 34 percent and increase 
grocery prices drastically for Americans.
    To make matters worse, Mr. Secretary, you traveled to the 
U.N. Climate Change Conference and told attendees that the USDA 
wants to quantify and track carbon sequestration and greenhouse 
gas emissions of farmers. Mr. Secretary, are you aware of the 
report from the Buckeye Institute estimating Biden's climate 
policies will increase farm costs by 34 percent and thus 
increase grocery prices?
    Secretary Vilsack. I am not aware of that study, but I am 
aware of the reaction of the farm community to our Climate-
Smart Commodity Partnership Initiative, which is fundamentally 
different than what is happening in Europe. It is fundamentally 
different.
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois. Sir, I can tell you----
    Secretary Vilsack. It is voluntary----
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois.--I am actually a farmer in 
Illinois.
    Secretary Vilsack. It is----
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois. I can tell you the majority of 
farmers are not on board with this climate cult agenda.
    Secretary Vilsack. We had 1,000----
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois. And that the Biden Administration 
is wildly incentivizing these policies, and I can tell you, if 
all things were equal, farmers would rather plant corn than put 
a solar panel on the best farm ground in the world.
    Secretary Vilsack. That is not what this is, ma'am. That is 
not what this is, Congresswoman. This----
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois. So, sir, John Kerry said we can't 
get to net zero. We don't get this job done unless agriculture 
is front and center as part of the solution. Do you agree with 
John Kerry that we have to get farmers to net zero?
    Secretary Vilsack. I agree that that is an opportunity for 
farmers to make more money and for small- and mid-sized 
producers to actually stay on the farm.
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois. Okay. This is a disaster for 
farmers when you are incentivizing them to put----
    Secretary Vilsack. Farmers want this.
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois.--solar panels on the best farm 
ground in the world.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well----
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois. What is this going to do to our 
ability to feed people? Not only that, those solar panels do 
nothing but help our adversary China. And going by the climate 
cult's own practices, China is using coal to produce these 
solar panels. And we don't have a reclamation plan. And not 
only that, it is messing up--when farmers are in competition or 
have to rent their land and you have people that are getting 
subsidies from the government making three times as much as a 
farmer makes, of course, you have some farmers that are signing 
up. The profit margin is so narrow on farms, you are forcing 
farmers into this. Look what is happening in Europe. And what I 
want to know is who is standing up for the farmers? Who is 
advocating for the farmers? Have you ever discussed agriculture 
or climate policy with John Kerry?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, of course I have, and I have also 
discussed it with farmers. We had----
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois. Oh, what was your discussion 
with----
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, let me answer the----
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois.--John Kerry, sir?
    Secretary Vilsack. Ma'am, I am happy----
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois. I would like to know what you 
discussed with John Kerry.
    Secretary Vilsack. I am happy----
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois. Because you are advocating for the 
farmers. We need you to advocate for farmers----
    Secretary Vilsack. I am.
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois.--and for the people that have to 
turn around and buy the food at inflated prices if these 
radical policies are put in place.
    Secretary Vilsack. Our program is voluntary. It is 
incentive-based. It is market-driven. It is precisely what the 
Food and Agriculture Alliance, which is made up of----
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois. Okay.
    Secretary Vilsack.--80 large organizations, Farm Bureau, 
National Farmers Union, every major commodity group has 
requested----
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois. In Europe----
    Secretary Vilsack.--destruction of----
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois.--the rug has been----
    Secretary Vilsack. This is not Europe.
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois.--pulled out on the farmers----
    Secretary Vilsack. Ma'am, this is not Europe.
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois.--because they----
    Secretary Vilsack. This is not Europe. This is completely--
--
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois. Okay.
    Secretary Vilsack.--different than Europe.
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois. No one is on the side of American 
farmers but----
    Secretary Vilsack. You need to----
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois.--this Committee.
    Secretary Vilsack. You need to learn about this.
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois. The Biden Administration has done 
everything in their power to attack the family farm. We are not 
going to let you jeopardize our nation's food supply for the 
climate change agenda.
    Secretary Vilsack. That is not true. That is not true. We 
are doing what farmers have asked us to do. You need to sort of 
study up on this because it is not in Europe. It is not--it 
is----
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois. Sir, I am a farmer.
    Secretary Vilsack.--completely opposite of Europe.
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois. The farmers want policies, okay. 
Thank you, and I yield back.
    The Chairman. The gentlelady's time has expired. I now 
recognize the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Bishop, for 5 minutes 
of questioning.
    Mr. Bishop. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Secretary, as you know, fuel and energy expenses are 
still at historic highs, and producers in Georgia's 2nd 
District are concerned with how the farm safety net will 
perform now that commodity prices are falling while input costs 
remain elevated. But 700 small businesses and ag producers have 
found relief through USDA's Rural Energy for America Program, 
the REAP program, just last year alone. These energy efficiency 
improvements and renewable energy investments are helping 
farmers and business owners across rural America lower their 
energy costs. Can you talk about the impact of this program on 
operating margins for our farmers and our ranchers, and what 
about small business owners in rural areas like those in 
Georgia's 2nd Congressional district?
    The second question has to do with rural development, one 
of my top priorities, so thank you for highlighting the 
investments in water and sewer infrastructure in your 
testimony. You also recognize USDA's Emergency Rural Health 
Care grants as a program that is vitally helping more 
communities maintain access to healthcare with over 800 grants 
reaching more than 22 million people. Can you tell us what the 
Administration has learned and what trends you have seen 
related to both infrastructure and in healthcare and what 
suggestions or lessons you can share with Congress from the 
Emergency Rural Health Care grants that we can implement moving 
forward?
    Finally, Mr. Secretary, you identified the impact of 
potential cuts in our annual appropriations. If we are not able 
to enact 4 year bills for Fiscal Year 2024 at the levels in the 
Bipartisan Budget Agreement, we could be looking at 
sequestration or a full-year continuing resolution. With such a 
tough environment, can you tell us what is at stake, the impact 
of sequestration to mothers and children who rely on USDA food 
assistance, to our farmers and our ranchers across the country, 
to our producers who rely on technical assistance from 
extension agencies, from NRCS, and to those who have housing or 
business loans with the USDA? And what about the impact of a 
full-year continuing resolution?
    Secretary Vilsack. I will try to respond to all three of 
those questions.
    On the REAP program, we have had over 5,000 grants awarded. 
Many of these grants not only reduce the cost to a producer or 
to a small business, but they also, for producers, create an 
income source. What is interesting about this is--so a Rhode 
Island producer who has basically invested in a renewable 
energy program where he is selling excess energy on the grid, 
so it not only reduces his cost, but also creates a new income 
source. We want to obviously see more of that. And again, it is 
voluntary. People can apply for it if they wish, and we are 
excited about the opportunity to see more grants in the future.
    On healthcare, listen, this is about basically continuing 
to invest in our Community Facilities Program and our 
telemedicine program, our ability to basically help and assist 
small communities equip or build hospital complexes and/or 
provide services, levels of services through telemedicine. 
These are two very popular programs. The emergency care program 
was funded through the pandemic assistance. To the extent that 
you wanted that to continue, that would require an additional 
appropriation. But in the meantime, at the very least, continue 
to fund the Community Facilities Program because that is a 
tremendously flexible opportunity.
    On the budget, yes, I understand--I am getting the budget--
I think I am doing a pretty good job here actually. On the 
budget, look if you cut the budget, you have less services, you 
have less people. It is really that simple. You didn't expect 
me to be that quick.
    Mr. Bishop. What is the impact of a full-year continuing 
resolution or for sequestration?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, the problem with the continuing 
resolution, I mean, it is essentially the same because you are 
not going to get--if you get a continuing resolution based on 
the debt ceiling deal, you are going to see a reduction in the 
overall budget, and so therefore, you are going to see a 
reduction in services and a reduction in people. I mean, it is 
just that simple.
    We are operating right now--historically, we have received 
less of the nondiscretionary defense spending than many of the 
other agencies, so whenever we receive a reduction or a 
flatline budget, it really stresses things.
    Mr. Bishop. The backlog on SNAP applications in Georgia, 
the state is failing to meet the application processing 
timeline requirements. Can you commit to working with us to try 
to give states more flexibility such as eliminating the face-
to-face interview to clear the backlog and making backlogs more 
transparent to the applicants so that they know that they may 
have to wait months in order to get the benefit?
    Secretary Vilsack. With respect, that is not the answer. 
The answer is not to sacrifice integrity of the program. Those 
face-to-face interviews are very important. It is for Georgia 
to use the resources they have available to have the staff 
adequately to run the program, and that is what we have asked 
Governor Kemp to do.
    Mr. Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.
    The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired. I now 
recognize the gentleman from Alabama, Congressman Moore, for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Moore. Thank you, Chairman Thompson and Secretary 
Vilsack. Good to see you again. I would like to first thank you 
for being here today and for the work that the Department of 
Agriculture does for our farmers, ranchers, and foresters 
across America.
    As I am sure you know, farm programs and safety net 
programs are important to Alabama agriculture. Improvements to 
our nation's farm policy and ensuring timely farm bill 
reauthorization is certainly a top priority of mine and the 
producers that I represent in lower Alabama. Much like my 
colleagues here today and you as well, I look forward to seeing 
a timely farm bill authorization, increasing reference prices, 
and sharing programmatic integrity for SNAP and other Federal 
assistance programs and promoting wood product industries are 
top priorities for me in the reauthorization process and the 
livelihood of those I represent.
    Wiregrass producers in western Alabama are struggling to 
stay whole after a serious drought in recent months. Peanut 
producers are feeling a pinch of slimmer-than-ever margins and 
are only met with resistance by our Democratic counterparts 
when any suggestion is made to adjust Title I to meet the needs 
of modern-day production. It is disappointing that these 
producers do not feel supported by the current Administration 
we have in place and who would rather play favorites with ERP, 
grab every tax dollar they can for SNAP, and pander to radical 
social environmental justice agendas. It seems the agency is 
putting politics before policy, and quite frankly, our farmers, 
ranchers, foresters in rural communities certainly deserve 
better.
    The first question I have is Executive action at the 
Environmental Protection Agency, General Services 
Administration, Department of the Interior have recently been 
announced which are adverse or do not consider the work of your 
agency and its constituents. Secretary Vilsack, how are you 
making a good-faith attempt to give agriculture a voice across 
this Executive Branch?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I have an ongoing relationship 
with the Secretaries of each one of those departments, and we 
are in constant communication about policies and issues that 
they are adopting that may have an impact on agriculture, and 
we provide input. I am certainly not going to be in a position 
to tell them what they should do in their department. I don't 
want them telling me what I should do in my department. But we 
do provide input. We do provide data. We do provide the 
consequences of what they are considering on American 
agriculture. That is our job. And then once a decision is made 
by another department, to the extent that we can, we use the 
resources of USDA to try to mitigate the consequences of that.
    Mr. Moore. I have heard the most terrifying words are, ``We 
are from the government, and we are here to help.'' And when I 
listen to you, as the Department head of Agriculture, the USDA, 
it seems like you are battling the Department of Labor for 
production of food or you are battling maybe the EPA to get 
them off the backs of local producers. And so would that be 
true, Mr. Vilsack, that probably the most terrifying words that 
you ever hear is, ``We are from the government, and we are here 
to help?''
    Secretary Vilsack. Let me say something about that. Yes, 
you know what, and I think government does help. When the 
farmers--the crop insurance programs, the disaster assistance 
programs, the ARC, the PLC, the wide variety of programs that 
you are discussing in the farm bill, that is government 
helping. I think that the challenge is we want to make sure the 
government is helping and is efficient in the way that are 
helping.
    Mr. Moore. And to your defense, I think you are trying to 
do the job. Sometimes, I don't agree with the policies that are 
implemented, and I certainly am not a big friend of some of the 
environmental stuff that is going on. But it seems like to me 
that your own government is your biggest issue sometime in 
trying to actually help the producers in America. And, I 
appreciate you being in the fight for us. I hope you will 
continue that. I am sure you will. But for me it--more so when 
I listen to you talk about the Department of Labor, these 
regulations that you have to try to jump through these hoops so 
we can have food on the tables of American consumers, to me, I 
almost start to understand that the battle you are in is the 
same battle we are in many days here is how to stop the 
bureaucracy and take care of the people.
    And so let me do one more question here, sir. I got one 
question. I am running out of time. So this past June, the 
Department announced SNAP's error rate, a rate that measured 
overpayments and underpayments. This announcement included an 
overpayment rate of 9.54 percent, which amounts to roughly $30 
million a day. Certainly, that would be an insult, Mr. Vilsack, 
to our taxpayers. What concrete, serious, and forward-thinking 
steps are on the horizon?
    Secretary Vilsack. States basically administer the program. 
We are working with state Governors to make sure that they 
understand they need to get back to a more disciplined effort 
in terms of SNAP. We sort of relaxed the flexibilities or 
created flexibilities during the pandemic, and we are now 
asking them to go back to the ordinary work of administering 
SNAP, which involves, to Representative Bishop's question, 
face-to-face interviews, which I think will be helpful to 
restore integrity in the program. So we are encouraging 
Governors. And Governors, if they fail to respond, there are 
sanctions that can essentially be put in place. We are 
concerned about this, and we should be.
    Mr. Moore. Yes, we should. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Mr. 
Chairman, I will yield back.
    The Chairman. The gentleman yields back. I am now pleased 
to recognize the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Soto, for 5 
minutes of questioning.
    Mr. Soto. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, 
Secretary, for being here today. I know it has been a long 
morning, and your thoughtful and candid answers to an onslaught 
of questions just reminds us that American agriculture is in 
good hands with your leadership.
    I visited ranchers, growers, and farmers across central 
Florida, as well as food banks and food pantries, and they 
spoke with one voice, which is can you please pass a farm bill? 
We have talked about how food inflation has dropped in half and 
continues to go down, but there is more work that we need to 
do. Is it your opinion that if we pass the farm bill, that 
would help in continuing to lower food costs in the nation?
    Secretary Vilsack. Yes, unless it involves restricting the 
utilization of the Commodity Credit Corporation. That is a tool 
that we use to help food banks deal with the increased need 
that is out there.
    Mr. Soto. So we need to continue to support programs like 
that, and we will continue to see food prices decline for the 
American consumer?
    Secretary Vilsack. Correct.
    Mr. Soto. In Florida, we have hurricanes that have only 
gotten worse over the years with climate change. Hurricane Ian 
recently led to over $1 billion in agricultural losses. We have 
passed out of this House a bipartisan disaster block grant 
authority. This is the top priority for Florida Farm Bureau. Do 
you think this would help going forward--I know the Senate 
didn't pass it yet--especially to help both the ranchers and 
particularly citrus as we face these increasing storms?
    Secretary Vilsack. We will be happy to administer it if it 
gets passed. Right now, we don't have the authority to do that. 
I know Florida is anxious to have it. If that is the wish of 
Congress, we will certainly follow it and do whatever we can to 
make sure it is administered properly.
    Mr. Soto. And, Mr. Secretary, we want to give you that 
authority.
    Also representing cattle country, I just wanted to stress 
the importance of continuing to invest in the National Vaccine 
Bank. That has come up several times for several different 
types of livestock. We have the largest herd in the nation in 
Deseret Ranch in our area, along with many other ranches and 
cow-calf operations, so that is really important.
    I have also visited places like Second Harvest in central 
Florida, our food bank that had to spend $2.5 million last year 
to fill the TEFAP gap. How critical to feeding America's 
families is The Emergency Food Assistance Program?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, it is essential. It is an 
essential tool that, when demand goes up or there is a regional 
tragedy that occurs, it is an opportunity for us to be able to 
respond quickly, to provide the resources for those food banks 
to meet the need. So it is critically important.
    Mr. Soto. Well, I have seen both seniors, children, the 
disabled, our veterans coming to these food banks to get 
healthy, nutritious food, and the TEFAP program has been 
absolutely critical for us.
    In addition, we are, after many years, finally turning the 
corner in Florida citrus. I appreciate your dedication over the 
years both under the Obama Administration, now under the Biden 
Administration to work with us on this research and development 
funding. We are seeing great advancements with new herbicides 
and pesticides that are helping out with new trees, especially 
injection. So I wanted to thank you for the waiver that you all 
provided to allow these areas to go forward.
    How critical is it for us to continue to make sure we have 
U.S.-grown citrus, whether it is orange juice from Florida or 
eating fruit from California and other areas, to protect 
America's vitamin C source?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I think it is connected to the 
health and welfare of Americans and specifically American 
children. We are trying to encourage more fruits and vegetable 
consumption and, obviously, to the extent that we do so, it 
would be nice if we can provide them something that is produced 
here in the U.S.
    Mr. Soto. Well, we are going to try to dig deep to get this 
done.
    The last thing I want to talk about is in my family's 
native island of Puerto Rico, along with many other 
Territories, they are under the NAP program, trying to move 
them to the SNAP program. First, Mr. Chairman, I would like to 
introduce a bipartisan letter from Representative Jenniffer 
Gonzalez-Colon and myself, just talking about the needs of the 
NAP program.
    The Chairman. Without objection.
    [The letter referred to is located on p. 172.]
    Mr. Soto. Thank you. There has been some debate about 
whether there needs to be legislation or just funding to 
convert NAP to SNAP. Do you happen to have any opinion on that 
or any advice on how we proceed going forward?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I think there is legislation that 
is required, but I think, more importantly, is making sure that 
Puerto Rico in particular is prepared for that transition. It 
is not a simple process to administer the SNAP program, and we 
have been working with officials in Puerto Rico to get them to 
a point where they are ready, willing, and able to administer 
the program effectively so their folks won't fall through the 
cracks.
    Mr. Soto. Well, we are absolutely thrilled by that. In 
central Florida, one in four of my constituents are fellow 
Puerto Ricans. We care deeply about what is happening on the 
island, as well as supporting our local growers, ranchers in 
cattle, citrus, blueberry, and strawberry country and making 
sure no central Florida family goes hungry. So I appreciate 
your leadership, Mr. Secretary, and thanks for being here.
    Secretary Vilsack. Thank you.
    The Chairman. The gentleman yields back. I am now pleased 
to recognize gentleman from Minnesota, Mr. Finstad, for 5 
minutes of questioning.
    Mr. Finstad. Thank you, Chairman Thompson, and thank you, 
Secretary Vilsack, for being here today and for your testimony.
    I am a proud fourth-generation farmer of southern 
Minnesota, excited to be raising the fifth, and just really 
proud of the fact that I am part of a very honorable profession 
that really is called to feed and fuel the world and to help 
support our communities, families, and really the country as a 
whole.
    Recently, your department released several concerning 
reports related to the current state of the farm economy. As 
you know, USDA's most recent projections found that the United 
States will experience an ag trade deficit of over $30.5 
billion this year. Last week, USDA's--your Economic Research 
Services forecast that in 2024 net farm income will drop by 
almost $40 billion. This is after close to a $30 billion 
decline in 2023.
    You should already be aware of who was leading the USDA the 
last time the farm income fell 2 years in a row. As a matter of 
fact, you oversaw 4 consecutive years of decreased farm income 
from 2012 to 2016. That is quite the resume. As I meet with 
producers across the 21 counties I represent in southern 
Minnesota, they are worried about a repeat performance with 
multiple years of decreased income. Yet today, you have 
downplayed farm income falling by 27 percent. Maybe you can 
stand to lose 27 percent of your income, Mr. Secretary, but the 
farmers I represent cannot.
    My producers are dealing with compounding effects of 
increased input costs, interest rates, supply chain challenges, 
and burdensome regulations, creating a highly leveraged 
financial environment in farm country. The hypocrisy of this 
Administration knows no bounds, and a prime example is your 
shifting positions on the ideal farm size in less than a 
decade.
    Every one of us that is not a farmer is not a farmer 
because we have farmers. We delegate the responsibility of 
feeding our families to a relatively small percentage of this 
country. If you look at 85 percent of what is grown in this 
country, it is raised by 200 to 300,000 people. That is less 
than \1/10\ of 1 percent of America. Those are your words from 
a 2016 Congressional hearing, Mr. Secretary. Yet in your 
testimony today you coldly dismiss these same family farms, who 
are the backbone of their rural communities as they work every 
day to feed and fuel the world.
    In the last 8 years, you seem to have forgotten that the 
small number of producers you now demonize are responsible for 
80 percent of the production. All Americans and Members of 
Congress should want to help small producers. I just think you 
don't have much appreciation for the operations that provide a 
majority of the food in this country with tight margins and 
greater risk.
    Farmers have continued to produce more with less by 
adopting innovation and increasing efficiencies, not because 
the government tells us to do it, but to remain competitive, to 
take care of our land, and to pass our farms down to the next 
generation.
    As farmers do every day for planning purposes, I did some 
back-of-the-napkin math. Effective reference prices are $4.01 
for corn, $9.26 for soybeans. December corn is $4.67 and 
November soybeans are $11.62. If we look at the break-even, it 
is about $5.10 for corn, $12 for soybeans. It doesn't take a 
mathematician to figure out reference prices as they stand 
today are really irrelevant. If crop prices were to fall to the 
level needed to trigger these reference prices and the safety 
net, farmers would be facing bankruptcy. So due to that fact, 
crop insurance is the number one risk management tool we have 
for farmers to succeed from working with their lender to making 
marketing decisions that really help us plan for farming of the 
future.
    Moreover, FSA loan-size limitations have not kept up with 
rising prices of farmland and these farm inputs. The current 
cap makes it more difficult for farmers, especially beginning 
farmers, to access FSA guaranteed loans for land purchases and 
operating expenses.
    Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit into the record an 
October 2023 study prepared by Texas A&M examining farm policy 
and its impact on farm families.
    The Chairman. Without objection.
    [The report referred to is located on p. 154.]
    Mr. Finstad. Mr. Secretary, you closed your testimony today 
by saying we can continue on the path that this Administration 
has taken that leads us to an even better and stronger rural 
America. I don't know about you, but if collapsing farm 
incomes, worsening trade deficits, increased regulatory burdens 
are your version of a better and stronger rural America, I 
think most farmers, including myself, would like to find a 
different path and, quite frankly, we call it hogwash.
    I will proudly stand up for farmers against the so-called 
leadership at USDA and across the Biden Administration looking 
to tear them down. Farm and food security is national security, 
and good farm policy isn't written by D.C. bureaucrats for D.C. 
bureaucrats. It is written by farmers in rural America for 
farmers in rural America.
    So, Mr. Secretary, actions speak louder than words, and 
your track record speaks for itself.
    Mr. Chairman, I have no questions, and I yield back.
    The Chairman. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize 
the gentleman from New Mexico, Mr. Vasquez, for 5 minutes of 
questioning.
    Mr. Vasquez. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman.
    Secretary Vilsack, thank you for being here today and for 
your testimony. Thank you for what you and the Department do 
for our farmers, our farmworkers, our ranchers, our ranch 
hands, and our ranch managers. I just want to make it clear 
that agriculture doesn't happen without the workers. And that 
is not just the owners, but that is the folks that are working 
the lands.
    Expanding access to nutrition programs in New Mexico is one 
of my top priorities. And New Mexico has the highest 
participation in SNAP in the nation. One in 40 New Mexicans 
rely on programs such as SNAP and WIC to have the basic 
nutrition to go to work and go to school. Children and families 
are hungry in our state, and they need food to thrive.
    Now, the irony in this, Secretary, is that we work hard, we 
wake up early, we put food on the table for the rest of the 
nation, and yet we are the ones who need these food assistance 
programs the most. We struggle with food insecurity. One in 
five children in my district faces hunger, and without access 
to this critical nutrition, parents cannot focus on going to 
work or going to school.
    Now, I recently heard from Sophia, a mother in Las Cruces, 
who goes to school while working full-time to ensure she can 
feed her family. Since the expanded SNAP benefits expired, she 
has struggled to feed her family while continuing her 
education. So it is clear to me that SNAP and WIC, when it 
comes to the entire equation of feeding our nation, are 
critical to strengthening food security for this country and 
strengthening our families.
    Secretary Vilsack, what more could we do to make sure that 
families like Sophia's, who are directly in charge of being the 
next generation of folks who are putting food on our tables, 
can have food security in one of the poorest states in the 
country?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I think, first of all, making sure 
that you are adequately funding the WIC program you mentioned. 
To the extent that that WIC program is under-funded, that would 
mean fewer people would be able to access it.
    I think, second, making sure that there are not 
restrictions on the SNAP program that would make it more 
difficult for people to qualify or more difficult for people to 
get the benefit that they need to provide supplemental 
assistance.
    I think, third, making sure that states understand the 
importance of taking steps to ensure that those who are 
qualified for the program actually participate. Unfortunately, 
sometimes there are circumstances and situations where states 
don't make a concerted effort to sign people up or to get 
people to participate in the program.
    And then I would say, in addition, making sure that the 
states that you are most concerned about are fully and 
completely focused on implementation of the Summer EBT program, 
which is going to provide additional resources to families for 
free and reduced lunch for children in school. I would say 
those are pretty significant opportunities as well to provide 
help.
    Mr. Vasquez. Thank you, Secretary. And I will just say one 
of the things that I have enjoyed most about serving on this 
Committee, along with my colleagues on the other side, is the 
bipartisan committee that we have set up to help modernize the 
farmworker system that we have for folks in this country, 
including H-2A and H-2B, of which we should have some 
recommendations for the rest of our colleagues, but also before 
your department and the Administration, that helps some of 
those both domestic producers and immigrant producers, the 
folks who are working at these very hard jobs, be able to have 
the opportunity to put food on the tables of Americans, so 
thank you for that.
    The other question I have is a little bit different. But 
you were recently in my district. You were in Albuquerque's 
South Valley. We were announcing a monumental investment in 
broadband for rural communities, $40 million for the State of 
New Mexico. Secretary, how can we make sure that those dollars 
are being spent in an efficient way that truly delivers the 
connectivity that rural communities need, including small and 
medium producers that can now take their businesses online and 
produce niche products that can help support rural economies? 
What are the plans for the Administration in terms of oversight 
and administration of these rural broadband dollars?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, each of the projects that are 
awarded resources have a team at USDA that follows the 
construction, the implementation of the grant to ensure that 
things are done in a proper way and a timely way. And so I can 
guarantee that that will take place for every one of the 
projects that we award resources to.
    I think the other issue, of course, is that there are other 
programs outside of USDA that I think are very important to 
keep an eye on, and that is the resources that are being 
provided to states and state Governors to basically fill in the 
gaps. Our program primarily is focused on improving the level 
of service that is available so that people actually have 
meaningful broadband access. We do serve underserved areas, but 
we also make sure that the level of service is adequate so that 
more than one person can be downloading something in a home, 
for example.
    Mr. Vasquez. Mr. Secretary, thank you for your investment 
in New Mexico. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman and now recognize the 
gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. Rose, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Rose. Thank you, Chairman Thompson, and thanks to 
Ranking Member Scott for holding the hearing, and thank you, 
Secretary Vilsack, for being with us today. As time is limited, 
I will dive right in.
    The Tennessee walking horse industry is a special industry 
that, frankly, is extremely important to my constituents and 
one that I value personally. Last summer during a farm bill 
listening session tour that Representative DesJarlais and I 
hosted in Tennessee, I, along with Representative DesJarlais, 
joined by Chairman Thompson and also Representative Jonathan 
Jackson, visited a walking horse stable facility.
    The Walking Horse Celebration is a time-honored tradition 
in Tennessee that began in 1939. Over 2,000 horses compete to 
be crowned the World Grand Champion, which is always crowned 
the Saturday night before Labor Day. I see you are writing that 
down. This year's celebration will be held August 21 through 
August 31 in Shelbyville, Tennessee. Mr. Secretary, I would 
like to extend a personal invitation for you to attend this 
unique event and experience firsthand this long-standing 
Tennessee tradition. Mr. Secretary, schedule permitting, would 
you be willing to consider attending this year's celebration?
    Secretary Vilsack. Be happy--they don't put me in charge of 
my schedule, Congressman. It would be chaotic if they did. But 
I am happy to make sure that folks are aware of your kind 
invitation and will certainly take it into consideration.
    Mr. Rose. And I invite you because, as part of my visits to 
the celebration in recent years, I have had the opportunity to 
take a look at what your staff is doing there to inspect the 
horses, and it is really quite something, the efforts, the 
lengths that are taken to make sure that these horses are 
treated humanely and fairly. And so I just think it would be 
useful to you to see that and then compare and contrast that to 
what happens elsewhere in the equine industry, the lack of 
equivalent oversight that is going on with respect to other 
shows, with respect to other breeds. So I would encourage you 
to consider coming. I think it would be insightful to you to 
have a sense for the scope of that inspection process.
    I want to shift gears. I was extremely alarmed to read the 
December 20, 2023, press release from the U.S. Attorney's 
Office for the Southern District of Mississippi announcing that 
a USDA employee named Ella Martin was sentenced to 35 months in 
prison for using her USDA position to create fraudulent 
warranty deeds with the intent to deprive the actual owners of 
the real estate of the use and benefit of their property.
    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of 
the press release entered into the record.
    The Chairman. Without objection.
    [The press release referred to is located on p. 169.]
    Mr. Rose. Mr. Secretary, what specific policies and 
procedures has USDA implemented in light of this development to 
strengthen internal controls and prevent similar fraudulent 
activity like this from occurring in the future?
    Secretary Vilsack. Every time something like this occurs, 
our Inspector General gets engaged and involved and basically 
gives us activities or steps that could be taken to ensure that 
there is not a repeat situation. We obviously are very 
interested in making sure it doesn't happen again. And so we 
institute training. We institute new guidance. We institute 
oversight to make sure that these kinds of activities don't 
occur on a regular basis.
    Mr. Rose. Mr. Secretary, recently, USDA published the 
organic livestock and poultry standards final rule that sets 
new standards for organic livestock and poultry production, 
including standards relating to animal welfare for the first 
time. Previously, the Agriculture Marketing Service stated that 
the Organic Foods Production Act (Pub. L. 101-624, Title XXI--
Organic Certification) did not, quote, ``authorize the animal 
welfare provisions,'' close quote. This sudden change in 
statutory interpretation leads me to believe this action could 
be interpreted as arbitrary and capricious. Secretary Vilsack, 
can you further explain why USDA changed their interpretation 
of this statute?
    Secretary Vilsack. I think it is important from a brand 
perspective that we do what we can to ensure that the organic 
brand remains a high-value brand. I think there is a certain 
expectation from the consuming public when they pay 
significantly more for organically produced items, that they 
are produced in an appropriate way. And I think it is a 
reflection of consumer expectation and what the industry itself 
is requesting.
    Mr. Rose. Thank you. I appreciate that insight. And I don't 
think I can make it through this question, so I think I will 
just yield back the balance of my time.
    The Chairman. The gentleman yields back. I am now pleased 
to recognize the gentlelady from Ohio, Congresswoman Brown.
    Ms. Brown. Thank you, Chairman Thompson, and thank you for 
holding this hearing today. And, Secretary Vilsack, thank you 
for being here. It is great to see you again.
    We are months past our original deadline to get the farm 
bill done and now just months away from our new deadline. As 
mentioned by my colleagues, it has been 6 months since our last 
full hearing in this Committee, and I, too, am glad that we are 
getting back to business because it is past time to get 
serious.
    So, Secretary Vilsack, as Ranking Member of the General 
Farm Commodities, Risk Management, and Credit Subcommittee, I 
appreciate the emphasis in your testimony on small- and mid-
size farming because we know that our traditional farm programs 
need to work for everyone, not just the biggest players.
    Given that the average age of the American farmer is 
increasing each year, promoting the growth of small-, mid-
sized, and urban farms is an effective way to bring new, 
younger faces into the industry. So can you talk more about 
which of the USDA's efforts for small-, mid-size, and urban 
farms are specifically targeted to or beneficial for new 
producers into the agricultural space?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, there are a couple. I mean, first 
of all, we have 17 urban center initiatives in 17 cities across 
the United States to encourage urban agriculture. We have 
placed a Farm Service Agency office in each one of those 17 
cities so that all of the programs that a farmer would have, 
wherever they are located, are available to those urban 
farmers.
    NRCS is also engaged in providing and ensuring that all the 
conservation programs, from hoop houses to extended growing 
seasons, things of that nature, are available to those urban 
systems.
    I think we are also looking at ways in which we can promote 
market opportunities. That is why we invest in Farmers' Market 
Promotion Programs. That is why we have our local agricultural 
marketing effort, which provides resources to farmers to value-
add if they produce a product. It is why we are focused on 
ensuring local food purchasing agreements. When states purchase 
product for food banks or for schools, they are doing business 
with local, small-, mid-sized producers. It is why we track 
that information. It is why we are also using our emergency 
resources, emergency funds for food assistance resources to 
funnel into that local and regional food system.
    And the reason for it is simple. When you go to the grocery 
store, the farmer gets roughly 15 of every food dollar that is 
spent. The net of that is about 7 to the farmer. But when they 
sell to a local direct-to-consumer opportunity, they can get 
50 to 75 of the food dollar. So it is a way of helping those 
small- and mid-sized operators have a market that is more 
designed for their capacities.
    So there is research that we are also investing in. There 
are systems to help those farmers transition to organic and a 
high-value proposition if they are interested in that. We also 
have a local and regional food system, a set of 12 centers 
across the country that are providing the assistance and help 
to those who want to establish a local and regional food 
system. So there are a multitude of efforts underway to help 
folks, regardless of where they are located.
    Ms. Brown. Thank you very much. I would also like to touch 
on the topic of food assistance, particularly because there are 
more than 82,000 households reliant on SNAP benefits within my 
district, representing one of the largest concentrations in the 
country. When it comes to this upcoming farm bill, there has 
been a lot of noise about the Thrifty Food Plan. Specifically, 
some Republicans have suggested we hold future reevaluations of 
the Thrifty arbitrarily cost-neutral in an effort to save 
money.
    So, Secretary Vilsack, what would the theoretical impacts 
be to holding the Thrifty to the costs of the 2021 plan for 
another 20, 30, or 40 years? And, most importantly, how would 
it impact SNAP recipients?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I believe that essentially it 
would result in us getting a benefit, as was the case in 
waiting 45 years to do what we did recently that inadequately, 
if you will, meets the requirements and the modern day needs of 
a family. I think what we found when we redid the SNAP Thrifty 
Food Plan, consistent with the 2018 Farm Bill, was that the 
information that we were funneling into the system was not 
aligned with what was actually happening in the real world. And 
that is why we used real-world data, real-world examples and 
information to better inform the system, and that is why 
Congress directed us to do that. And it resulted in a 20+ 
percent increase in the overall floor of SNAP.
    Ms. Brown. Well, thank you. It is clear in the upcoming 
farm bill two essential objectives must be met. We must strive 
to both strengthen and expand our long-standing agricultural 
programs, while simultaneously ensuring the protection of our 
nation's critical nutrition assistance. So I really hope my 
Republican colleagues are listening and will join Democrats in 
putting producers and people over politics.
    And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    The Chairman. The gentlelady yields back. I am now pleased 
to recognize the gentlelady from Texas, Congresswoman De La 
Cruz, for 5 minutes of questioning.
    Ms. De La Cruz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, 
Secretary, for being here today.
    As you know, Texas is one of three states that grows and 
mills sugarcane. And I am proud to say that in my district, 
Texas 15, which is in deep south Texas where McAllen, Texas, 
is, the sugar industry provides good jobs, and it provides 
economic opportunity and growth for our community.
    Unfortunately, it has been incredibly challenging for our 
sugar mills in our area due to the lack of water. This is in 
large part caused by the 1944 Water Treaty with Mexico (Treaty 
Series 994, Utilization of Waters of the Colorado and Tijuana 
Rivers and of the Rio Grande). Are you familiar with that water 
treaty?
    Secretary Vilsack. I am not specifically familiar with that 
specific treaty. I am familiar with water----
    Ms. De La Cruz. Well, let me share with you how important 
this treaty is. And under this treaty, Mexico is supposed to 
give United States farmers 350,000 acre-feet of water every 
year. Mexico has failed to do this. I am proud to tell you that 
I stand with my farmers and ranchers and have worked in a 
bipartisan manner to pass a House resolution that had 
overwhelming bipartisan support. And what that House resolution 
did was ask Mexico to give us our water that is so deeply, 
deeply needed. We are in the 4th year of a current 5 year cycle 
where Mexico is deficient over 760,000 acre-feet of water. This 
is simply unacceptable, and it is causing lots of harm and hurt 
to our farmers and ranchers in our area.
    Given the current water situation that is really out of our 
farmers' control, we are suffering right now deficiencies in 
water which is basically having the farmers sow less crop than 
what they are able to send. What I am asking you to do today is 
to help us in south Texas, help our farmers and ranchers 
because our sugar mill companies in south Texas are saying that 
due to this lack of water, they are going to have to close. Let 
me ask you this. How do you feel about knowing that there are 
sugar mills in south Texas that are about to close due to this 
lack of water?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I think it is important for us to 
have a focus on this issue of water, not just specifically for 
the sugar mills, but for farmers and ranchers and producers 
across the United States, and particularly in the western part 
of the U.S. It is one of the reasons why we established our 
Western Water Initiative, which I probably should make sure 
your staff is aware of, if they aren't already, which is really 
focused on sustaining agricultural productivity, taking a look 
at ways in which we can protect both surface water and 
groundwater, restoring range lands and forest lands in terms of 
water utilization, and responding to disruptions.
    Ms. De La Cruz. Let me reclaim my time----
    Secretary Vilsack. Sure.
    Ms. De La Cruz.--Mr. Secretary, because it is such an 
important issue. And like my colleague across the aisle said, 
we don't want to play partisan politics with our farmers and 
ranchers. Food security is national security, and I would like 
your commitment to stand with me and our farmers and ranchers 
and meet with and talk with Secretary Blinken about Mexico's 
lack of abiding to the 1944 treaty. Can I have your commitment 
to stand with the ranchers and farmers and speak to Secretary 
Blinken about this treaty?
    Secretary Vilsack. I am happy to take a look and learn more 
about this and get back to you, Congresswoman. I think that is 
fair.
    Ms. De La Cruz. Thank you. I greatly, greatly appreciate 
it, and my office will follow up with you on this important 
topic.
    With that, I yield back.
    The Chairman. The gentlelady yields back.
    I am now pleased to recognize the gentlelady from Hawaii, 
Congresswoman Tokuda, for 5 minutes of questioning.
    Ms. Tokuda. Mahalo, Mr. Chairman. And, first of all, 
Secretary Vilsack, just a big thank you to the USDA for all the 
responses that have come forth as a result of the wildfires in 
Lahaina. I know you have not been able to come and visit yet, 
but please, we welcome you to do so. We had significant damage, 
over 6,300 acres burned and razed as a result of the fire. We 
lost heads of cattle, equipment: $23 million in damage may not 
seem like a lot in some communities, but it is very big for 
ours. So again, thank you, but we do know that there is a lot 
of work that needs to be done, a lot more funding for 
disasters. After Lahaina, we have seen so much more, and so we 
need to start funding these efforts so that you and your teams 
can do good work in the community.
    The hard part about going almost last is a lot of questions 
have been asked already, so I will try to jump to some 
different ones that have not been touched on yet. I wanted to 
talk a little bit about our need to continue our ongoing 
commitment to the 1890 and 1994 land-grant universities. As you 
know, I remain committed and concerned about access to 
scholarships and resources for Asian American, Native Hawaiian, 
and Pacific Islander students. And I know we have discussed 
this, Mr. Secretary, before when you spoke to our Congressional 
Asian Pacific American Caucus. However, I reiterate the need 
for Congressman Sablan's AANAPISI Opportunity Act (H.R. 2783) 
of which I am an original cosponsor. And so what is your 
position on establishing grants to support Asian American and 
Pacific Islander-centered agricultural research and 
scholarships for AANHPI students? And what steps has the 
Department taken to support AANHPI farmers as well?
    Secretary Vilsack. We have included those students in our 
NextGen Initiative, which is designed to provide resources to 
minority-serving institutions across the board, to fund 
scholarships, internships, fellowships, and things of that 
nature. That is $262 million from the American Rescue Plan that 
has been circulated or provided in a series of grants. We have 
also made sure that our Office of Partnership, basically, as it 
administers the Scholars Program, ensures that it is 
administered in a holistic way. And I think you will see that 
there are actually more grants and more scholarships that have 
been awarded recently.
    Ms. Tokuda. Thank you for that. And I would just reiterate 
as well--and we have spoken about this before that as we do 
outreach to these particular communities, we need to be 
conscious about the best way and most effective way to reach 
out to them, oftentimes, too, considering language, access, and 
barriers that may be particular issues, cultural barriers as 
well. And so to the extent that that can be aggressively 
integrated into your outreach so we can make sure that those 
individuals, those students have access, are able to 
participate actively, I would appreciate that.
    Secretary Vilsack. We have a very extensive process now 
where we are trying to convert a lot of our information into 
multiple languages to make sure that information is more 
readily available to a broader scope of individuals.
    Ms. Tokuda. Thank you. And somewhat along those lines, when 
I take a look at and we talk about indigenous agriculture--by 
the way, if you are able to join us in Hawaii, we can really 
expose you to some of the uniqueness of Native Hawaiian and 
Pacific Islander traditional farming practices and techniques, 
crops that for us might be--they are staple crops for us, 
specialty crops to others. But on this particular issue, I 
often see in my home state and in my district how challenging 
it can be for my producers, including Native Hawaiian 
producers, to access USDA programs in the first place.
    Mr. Secretary, underrepresented and underserved producers 
have been calling on the Department to pilot a navigator 
program to help them navigate USDA's systems and processes for 
some time now. What is your position on the need for and the 
effectiveness of such a pilot program to be able to connect up 
our farmers, ranchers, and producers with the support and help 
that is available that they need but is right now very 
inaccessible to them in the way it is being offered?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, both the Farm Service Agency 
office and the NRCS have engaged in the signing of a series of 
cooperative agreements similar to what you have outlined. Farm 
Service has over 30 of these agreements. NRCS has over 100 of 
them with organizations and entities designed to provide 
outreach to historically underserved producers to make sure 
that they are aware of programs and to help guide them through 
whatever the application process needs to be. So that is 
already taking place in both of those agencies.
    Ms. Tokuda. I would humbly suggest and I am glad to see 
that these cooperative agreements are in place. But for many of 
us that represent communities with high populations, for 
example, I am specifically talking about AANHPI communities--
let's just make sure that the individuals we are actually 
contracting with, that the method in which we are outreaching 
to them through these individual groups are the most effective 
possible. So I welcome further communication with you on this 
because at the end of the day, I want to make sure my farmers, 
ranchers, and producers can actually engage with the USDA in a 
meaningful way.
    I have a number of other questions relating to natural 
disasters and rural health, I know, Mr. Chairman, an interest 
you and I both share in terms of making sure that food is 
viewed as medicine and we can help our rural communities, so we 
will submit that for the record. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. I thank the gentlelady. I am now pleased to 
recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. Duarte, for 5 
minutes of questioning.
    Mr. Duarte. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, a big thank you. Thank 
you to the Secretary. [inaudible]. I had just a month ago best-
of-breed growers in my district with very established farm 
families, almond, walnut, winegrape growers, diversified, long-
term families call me into a meeting with bankers talking about 
a farm liquidity crisis, a farm borrowing crisis in the Central 
Valley. Almond prices have been low for a long time. 
Pistachios, walnuts are through the floor. Winegrapes are 
entire glut right now greatly due to a lack of exports.
    But nonetheless, anything you can do, Mr. Secretary, with 
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to loosen the screws a 
little bit on ag lending is going to be very, very important. 
Anything you can do with the Farm Credits to make sure that ag 
lenders can get their growers through this crisis because if 
you look at the aggregate numbers, American farm values and ag 
revenues are down tens of billions of dollars in the last 
couple of years. In specialty crops in California a lot of 
these high export crops, it is disproportional pain. And so 
please look at ag lending. Look at farm liquidity. It is a 
crisis.
    The crisis stems greatly from trade deals, from trade, and 
not necessarily lack of trade deals. Yes, there is a lot we can 
do there. But the retaliatory agricultural tariffs from China, 
India, and Turkey--those are the big pieces of the pie chart--
are really what is causing, in my opinion, the agricultural 
crisis today, the commodity gluts, the low prices, and the low 
farm returns.
    I am carrying a bill, but I believe you have it within your 
power to look at the Commodity Credit Corporation. My bill is 
called Foreign Retaliatory Agricultural Tariffs Supplement. 
Simply use the Commodity Credit Corporation fees instead of 
some of the other programs that are elevating farmers under low 
prices to simply supplement back the retaliatory ag tariffs 
being put on farm exports. If we export almonds, it is a 25 
percent tariff to China. Supplement that back to the exporter, 
get it down to the grower, and that would alleviate the gluts 
that are killing farm returns right now today.
    And so I would very much like to connect with you or 
anybody in your trade group on an F-RATS proposal. We just won 
a 5 year World Trade Organization lawsuit against China's 
retaliatory ag tariffs, and those ag tariffs are still in 
place, and they are really crushing American agriculture, so I 
would invite you to look at that.
    I also want to look at--I have worked in some plant 
biotechnology over the years. Gene editing is a brave new 
frontier in plant biotech and plant improvement and solving a 
lot of the long-term sustainability problems and challenges 
that we have in growing crops, especially clonal crops like 
grapes and almonds where it is not easy to breed new seed each 
year.
    There are people--you have Under Secretary for Market 
Services, Jenny Moffitt, in your group, who I am getting a lot 
of feedback on, is really restricting the types of CRISPR 
editing that can be done in plants and still qualify for the 
biopesticide exclusions. It is really not the realm of USDA to 
be delving into these pesticide exclusions. That is really an 
EPA area. But I would invite you to take a look at that and 
make sure that America maintains its leadership in plant 
biotechnology, especially in the CRISPR gene editing area. It 
is incredibly important. I think 37 Nobel laureates just signed 
a joint letter encouraging the EU to maintain leadership in 
this field. I would hate to see America give up our leadership 
in biotechnology, which we have established over many years.
    And fourth--I am not letting you talk much today, but you 
have had a lot of that. At least I am not breaking your chops 
too hard. The fourth thing I would want to talk about is the 
crop insurance and using the example of the citrus producers in 
California as a case. We got the Oriental and the Queensland 
fruit flies that infest California citrus, causing huge 
marketing problems with their crop, huge movement problems 
within our fresh crop and citrus. And I really want to make 
sure that our crop insurance programs allow for marketability 
losses due to exotic pest infestations and disease 
infestations, as well as catastrophic weather events and other 
losses. These things cost farmers the same loss of returns and 
revenue as catastrophic weather events, and they are often 
almost all the time out of the control of the farmers 
themselves.
    Thank you for listening. I am sure you will have something 
to say for the next person. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Thank 
you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
    The Chairman. The gentleman yields back. Now I am pleased 
to recognize the gentlelady from Minnesota, Congresswoman 
Craig, wishing her a very happy birthday to begin with and----
    Ms. Craig. What a way to spend a birthday. This is 
fantastic.
    The Chairman. There you go.
    Ms. Craig. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for making my 
birthday----
    The Chairman.--is recognized for 5 minutes of questioning.
    Ms. Craig. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you 
for being here, Secretary Vilsack. It is a great honor to be 
here with you on my birthday.
    So from your own visit to Minnesota 2 weeks ago to Deputy 
Secretary Torres Small's visit in 2021, I know that you and 
your team at USDA have been great partners in working to 
support family farmers and rural economies in Minnesota and 
across the country, so thank you for that partnership. I know 
you have put some miles on yourself over the last 3 years, and 
we appreciate your dedication to family farmers.
    I have a few questions. I won't let you get off as easy as 
my colleague there, so I am going to get right to it.
    First of all, we have a unique opportunity in front of us 
to get sustainable aviation fuel off the ground and in places 
like my district in rural America into this emerging market 
that we fought for in the Inflation Reduction Act. I know you 
are enthusiastic, and I want to thank you so much for your 
support of renewable fuels over the years and for your 
championship of SAF. It does not go unnoticed by my family 
farmers and by myself.
    However, it is frustrating to hear that there is still some 
uncertainty about the updated GREET model. I know the President 
has a goal of hitting 35 billion gallons of SAF by 2050, which 
is laudable, yet we are still waiting on a determination from 
the interagency working group on GREET modeling. So let me just 
push you here. How have the discussions been in that 
interagency working group to update the model? And can we 
expect those updates to be announced on March 1, as originally 
directed in the December guidance from Treasury? And if not, 
when should we expect them?
    Secretary Vilsack. Conversations have been positive in 
terms of expanded access to feedstocks to produce SAF, and I am 
confident that there is a genuine desire on the part of all the 
agencies and the White House to meet that March 1 deadline.
    Ms. Craig. Excellent. That is a great answer. Thank you.
    I know that you will see this soon, but I am leading a 
bipartisan, bicameral letter with 25 of my colleagues on the 
issue. It will be sent to members of the working group at the 
end of the day today. And please know that there are American 
farmers that have been unable to scale up their production 
because they are waiting on this guidance, and we certainly are 
looking forward to it and hopefully by that March 1 timeline.
    My second question is about the grassland Conservation 
Reserve Program, CRP. We know it is an absolute critical 
program that supports farmers and the work that they do to 
sustain the lands that they farm. And thank you for your 
remarks in your opening statement there.
    My home State of Minnesota is eighth in the country for the 
number of acres enrolled and third in annual rental payments 
for the program. So I know there is an ongoing conversation 
about turning CRP into a dollar-based program. Given the rising 
costs of land, how do you foresee this impacting CRP's 
effectiveness if that happened?
    Secretary Vilsack. What is interesting about the grasslands 
part of the CRP program is we are now at a record level of 
enrollment. There is a lot of activity and a lot of interest in 
the grassland, and we have continually seen that each year in 
terms of the signup. There is still robust interest in CRP, and 
I would anticipate and expect that it is going to continue.
    I think there will be an interesting intersection of 
climate-smart activities and ecosystem service markets and the 
potential opportunities for CRP to be integrated into that 
system. But I think, right now, we are excited about the 
opportunities, and we continue to see a lot of interest in it. 
And, we are sensitive to making sure that the rental rates are 
in a situation where they don't necessarily encourage or 
discourage the use of productive farmland for productivity and 
nonproductive land for going into CRP.
    Ms. Craig. I think I have just enough time to sneak in one 
more question. I know the farm bill is on top of everybody's 
mind--it is certainly on mine as well--and that American ag is 
at a crossroads. It is just essential that we continue to 
improve the farm safety net. What should legislators be keeping 
in mind as we look to strengthen the farm safety net in the 
farm bill from your perspective, Secretary Vilsack?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I think the challenge is to find 
the resources to strengthen the safety net without necessarily 
jeopardizing the capacity of nutrition assistance to do what it 
needs to do and without taking resources away from 
conservation, which benefits a broad array of producers. I 
think that is the challenge, and I think there is a creative 
way to do that that doesn't necessarily limit SNAP and doesn't 
necessarily take money from the IRA. I think that is the key.
    Ms. Craig. I couldn't agree with you more. And with that, 
Mr. Secretary, thank you. And I yield back.
    Secretary Vilsack. Happy birthday.
    Ms. Craig. Thank you.
    The Chairman. I thank the gentlelady for sharing her 
birthday with us today. And I am pleased to recognize the 
gentleman from Iowa, Representative Nunn, for 5 minutes of 
questioning.
    Mr. Nunn. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank 
you, Secretary of Agriculture, for being with us today.
    Unfortunately, we are talking to farmers who are facing 
larger-than-expected year-to-year losses, in fact, a drop in 
net income in 2024 alone. This is one of the largest drops of 
nearly $40 billion that everyday farmers across the country are 
facing. In fact, it is down 25 percent just from last year.
    So let's get directly to it. Look, the reality is that 
taxpayers have invested over $500 million in the expansion of 
biofuels. And I appreciate my colleague on the other side of 
the aisle, Congresswoman Craig. We have worked together on this 
issue. But at the same time, taxpayers under this 
Administration have also put $40 billion into electric vehicle 
infrastructures through the Inflation Reduction Act.
    So let's begin here. Our home State of Iowa, biofuels 
produced in our home state provide Americans with cheaper and 
cleaner fuel. Mr. Secretary, we could both agree to that. Is 
that right?
    Secretary Vilsack. Yes.
    Mr. Nunn. Is it true that biofuels reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions and have a lower carbon footprint when compared with 
traditional fuels?
    Secretary Vilsack. Yes.
    Mr. Nunn. Do you believe that America's energy independence 
is a priority for national security?
    Secretary Vilsack. Sure.
    Mr. Nunn. So here we are in a situation where we are now 
putting $40 billion directly into a competition of an electric 
vehicle system that directly funds one of our key competitors, 
that of China. Are you aware of the fact that China uses child 
slave labor for the production and elicitation of a number of 
the critical minerals necessary to build batteries?
    Secretary Vilsack. That is why we are focused on investing 
in battery production here in the U.S.
    Mr. Nunn. But we haven't done that yet.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, we are doing it.
    Mr. Nunn. So here, Mr. Secretary, I would like to talk 
about where some of our additional competition comes from, and 
that is in our export markets. When we talk about foreign 
competitors, let's talk about Brazil. Last year, the U.S. 
exported 1,600 million bushels of corn. Additionally, the U.S. 
exported 1.25 billion gallons of ethanol to that same market. 
But, Mr. Secretary, is it not also true that Brazil has 
increased their tariffs on U.S. ethanol 18 percent last year?
    Secretary Vilsack. That is true.
    Mr. Nunn. And, as a result, the United States is now 
importing nearly 40 million bushels?
    Secretary Vilsack. I don't know what the exact number is, 
but I am sure you do.
    Mr. Nunn. It certainly makes it harder for Iowa farmers 
when we are competing in a tariff environment, I would ask the 
Administration to look into this and be able to push back on 
our competitors, not just Brazil, but around the world.
    Secretary Vilsack. And we do. We do.
    Mr. Nunn. Mr. Secretary, you also agree that a lack of 
access to global markets is harming the U.S. biofuel industry?
    Secretary Vilsack. No, I don't agree with that because we 
have actually----
    Mr. Nunn. So us not being able to sell to foreign countries 
is not harming U.S. farmers?
    Secretary Vilsack. We actually are seeing an increase in 
activity on the export side of biofuels. We have seen in Japan, 
Japan recently----
    Mr. Nunn. Not nearly enough to make up for what we are 
losing in markets like Brazil, like Africa----
    Secretary Vilsack. Your question suggested that we weren't 
doing any of that, and that is just not accurate.
    Mr. Nunn. Mr. Secretary, there are 87,000 farmers in our 
home state. The average farmer is 57. In fact, most of those 
farmers are approaching an age where they are going to be over 
70 years old. We don't expect any other industry to have to not 
only have a 25 percent loss in revenue over last year without 
providing some onramps and some incentives from our own Federal 
Government.
    So here is what I would like to ask of us. Please join with 
this Committee, as we have done in the farm bill, to provide 
onramps for new farmers, nontraditional farmers, veteran 
farmers. These are things that not only help grow Iowa's 
economy, but help keep us competitive around the world.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well----
    Mr. Nunn. And I will also say that some of the conservation 
practices that are coming out of Iowa are a model not only for 
the U.S., but are ones that the USDA could learn from. And 
right now, working with USDA, while I appreciate the individual 
groups, is a top-down-only approach. And I see some folks in 
the audience today with ``Pass Goldie's Act.'' USDA has 
consistently fallen short in enforcing puppy mills in Iowa, now 
ranked as one of the worst in the country. In fact, our local 
law enforcement have asked USDA for support, and time and time 
again, they have made it difficult. That is part of what is in 
this farm bill.
    So, Mr. Secretary, as we work together on a farm bill, I 
hope that your agency and this Committee continues to listen to 
Iowa farmers who are leading the charge on this, not just in 
biofuels, but in our best practices across the board. And so, 
Mr. Secretary, I will end where we started here. When it comes 
to what this Administration has committed to and you have done, 
is this effort for year-round E15 that you committed to this 
Committee last year going to be ready in 2024?
    Secretary Vilsack. I think we are going to have E15 year-
round. I don't know what year. I don't know if it is 2024 or 
2025. If it is 2025, I am reasonably confident that we will see 
access to E15----
    Mr. Nunn. I appreciate that----
    Secretary Vilsack. Let me finish.
    Mr. Nunn.--Mr. Secretary, but the reality has been----
    Secretary Vilsack. Let me finish. Let me finish, 
Congressman.
    Mr. Nunn.--that you consistently----
    Secretary Vilsack. Let me finish.
    Mr. Nunn.--promise this and here we are----
    Secretary Vilsack. No, no----
    Mr. Nunn.--years in the making?
    Secretary Vilsack. No----
    Mr. Nunn. No, I have 8 seconds left, and I just want to 
highlight this, Mr. Secretary. It is important that not only do 
we work together, but we follow through on our commitments that 
we make to Iowa farmers.
    Secretary Vilsack. We are following through.
    Mr. Nunn. With that, Mr. Chairman----
    Secretary Vilsack. It is not----
    Mr. Nunn.--I yield back.
    Secretary Vilsack. It is not fair to mischaracterize what 
we are doing here, Congressman. That is just not fair. That is 
not Iowa.
    Mr. Nunn. Mr. Secretary----
    Secretary Vilsack. I will tell you what, that is not----
    Mr. Nunn.--2024----
    Secretary Vilsack.--what we do in Iowa.
    Mr. Nunn.--you made that commitment that we would be able 
to be E15 year-round. Is that correct?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, we are going to----
    The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired.
    Secretary Vilsack.--be E15 year-round. We are.
    Mr. Nunn. You just told me 2025 or sometime in the future.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, we will be E15. And I will tell 
you, we are the best Administration for ethanol in the history 
of this country, and I can guarantee you----
    Mr. Nunn. That is only because of Iowa farmers and others 
who have led the charge on this.
    Secretary Vilsack. [inaudible]----
    Mr. Nunn. And I am glad you are responsive to them, but 
that is a huge part. Let's give----
    The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired.
    Mr. Nunn.--credit to the farmers on this. Thank you.
    The Chairman. I will recognize the gentlelady from 
Connecticut, Congresswoman Hayes, for 5 minutes.
    Mrs. Hayes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Got it nice and chilly 
in here for you, Secretary Vilsack, so you guys had to heat it 
up. Thanks for being here again to talk to us. It is no 
surprise. You already know what I am going to ask about. But 
before I begin my questions, I just want to make note of the 
fact that we saw a chart earlier from the Republicans that 
showed that their class neutrality plan would not cut SNAP 
benefits. I think it is pretty basic math to say that, as more 
people are accessing these programs and it is growing, if we 
are not continuing to invest in them, that is in essence 
cutting SNAP benefits. You can call it whatever you want.
    But we pulled data from the CBO's May baseline that refutes 
that account, so I have another chart that I would like to 
introduce into the record to show that if we keep the Thrifty 
Food Plan cost-neutral--this is the Republicans' plan; this is 
the Democrats' plan--benefits will be decreased. I would like 
to enter that into the record, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Without objection.
    [The information referred to is located on p. 170.]
    Mrs. Hayes. Thank you. Secretary Vilsack, as you know, SNAP 
is the leading anti-hunger program in the nation. And according 
to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the program 
reduces food insecurity by 30 percent. I have heard several 
times in this hearing that food is national security, so I 
would hope that we would be trying to feed more people, not 
less here in America.
    And to do that, we have heard a lot about the data and how 
it is collected. SNAP administrators provide application 
assistance, answer client questions, and offer verification 
guidance for SNAP applicants. Throughout the pandemic, as you 
mentioned earlier, there was lots of flexibility, and SNAP 
administrators were stretched beyond capacity as they worked to 
ensure families were fed.
    Now, as we are looking at how do we improve these programs, 
as of April 2023, states and towns struggled to fill over 
833,000 open positions for the employees who actually do this 
work.\3\ I have concerns about that because I don't want us to 
look at the program as ineffective or inefficient because of 
staffing or administrative concerns.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ Editor's note: Mrs. Hayes submitted a clarification to her 
statement (supplementary information), it is located on p. 170.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    So, Secretary Vilsack, what have you heard from state 
agencies about obstacles to recruiting and retaining SNAP 
administrators?
    Secretary Vilsack. I think most of the agencies have asked 
for some kind of relaxation. And the concern is, we are 
providing $5.7 billion to states across the country to 
administer these programs. And I think it is important and 
necessary for them to do what they need to do, to be able to 
recruit the staff necessary to administer these programs 
properly without necessarily cutting corners because when you 
cut corners, it risks the integrity of the program. So we are 
encouraging folks to get back to normal business. We appreciate 
the importance of flexibility, but I think there is a balance 
between flexibility and making sure that the resources we are 
providing them are being used adequately and appropriately to 
staff these programs.
    Mrs. Hayes. I couldn't agree more. Last week, I introduced 
the SNAP Administrators Retention Act (H.R. 7285), which would 
allow states to receive 100 percent of the costs associated 
with hiring and retaining staff to run these programs. 
Additionally, it aligns the wages of the state SNAP 
administrators with Federal wages. These are commonsense 
solutions to improve access to SNAP, prevent backlogs, and feed 
real people.
    Secretary Vilsack, on February 8, the USDA sent letters to 
states, including my State of Connecticut, expressing concern 
about the decline in several key benchmarks of state 
administration of SNAP. I heard you say earlier, people don't 
know about the benefits, they don't have access to them, they 
are not really sure how to go about getting them. Can you 
please elaborate on how the Food and Nutrition Service plans to 
collaborate with states to improve program efficiency?
    Secretary Vilsack. We continue to provide technical 
assistance to states as they grapple with particular issues. We 
also have the Employment and Training Program, the SNAP-
Education Program. There are a variety of ways in which we are 
providing assistance to states in the administration of this 
program. The challenge, I think, is that some states basically 
don't--they are not as aggressive as they need to be to make 
sure that people who qualify for the program actually sign up 
for the program. So we basically keep track, and if we see 
somebody that is below par, we basically encourage them to step 
up their activities. Sometimes it is with seniors, sometimes it 
is language issues, sometimes it is just making sure that the 
word gets out and you don't create too many barriers to 
participation.
    Mrs. Hayes. Well, thank you for that. And like you, I agree 
that the government does work. We can make it work. I can tell 
you when a storm hits and FEMA comes, people are happy to see 
the government. I have a piece of legislation closing the 
college hunger gap, which does exactly that. When students 
apply for FAFSA, they would know if they were eligible for a 
program like SNAP. And we are all--it is one government. We 
have the ability to communicate across agencies, and I think we 
could do a better job of doing that.
    Thank you so much for your time today. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield back.
    The Chairman. The gentlelady's time has expired. I am now 
pleased to recognize the gentleman from Indiana, Mr. Baird, for 
5 minutes of questioning.
    Mr. Baird. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, 
Secretary Vilsack, for being here today. My first question 
deals with getting some idea where you think you are in 
drafting the implementation of the SUSTAINS Act (Pub. L. 117-
328, Division HH--Agriculture). That is a public-private 
partnership program. That will bring private dollars into the 
conservation program. So where do you think we are on that 
issue?
    Secretary Vilsack. I have had a number of conversations 
with individuals in the investment bank world that would 
potentially be interested in promoting additional conservation 
investments. And we are providing opportunities for them to 
understand the various programs. I think there is some interest 
in this, and I think it is also reflected in participation in 
the Climate-Smart Commodity Partnership Initiative. We have a 
broad array of food interest, retail interest, nonprofit 
interest, as well as foundation interest in that program.
    Mr. Baird. Excuse me. And continuing on in that vein, so to 
speak, the IRA conservation funding is limited to practices 
that are climate-smart, which we have mentioned earlier, as 
defined by USDA staff. And that makes roughly 30 to 70 percent 
of the conservation practices ineligible in some states for IRA 
conservation funding. And from my vantage point, this removes 
the locally-led producer-first nature of these programs and 
allows USDA staff in Washington, D.C., to choose which natural 
resource concerns can be addressed in Indiana or elsewhere.
    So, Mr. Vilsack, since IRA funding is limited to climate-
smart practices, how can you ensure that the locally-led nature 
of conservation programs won't be lost? And how important is 
the locally-led component of conservation programs?
    Secretary Vilsack. I don't think they are being lost, 
Congressman. I think we are seeing tremendous interest and 
participation by farmers and ranchers and producers across the 
board. That is why these programs have all been oversubscribed. 
We literally have thousands of applications for the resources 
that are available above and beyond the resources that are 
available, so there is tremendous interest in this. So I don't 
think we are leaving anybody behind in this process. And I 
think people at the local level are fully engaged. Additional 
resources are going into personnel and cooperative agreements 
to get the word out. We are very pleased with the way in which 
the countryside has responded to this.
    Mr. Baird. I think that is an important issue, the fact 
that the locals participate and have input into the kind of 
programs they are interested in. And I think we need to make 
sure we carry that on through and follow up on that kind of 
activity, so thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. The gentleman yields back. I am now pleased 
to recognize the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Davis, for 
5 minutes of questioning.
    Mr. Davis of North Carolina. Thank you so much, Mr. 
Chairman. And good afternoon, Mr. Secretary. Thank you so much 
for coming before the House Agriculture Committee today.
    I would like to first amplify that in rural North Carolina 
and rural America we continue to rely greatly on Rural 
Development, in particular, new fire trucks, getting those out 
into communities that often rely heavily on volunteer 
departments. Telehealth services, that is huge for our rural 
communities. I am also looking at ways to continue to help with 
economic support to small businesses. So I just want to 
continue to lift that up.
    Where I would like to spend a little bit more time today is 
in particular looking and talking about broadband. Broadband, 
in terms of the long-term success of eastern North Carolina, 
much of rural America depends on access, making affordable 
access. My question is can you provide insight into the 
challenges that remain in bridging the digital divide and 
especially, as we are talking, getting this out into rural 
communities?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I think the challenge is making 
sure that, first and foremost, the states do the job of 
utilizing the resources that are now being made available to 
them under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to expand access 
to broadband in areas that currently are underserved or 
unserved.
    Second, I think it is important for us to make sure that, 
as we are expanding access, that we are doing it in a way that 
has meaningful broadband access, that it provides the kinds of 
upload and download speeds that will allow a family, for 
example, to have the ability to have somebody download--more 
than one person at a time.
    I think it is important as well that we continue to fund--
and you mentioned telemedicine--distance learning, that we 
continue to fund the tools that will allow institutions to 
utilize this expanded access to broadband in a way that then 
expands educational opportunities or healthcare opportunities 
in small and remote areas.
    And then finally, I think we are going to continue to look 
at the technology necessary to make sure that it gets to the 
most remote of areas. Sometimes it is not physically or 
financially feasible to have particular technologies. And then 
there is a workforce issue and making sure that we have 
adequate number of people who are qualified to install and to 
maintain these systems. So it is a combination of all that.
    Mr. Davis of North Carolina. And, Mr. Secretary, as a 
follow-up here, do you have any sense of a time in which we 
will see significant coverage across rural America?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I can tell you that, based on the 
recent survey that we concluded and published yesterday, we 
have seen an increase in access among American farms and 
ranches. About 78 percent of farms and ranches report basically 
access to broadband, and that is up from 75 percent. I think 
you are going to see rather dramatic increases over the course 
of the next 3 to 5 years as the resources that have been made 
available under the infrastructure law are fully obligated and 
ultimately result in the construction and implementation. I 
mean, you are seeing it now with our ReConnect program. We have 
basically gotten resources out the door. There are over 100 
projects that we have announced awards for that are moving 
forward. You are going to see progress on those. And I think 
you are going to see states aggressively use the resource that 
is now available to them under the Commerce Department and the 
FCC's efforts.
    Mr. Davis of North Carolina. Mr. Secretary, I have another 
question. The issue of hunger, in particular in the military, 
it has been receiving a lot of attention lately in the recent 
months thanks to the tireless work of advocates and 
organizations on the ground. When I look at the 2022 National 
Defense Authorization Act (Pub. L. 117-81), it included a new 
basic needs allowance for lower-income service members, which 
will help to address the issue. It is reaching fewer service 
members than we would hope, but, my question to you, are there 
any steps in particular that USDA or Congress you believe 
should take in order to address food insecurity, in particular 
with our military families?
    Secretary Vilsack. We have an ongoing effort with the 
Department of Defense to institute this program and to make 
sure that families are aware of the capacity to qualify for 
these programs. I would like the opportunity, Congressman, to 
get back to you with what recommendations the folks who have 
been working directly with the Department of Defense have about 
any improvements to the effort. Obviously, we are deeply 
concerned about making sure that those who serve us, that they 
can fully utilize the programs that we have, so let me get back 
to you.
    Mr. Davis of North Carolina. Thank you, and I yield back, 
Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired. I am now 
pleased to recognize the gentleman from New York, Mr. 
Langworthy, for 5 minutes of questioning.
    Mr. Langworthy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Vilsack, 
I appreciate you being here once again as we continue to craft 
an effective farm bill that supports our family farmers and 
reduces the regulatory burdens of this Administration.
    But before I get into that, I want to bring your attention 
to an issue that is still impacting my district in rural 
upstate New York. As you may recall, just about a year and a 
half ago in December of 2022, Winter Storm Elliott ravaged my 
district in western New York and across the southern tier. And 
this was a once-in-a-generation storm that brought 
unprecedented blizzard-like conditions and subzero temperatures 
to the western New York community. Winter Storm Elliott also 
wreaked havoc on the dairy industry, resulting in the closure 
of dairy plants and extensive dumping of milk. Farmers in my 
district faced the grim reality of being unable to have their 
milk collected and delivered, compounding an already dire 
situation.
    I do recall that USDA set up a Milk Loss Program, and I 
appreciate the efforts that the Department has made with the 
rollout of milk loss payments to producers in my district. 
However, I understand there is also a pending component of the 
program to reimburse cooperative loss. And, as you know, dairy 
cooperatives play a vital role in strengthening and supporting 
the well-being of family farm operations in my district and 
nationwide.
    And with that, Mr. Secretary, I was wondering if you had an 
update or a timeline that you can share today on when those 
cooperative losses will be made available and if the Department 
has made any progress on that? I am interested in anything this 
Committee can do to support you in this effort and help move 
this along.
    Secretary Vilsack. Let me get a specific answer to that 
question. Congressman, as I sit here today, I don't know 
specifically about the status of that. I thought you were going 
to ask me about the Dairy Margin Coverage Program, and I have a 
response to that question, but not to this one.
    Mr. Langworthy. Well, I mean, our farmers have been without 
payment for almost a year and a half now, and this is 
ridiculous. It is concerning to me that we have had no 
reimbursement for cooperative losses that have been made at 
all. And equally troubling is the lack of communication to 
producers in my district regarding a timeline or updates prior 
to today's hearing. So it is really important that we get this 
information to share with our constituents. And it is important 
to me that our farmers feel that they have been communicated 
with, and they have been left in the dark at this point by the 
Department.
    Our agricultural producers, they are already struggling 
with this Administration's egregious green agenda and the 
regulatory policies that are causing our energy prices to 
skyrocket, and it has put farmers' backs against the wall. And 
this can also run them right out of business. So, all I ask you 
to do today is to expeditiously use all the tools that the 
Department has to get an answer and get these payments moved 
forward. And I think that is a very important step for the 
farmers in my district.
    Now, moving on to a different topic, Mr. Secretary, last 
year, Dr. George Koob, the Director of National Institute of 
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, suggested in an interview that 
the next version of our Dietary Guidelines for Americans might 
change the definition of moderate alcohol consumption to just 
two alcoholic drinks per week for men and women. Now, that 
would be a dramatic change from the current definition of up to 
two drinks per day for each man and woman, which is included in 
the DGA's release of December 2020. Does the USDA share Dr. 
Koob's suggestion that drinking more than two beers a day is 
excessive? And if so, can the USDA point to any new scientific 
studies released since December 2020 that would justify such a 
dramatic change in that definition of moderate consumption?
    Secretary Vilsack. Frankly, our focus on the Dietary 
Guidelines is on the dietary guidelines and not things that are 
necessarily outside are being considered outside of the Dietary 
Guidelines. We want to make sure that it is science-based. 
Whatever is decided needs to be science-based, and that is why 
you set up a system with experts. You give experts the 
information. They make decisions based on the preponderance of 
the evidence. We want to make sure that that system is 
followed, whether it is alcohol or any other aspect of our 
diets. We want to make sure it is science-based. That is what I 
am committed to doing.
    Mr. Langworthy. Okay. Mr. Secretary, well, I understand 
this process is developing the 2025 Dietary Guidelines. That is 
well underway right now. I just ask that any recommendations 
based on sound science and not the usual regulatory overreach 
that we have seen by this Administration?
    And my additional question I am not going to have enough 
time for, I am going to submit to you in writing. And, Mr. 
Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Miller of Ohio [presiding.] The gentleman yields back. 
The gentlelady from Kansas, Ms. Davids, is now recognized for 5 
minutes of questions.
    Ms. Davids of Kansas. Thank you. And thank you, Secretary 
Vilsack, for being here today. I am very proud and happy to get 
the chance to serve as the Representative for the Kansas 3rd 
District. And my district is comprised of rural, urban, 
suburban, exurban. It is a pretty diverse district. And I do 
think we serve as an excellent example of the critical role 
that USDA plays, frankly, in every community across the 
country. Kansas farmers and producers in my view are some of 
the best in the world and would love actually to extend an 
invitation for you to come and visit us to see some of the 
innovative and certainly important work that they are doing out 
there.
    In addition to my role on the Agriculture Committee, I also 
serve on the Small Business Committee and Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee. And through those roles, I really 
have had the chance to work on supply chain issues from quite a 
few different angles. Strengthening the agriculture supply 
chain is important for all Americans, particularly for our 
farmers and producers as they are providing food for folks.
    And I know that the USDA is doing a lot of work on this. 
There are tons of USDA employees who have taken steps to 
strengthen our agriculture supply chains as we recover from 
some of the recent challenges we have been seeing. And I am 
particularly grateful for some of the USDA food inspectors and 
the folks who are taking the time to make sure that meat and 
poultry processing are happening in a safe and effective way.
    So I want to say that the progress that we have seen, which 
is a testament to the hard work of producers, processors, 
truckers, the intermodal workers, so many different people, we 
haven't seen the grocery costs that folks are dealing with come 
down for consumers in the way that, frankly, a lot of people 
need and would depend on. It remains a top concern for a lot of 
folks in my district, high grocery costs.
    And I did get the chance to discuss this with Deputy 
Secretary Torres Small this past fall and would love to hear 
from you about some of the specific actions that USDA has been 
taking to increase the resilience of the agriculture supply 
chains to help bring down those costs for folks.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, let me give one example, an 
initiative that we are working with the Department of 
Transportation to make sure that we are doing a good job of 
understanding the flow and deciding or identifying where there 
may be barriers in the supply chain and the flow of goods from 
here to there that create additional cost or additional 
disruptions that can result in supply shortages, which in turn 
result in increased cost. We have an initiative with the 
Department of Transportation to basically share data and 
information and analyze that information so that we can 
identify problems.
    We also have an effort with the Department of 
Transportation to take a look at the supply of containers so 
that we know where there may be potential problems with 
container supply that we can in turn make sure that adequate 
containers are available to basically move product. That is one 
area. And then there is also the area--sometimes we forget the 
role that a particular disease or problem might result in terms 
of food costs. I am thinking about HPAI, the avian influenza, 
and the impact and effect it has on eggs. When there is an 
outbreak, when there is an expansion of HPAI for the migratory 
bird population, well, we are working with the industry to try 
to figure out ways in which we can minimize that. But when it 
occurs, egg prices go up because it impacts the supply of eggs. 
So there are a multitude of challenges with reference to food 
prices.
    Ms. Davids of Kansas. Yes, and I appreciate that there are 
a multitude of issues. I do have a couple more questions. I 
will submit them in writing. And the only thing I would say is 
I would love to work with you and your team on finding any 
hiccups that might exist in those interagency, inter-department 
agreements that you have when you are looking at things like 
supply chains.
    Thank you so much. I yield back my time.
    The Chairman [presiding.] The gentlelady yields back. I am 
now pleased to recognize the gentleman from Missouri, Mr. 
Alford, for 5 minutes of questioning.
    Mr. Alford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that. 
Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here. I think you will be 
glad to know that since we last met here a year ago, I boned up 
on pesticides. I am a freshman. I am learning every day about 
the ag industry and how we can help our farmers, ranchers, 
producers in Missouri.
    I have been learning a lot lately about SNAP. And I want to 
be clear that I truly believe, Mr. Secretary, we live in the 
greatest nation known to man. If someone is truly hungry, can't 
work, we should help them on a temporary basis. And I know 
Representative Moore has touched on the SNAP overpayments, but 
I want to clarify just a few things with you today, Mr. 
Secretary. Each day in America there are $30 million in 
overpayments in SNAP, $11 billion a year. Do you consider 
trying to eliminate overpayments, waste, abuse, and fraud as 
making cuts to the SNAP program or taking food away from those 
who rightly qualify for the program?
    Secretary Vilsack. No.
    Mr. Alford. Thank you for that answer. Supplemental 
Nutritional Assistance Program is supposed to be a temporary 
help for those who are truly in need. And of course, we know 
the N stands for nutrition. Yet the second most common SNAP 
purchase is sweetened drinks, $680 million, I believe, in 2022. 
Today, the obesity rate in America is nearly 40 percent, 
putting strain on an already stressed Medicare system. So, Mr. 
Secretary, how do I go home to the 4th Congressional District 
of Missouri and explain to my constituents and taxpayers there 
why we are doing this? Why are we funding to worsen the obesity 
crisis in America?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, Congressman, I think you have to 
kind of dive deep into the utilization of those products. What 
you are going to find, I think, in many cases is that that is a 
substitute for caffeine, a less expensive substitute for 
caffeine, with coffee and tea being more expensive. And many 
families basically use it for that purpose.
    What we try to do in the SNAP program is provide education. 
We try to provide strategies for stretching that food dollar in 
a way that focuses on proper nutrition without stigmatizing 
those who are on SNAP.
    Mr. Alford. Well, Mr. Secretary, I in no way want to 
stigmatize anyone, but clearly, the educational portion of this 
is not working. Our obesity rate is climbing through the roof. 
We are at a financial crossroads now with Medicare and Social 
Security, but this obesity issue I think can be directly 
related in part to poor nutrition in America, and part of that 
because of the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, the challenge I think is--I don't 
believe you are suggesting is, I hope you are not--that it is 
only poor people that are obese or it is only
    Mr. Alford. No, sir, I am not.
    Secretary Vilsack. Okay.
    Mr. Alford. No, sir.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, then, the question then becomes 
what can we do as a country not necessarily stigmatizing or 
setting aside one group of people, but recognizing the obesity 
issue is something that is across the income levels, across 
race, across the entire country.
    Mr. Alford. I do appreciate that.
    Secretary Vilsack. And that is----
    Mr. Alford. That is a great answer. We have to focus in on 
that. But taxpayers should not be paying to make America more 
obese in my opinion.
    Secretary Vilsack. Taxpayers----
    Mr. Alford. Recently, Democratic Representative Jonathan 
Jackson and Don Davis and I filed the FAIR Labels Act of 2024 
(H.R. 7130, Fair and Accurate Ingredient Representation on 
Labels Act of 2024) to ensure consumers are fully informed and 
know the difference between meat from an animal and protein 
grown in the lab or a petri dish. What is the USDA doing to 
inform and protect consumers when it comes to making them aware 
of what the truth is behind the sources of protein?
    Secretary Vilsack. We are working on labeling to make sure 
that they properly represent the product, the characteristics 
of the product. We are working on labeling, just as we are 
working on the product----
    Mr. Alford. How soon will that come out, sir?
    Secretary Vilsack. I don't want to give you a specific 
timeline because I am not confident as I sit here that I know, 
but I will certainly get that to you. We are working on it.
    Mr. Alford. Okay. Thank you.
    Secretary Vilsack. We are working--I will tell you, though, 
that our priority is Product of the USA label, get that through 
the process because we do recognize people were taking 
advantage of that label, and consumers' expectations are not 
being met. There is misrepresentation there. We want to make 
sure that when you go to the grocery store, you see something 
Product of the U.S., you know that everything was done----
    Mr. Alford. Good, let's work together on that, sir. 
Finally, should citizens of adversarial nations, including 
Russia, China, Iran, Cuba, be allowed to purchase any land 
including farmland in the United States of America?
    Secretary Vilsack. That is a tough question, and I will 
tell you why----
    Mr. Alford. You have 20 seconds to answer it.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I will tell you what, let me put 
it this way. It is a tough question. I think the amount of land 
that is being purchased by those folks is minimal. I think 
people have this feeling that it is a lot of the land. It is 
not.
    Mr. Alford. I say one outhouse is too many for a member of 
an----
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, maybe----
    Mr. Alford.--adversarial nation to buy in our precious 
sovereign land----
    Secretary Vilsack. Here is the problem, sir. Here is the 
problem. You also want to sell product to those people, some of 
those people. So when I am talking to the Chinese Ag Minister, 
one of the first things he brings up is this whole notion of 
Syngenta, Arkansas, and so forth. They are our number one 
customer.
    Mr. Alford. Can you go to Russia and buy land?
    Secretary Vilsack. Forget Russia. I am talking about China. 
I am----
    Mr. Alford. Can you go to China?
    Secretary Vilsack. I am talking about China.
    Mr. Alford. You can't have a sponsor, but they have to have 
51 percent----
    Secretary Vilsack. No, you can't.
    Mr. Alford.--sponsorship.
    Secretary Vilsack. And that is how I responded. But the 
reality is that----
    Mr. Alford. I have gone over my time. I do thank you for 
being here.
    Secretary Vilsack. That is our number one----
    Mr. Alford. Thank you.
    Secretary Vilsack.--customer. We have to be sensitive to 
that.
    Mr. Alford. Thank you.
    The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired.
    I am now pleased to recognize the gentlelady from Oregon, 
Congresswoman Salinas, for 5 minutes of questioning.
    Ms. Salinas. Thank you, Chairman Thompson. And thank you, 
Secretary Vilsack, for your leadership at U.S. Department of 
Agriculture. I just want to make a few clarifying points, given 
my colleague from Missouri I think has some things mistaken. 
USDA ERS research has actually shown that SNAP participants 
purchase foods at rates similar to non-participants, and 
studies that actually track the impact of SNAP on the physical 
health of those recipients find that it is linked with improved 
nutritional outcomes, lower healthcare costs, and improved 
current and long-term health.
    And nutrition incentives, as I am sure you are familiar 
with, or what we call Double Up Bucks, those provided via 
GusNIP are far more effective and productive. And would your 
agency be willing to discuss how Congress might work together 
to actually expand those programs?
    Secretary Vilsack. Absolutely. We are excited about those 
programs, and we appreciate the money that came from the 
American Rescue Plan to do so to expand the programs.
    Ms. Salinas. Thank you. Okay. Now on to some of my 
questions for Oregon. Revitalizing rural America is of 
particular importance to Oregon's 6th district, my district, 
and since taking office, I have consistently heard from rural 
towns and communities, as well as local producers and 
landowners that all have a similar message. They are finding it 
really hard to access the resources the Federal Government has 
to offer and really because they may not have the wherewithal 
to complete complex grant applications or follow up with 
reporting requirements.
    Unfortunately, the Rural Partners Network, which was 
established to help communities with precisely this problem, 
has not yet expanded to Oregon. And that is part of the reason 
that I intend to soon introduce the Rural Partnership and 
Prosperity Act (H.R. 7444), which was introduced over on the 
Senate side by Senators Casey and Fischer (S. 3309). The 
legislation would build on the Rural Partners Network via 
project and technical assistance grants.
    Putting that all aside for right now though, could you just 
speak to the genesis of the Rural Partners Network and why it 
is so critical to provide that technical assistance to our 
rural communities so they can actually access programs intended 
precisely for them?
    Secretary Vilsack. That program is really designed and 
specifically focused on persistently poor areas of the country, 
areas that have had a high poverty rate for decades, and it is 
designed to provide sort of intense care, intensive care, and a 
coordinated Federal Government response to the persistent 
poverty. We have asked for additional resources from Congress 
to expand that program. To date, you all have not provided us 
those additional resources.
    Having said that, as a second wave of effort, we are 
expanding significantly the technical assistance grants that we 
are providing with some of our programs. In other words, we are 
setting aside resources to create technical assistance for 
those communities that need that so that we are trying to 
expand it that way. We are using cooperative agreements.
    The other issue that we face is the match requirement. 
Oftentimes, communities would love to be able to participate, 
but they get discouraged because of the match requirements. So 
we are looking at ways in which we can distinguish between 
communities that are capable of making the match and those that 
aren't.
    Ms. Salinas. Thank you. The Inflation Reduction Act 
included $100 million for Wood Innovation Grants. Communities 
throughout Oregon have benefited from these grants, and I have 
introduced bipartisan legislation to actually increase access 
to the program. Can you speak to how these grants can help 
develop markets for forest products, as well as providing your 
overall evaluation of the success of the program?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, it identifies ways in which wood 
products can be used in creative ways. I think it is one of the 
reasons we have seen an expansion of the cross-laminated timber 
or mass timber effort. It started with a grant from one of 
those programs, and now we have over several hundred, if not 
over 1,000 of these tall buildings now being constructed in the 
United States. So we give these grants in order to identify 
market opportunities in order to be able to showcase how wood 
can be used creatively. And we are seeing a pretty robust 
interest in these innovation projects. We are making grants 
every year, and we are seeing an up-tick, if you will, of 
interest in wood and wood products.
    Ms. Salinas. Thank you. And as the Ranking Member on the 
Forestry Subcommittee, I am particularly concerned by the 
dangers posed by increasingly intense wildfire events. And as 
was mentioned, just several years ago in 2020, my state had its 
most destructive and deadly wildfire season ever. And I fear 
unless dramatic investments are made in prevention and 
mitigation, we will see another catastrophic fire season in 
Oregon and across the West.
    As you know, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the 
Inflation Reduction Act provided significant resources in the 
form of both new authority and new funding to the Forest 
Service. Can you speak to how these authorities are better 
enabling the agency to implement the 10 year strategy to 
address the wildfire crisis?
    Secretary Vilsack. We have been able to target and be able 
to get adequate resources to remove hazardous fuel from 
firesheds and from landscapes that we know have high-risk 
potential.
    Ms. Salinas. Thank you.
    Secretary Vilsack. There is a much more extensive answer to 
that, but that is the best I can do it in 5 seconds.
    Ms. Salinas. Thank you. And that is my time. I yield back.
    The Chairman. The gentlelady yields back. I am now pleased 
to recognize, also from Oregon, Congresswoman Chavez-DeRemer 
for 5 minutes of questioning.
    Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good to see 
you, Mr. Secretary, and thank you for coming to testify today. 
I know it has been a long day.
    I have heard from an alarming number of constituents 
concerned about illegal vehicular camping occurring with the 
Deschutes National Forest in my district. These activities are 
not only taking away vital public resources from my 
constituents, but also leading to lasting environmental damage. 
Around Phil's Trailhead and along China Hat Road, there have 
been numerous reports of unsanctioned bonfires, trash dumping, 
and burning, drug usage, dumping of human waste, trespassing 
onto adjacent private property, as well as violent crime 
throughout.
    Not only is there a concern that there is no concrete plan 
of action to address these concerns, but also I am told that 
local volunteer organizations that are trying to work with the 
Forest Service will no longer be deployed due to safety 
concerns. Do you believe the current citation system is 
effective, or are stronger enforcement mechanisms needed to 
ensure that those that are trespassing will be held accountable 
and stop the damage from getting worse?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I think we need to look into that 
particular set of issues. I am more than happy to do that.\4\ 
Thanks for bringing it to our attention. If there needs to be 
stronger enforcement, we will also obviously take a look at 
that. But in the meantime, let's figure out what we can do with 
the specific concerns that you have expressed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ The information referred to is located on p. 174.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. So you will commit to work with my 
office and the local agencies to find the solutions that are 
workable for us both?
    Secretary Vilsack. Sure.
    Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. Thank you. I would also like to note 
that my office is aware of the Northwest Forest Plan Federal 
Advisory Committee planning session that recently happened in 
Eugene, Oregon. The FAC was established to bring in different 
perspectives to amend the Northwest Forest Plan. I would hope 
that our office would be seen as a partner in any discussions 
involving our Northwest forest areas and will be involved in 
any future correspondence.
    But moving on, it was recently discovered that a Chinese 
billionaire--now I know my colleague mentioned these about 
foreign ownership of U.S. farmland after an $85 million 
purchase and nearly 200,000 acres of timberland in Oregon went 
unchecked for nearly 10 years. Ownership of U.S. farmland by 
foreign adversaries not only makes U.S. farmers and ranchers 
uneasy about our nation's food security, but it also poses 
serious concerns about the ability for the next generation of 
farmers to access land and begin farming and ranching for 
themselves.
    I heard your answer previously, but, Mr. Secretary, do you 
believe that there are effective enforcement mechanisms 
existing within the USDA currently to ensure foreign land 
ownership does not go unchecked, or are more enforcement 
abilities needed within the USDA or another agency?
    Secretary Vilsack. More is needed because right now, we 
have a self-reporting system. There are over 3,000 county 
recorder offices in the country. It is very difficult for USDA 
to monitor all 3,000 county recorder offices for deeds that are 
being filed. So I think there is a need for a conversation 
about precisely how far folks want to go to be able to know 
what transactions are taking place. Do you want a public 
database where every transaction of real estate in this country 
will be funneled into a single database that the Federal 
Government will have access to?
    Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. Well, certainly to go unchecked. And 
in this particular case, the purchaser was tied to the Chinese 
Communist Party, and that is why I questioned that.
    Secretary Vilsack. Sure.
    Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. So I do hope that we can move further 
on this issue. I have a specific letter in to your office 
asking that.
    So let's move on. I want to highlight that in Oregon wheat 
growers rely heavily on utilizing the Columbia Snake River 
system, as 90 percent of Oregon wheat is exported and over 60 
percent of all U.S. wheat is transported through the river 
systems to markets overseas. This transportation method not 
only is safe and efficient, but it also is cost-effective. Mr. 
Secretary, if the Lower Snake River dams were to be breached 
and we lose this valuable transportation system, do you believe 
we will be able to continue to transport this volume of wheat 
to meet the global market demands?
    Secretary Vilsack. I think Congress has the ability to 
determine whether or not a dam is going to be breached, and so 
you would obviously have the ability to stop that if there was 
a problem with agriculture.
    Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. But do you believe that if this 
transportation is so valuable----
    Secretary Vilsack. It is.
    Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer.--would we be able to continue to 
transport the wheat volume if those Lower Snake dams were 
removed?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I would assume that you wouldn't 
let that happen.
    Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. I won't have time for this next 
question on some labor questions, so I will submit it for the 
record, Mr. Chairman. And with that, I yield back my time.
    The Chairman. The gentlelady yields back. I now recognize 
the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Jackson, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Jackson of Illinois. Thank you, Chairman Thompson. 
Great to see you again and glad we have reconvened.
    Once again, Secretary Vilsack, I am honored to call you the 
Secretary of Agriculture. I can rest well knowing there is 
something in Washington that is working exceedingly well, and 
that is your advocacy on behalf of all of Americans and our 
food security.
    Specifically, I would like to ask you about research has 
shown that individuals in rural areas and small towns 
participate in SNAP at higher rates than individuals in urban 
areas. Additionally, USDA's Economic Research Service recently 
found that SNAP benefit spending disproportionately increased 
economic outputs in rural areas when compared to SNAP economic 
output in urban areas. Can you address the misconception that 
SNAP is a program predominantly utilized in cities and 
elaborate on how SNAP supports rural communities and combats 
food insecurity in rural areas?
    Secretary Vilsack. Congressman, I think there are a lot of 
misconceptions about SNAP, and I think it stems from who people 
think are on SNAP. I think people find it surprising that a 
significant number of people on SNAP are actually working. I 
think most people outside of those of us who know about the 
program think that it is all about people that aren't working. 
In fact, it is people that are working. I think the belief that 
there are a lot of folks who are able-bodied and should be 
working.
    The reality is that is a relatively small percentage of the 
SNAP population. I don't think people realize that senior 
citizens are a population in SNAP. People with disabilities are 
in SNAP, working families are in SNAP, and a lot of children 
are involved in that SNAP program. So I think it starts and 
begins with the misunderstanding about who is receiving the 
benefits of SNAP. And then from that you begin to think that 
that must be an urban-centric group of people, but it is 
absolutely not. It is across the country. It is wherever 
poverty is, and poverty is everywhere.
    Mr. Jackson of Illinois. And so a follow-up question on 
that, you have heard the practice of corporations actually 
steering people to these benefits on SNAP. Could you elaborate 
on that?
    Secretary Vilsack. There have been in the past companies 
that have suggested or have encouraged or have made available 
information about programs. I don't know if they are 
aggressively suggesting people sign up, but making them aware 
of. And I think that is part of the challenge. I mean, it is a 
balance.
    Mr. Jackson of Illinois. So can we conclude that there is a 
struggle for American workers, and food insecurity is a major 
issue within the country?
    Secretary Vilsack. There is no doubt that there are many, 
many, many working poor, working poor with an emphasis on 
working, people who are working a part-time job, multiple part-
time jobs, or a full-time job at a minimum wage. And you know 
this. If you raise the minimum wage, you would reduce the SNAP 
population by a significant amount.
    Mr. Jackson of Illinois. A follow-up question regarding the 
economic benefits of SNAP. The USDA has been very successful in 
getting more small businesses to participate in SNAP. Is there 
anything Congress needs to do to support this work? Can you 
elaborate more on how SNAP is benefiting our farmers, 
retailers, and the overall economy, in addition to servicing 
low-income households?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, the reality is if people have the 
ability to buy more product at a grocery store, they are going 
to do it. And when they do it, it means that everybody in that 
supply chain, from the person who stocked it, to the person who 
packaged it, to who processed it, who produced it, who 
transported it, those jobs are all connected. And if you look 
at some of the major retailers, you will find that a 
significant percentage of their business is SNAP-oriented. So 
if you take SNAP and you reduce it or you eliminate it, you are 
obviously going to impact not just the poor families that are 
receiving it, but you are also going to impact all those people 
whose jobs are somewhat dependent on it.
    Mr. Jackson of Illinois. Are there any other comments that 
you care to make before I yield back my time, Mr. Secretary?
    Secretary Vilsack. There a lot of comments I would like to 
make, but I think I will just pass.
    Mr. Jackson of Illinois. Well, I would like to say once 
again, Mr. Vilsack, thank you for your many, many years of 
service and your knowledge. And let it be recorded that you 
have gone through this Committee numerous times. You have taken 
all these questions really without notes. And you have been in 
for 3 hours. You have gone without lunch, once again, as you 
fight for American families. And thank you for your service 
again.
    Chairman Thompson, I yield back my time.
    The Chairman. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize 
the gentleman from California, Mr. LaMalfa, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Thank you, Secretary, for your time and effort here today 
and what you do. I can't let that dam removal bit on the system 
that Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer was talking about go by. Yes, that 
will be very devastating for the shipping of crops in that 
area, as it has been devastating in my northern California area 
with the removal of the Klamath dams partly underway now and 
the filth and stink and stench and muck that is moving down the 
Klamath River ostensibly to be helping fish, the wildlife that 
has been wiped out there. The fish, you see hundreds of dead 
fish in the photos and deer that have been trapped out there 
the Fish and Game (California Department of Fish and Wildlife) 
had to shoot, all sorts of things going on with that.
    And then also on the hit list--and that is devastating 
agriculture in the Klamath Basin, as well as the water being 
taken away from the Scott and Shasta Rivers down below. Also 
the Eel River, where there is a dam slated to--on the hit list 
there that will devastate part of wine country. So dam removal 
is not something that Congress controls. Otherwise, we would 
have put a stop to that. It is runaway agencies and 
environmental groups.
    So the issue with forestry in my district in the West, we 
have suffered the Camp Fire a few years ago: 85 people lost 
their lives in the Paradise area. And then the Dixie Fire a 
couple years later, a million-acre fire, in addition to the 
many hundreds of thousands of acres of fire, individual 100,000 
acre fires. As you know, in the whole West, it is millions per 
year.
    So the issue comes down to what is Forest Service doing and 
the other entities--but we are talking about Forest Service--on 
Federal lands to get the job done? I know they, a couple years 
ago, put out a concept of 20 million over 10 years of forest 
treatment. Well, they have about 200 million acres in their 
purview. So that would mean 2 million acres per year, over 200 
million acres. That would take 100 years to cover that if they 
were actually doing that.
    So we have given tools in past farm bills and are trying to 
enhance that in this current farm bill with more categorical 
exclusions to help move the ball, but they haven't taken 
advantage of it. As of recently, it only put a handful of them 
out to move that. We have good demonstrations. We had a Tahoe 
project some years ago that, when wildfire hit that, the fire 
basically stopped where that treatment had happened, other 
areas where treatment happened on private lands.
    So, Secretary, what can we do to get the Forest Service to 
act and stop the lengthy delays in the project planning process 
and use these categorical exclusions as we are trying to 
advance more so in the farm bill and make larger areas, 10,000, 
15,000 acres, which is a drop in the bucket on the millions of 
acres?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, first of all, Congressman, 85 
percent of the work that is being done is being done under the 
CE effort, so we are utilizing that tool on our ongoing, 
regular, consistent basis.
    Mr. LaMalfa. It looks good, but 85 percent of how much?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, 85 percent--well, last year, I 
think we did 4.2 million acres. And not every acre of land, 
obviously, is the same, so what we have been able to do is 
identify where the risks are the highest. We have established 
about 250 priority firesheds, where we are providing resources 
for treatment because we see that as the highest risk. And each 
year, we are making the mark and meeting the mark that we set 
for treatment. And then we are following up in areas that had 
been devastated in the past with reforestation efforts.
    Mr. LaMalfa. But part of the problem is that in certain 
situations, burned acres are counted as treatment, and so----
    Secretary Vilsack. No----
    Mr. LaMalfa.--when you are looking at the overall volume 
that we have to do, we have millions of acres we have to get 
done and chip--what I am getting at is we have to have the 
private-sector--we have to use all possible tools, Good 
Neighbor Authority, we need Tribes, we need local governments, 
we need cooperation and not just----
    Secretary Vilsack. All that is being done.
    Mr. LaMalfa.--slow----
    Secretary Vilsack. All those tools are being used in a very 
extensive way.
    Mr. LaMalfa. But to the volume, I am talking pace and 
scale. We have to scale it up dramatically or we are going to 
keep burning millions.
    Let me shift quickly to the climate-smart. I am looking at 
some of the figures on that. First of all, on the goals, what 
are we hoping to reach? That is a 5 year program, right?
    Secretary Vilsack. Correct.
    Mr. LaMalfa. Okay. And it was funded by the IRA, right?
    Secretary Vilsack. No. It was funded by----
    Mr. LaMalfa. Well, there was a kick-in of money towards 
that from the IRA, right?
    Secretary Vilsack. No.
    Mr. LaMalfa. CCC. All right, thank you. But there was an 
influx of dollars to--anyway, what I am getting at, I see the 
stated goal of 60 million metric tons of CO<INF>2</INF>. What 
is our baseline? What percent of the atmosphere right now is 
CO<INF>2</INF>?
    Secretary Vilsack. I don't know what the percent is. The 
idea here is isn't so much the specific amount. It is learning 
what works and what doesn't work so that we can make sure that 
in the future we are using resources, conservation resources in 
the most effective----
    Mr. LaMalfa. Okay. Tell me this then, because farmers are 
going to have to change practices to participate, and they 
could be frozen out----
    Secretary Vilsack. No, no, no.
    Mr. LaMalfa.--if everybody is doing this. I am a farmer in 
my real life, too. I farm rice. And so basically, if 
CO<INF>2</INF> tie-up means no-till, I do not have that as an 
option, whereas my neighboring crop might have no-till as an 
option, I don't. So we are going to be left behind. Farmers 
like the current conservation programs that are out there, EQIP 
and the others, but this new one here is going to require them 
to jump through hoops in order to maybe be competitive or not. 
So just can you just close on that, and I will yield?
    Secretary Vilsack. Can I----
    Mr. LaMalfa. Go ahead.
    Secretary Vilsack. Do you want me to respond?
    Mr. LaMalfa. Please. Please, Secretary.
    Secretary Vilsack. It is voluntary. It basically creates an 
opportunity for us to learn what works and what doesn't work. 
And it doesn't necessarily put people at a competitive 
disadvantage at all because you also have the regular 
conservation programs that they are utilizing. And it is not 
requiring them to go through a series of hoops. In some cases, 
it is actually paying them for what they are already doing. But 
the idea here is to measure, monitor, and verify the results so 
that we know what works and what doesn't work so that we don't 
invest in what doesn't work.
    Mr. LaMalfa. Okay. The CO<INF>2</INF> number is .04 percent 
in the atmosphere. I yield back.
    The Chairman. Okay.
    Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you.
    The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired. I now 
recognize the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Sorensen, for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Sorensen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    As the only meteorologist in Congress, I knew the answer to 
that. I couldn't help you, Mr. Secretary, sorry. But thank you 
for taking the time. I know it has been a long day. And as a 
meteorologist who worked in western Illinois for so long, I 
tracked many of the storms that went over Mount Pleasant, Iowa.
    I did want to talk about what producers back home are 
talking about. They have underscored the need for regionally 
specific data to help them identify the right conservation 
practices for them that will improve soil health, build 
resilience, and sequester more carbon, quite simply, being 
smart with respect to changing climate.
    My bipartisan bill, Advancing Research on Agricultural 
Climate Impacts Act of 2023 (H.R. 5160), or ARACI, will help 
the USDA develop a standardized methodology to monitor and 
inventory regional soil carbon. It also establishes a national 
soil carbon network so that farmers can access local data 
without disclosing proprietary information to determine which 
practices work best to improve soil health. Of the $20 billion 
in Inflation Reduction Act conservation funding, $300 million 
is designated to improve soil carbon measurement. So could you 
provide details on how the $300 million has been spent thus far 
to address soil carbon MMRV?
    Secretary Vilsack. It has been set up in a multitude of 
ways, Congressman, to establish basically not only a soil 
carbon monitoring network, which is a series of pilots, a 
series of locations across the country where we can do exactly 
what you are asking us to do, to learn regionally what the 
differences might be.
    We are also setting up a greenhouse gas emission network to 
do similar work. We are going to take information, try to 
figure out are there better ways to manage the data, better 
ways to use technology, better ways to use artificial 
intelligence, and so forth, to be able to analyze the 
information. And from that, we want to be able to convert that 
into better tools and models for producers across the country 
to be able to utilize so that they have a better sense for 
their farm, for their operation what works and what doesn't 
work. So there is a rather coordinated effort within USDA in a 
number of mission areas to essentially use these resources to 
get data, to analyze the data, and convert it into meaningful 
tools for producers.
    Mr. Sorensen. I want to turn to the interest in solar for 
just a moment on agricultural land specifically, our 
agrivoltaics. This is rapidly increasing as we strive to 
achieve our renewable energy goals. However, I represent some 
of the most fertile land in the world. I have producers today 
that say, ``What are we supposed to do when we have an offer 
for $1,200 an acre for solar on our farms?'' Mr. Secretary, can 
you elaborate on some of the reasons why it is essential that 
we develop sound regional guidance that identifies the best 
practices for where we put solar in agriculture?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I think it is an opportunity for 
nonproductive land to be more productive, and so identifying 
where that is and encouraging the location. One of the things 
we are doing with our PACE and New ERA program was to have a 
series of listening sessions to address this issue of where 
does it make sense to have large-scale solar operations, and 
where doesn't it make sense so that people are sensitive to 
this.
    I think it is also an issue of technology. What we are 
learning now is that people are beginning to look at a 
different configuration of solar farms so that you could 
essentially have a solar farm and a livestock operation 
simultaneously.
    Mr. Sorensen. Right.
    Secretary Vilsack. So I think there is a combination of 
things that we need to be doing here.
    Mr. Sorensen. There is so much ahead and the all-of-the-
above approach is important. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.
    I want to conclude with this. Today, there is a significant 
concern regarding the impact that proposed cuts by the House 
GOP to the IRA conservation funding and Thrifty Food Plan 
reevaluation will have on both small-town businesses and our 
farm families. To my colleagues and my families back home, 
raiding programs that invest in high-demand conservation and 
nutrition initiatives like SNAP do not achieve a bipartisan 
farm bill, but instead they hurt the people who are struggling 
today.
    Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has committed to 
finding billions of dollars outside of the Senate Agriculture 
Committee's jurisdiction to help us pass a bipartisan farm bill 
in the Senate. I urge my colleagues to bring this. Working 
families across our country depend on it. Family farmers depend 
on it. Kids depend on it. And, Mr. Secretary, it is my hope 
that we can get a bipartisan farm bill across the finish line 
because it is that important.
    And, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    The Chairman. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize 
the gentleman from Wisconsin, the cheese king of Congress, Mr. 
Van Orden----
    Mr. Van Orden. That is correct.
    The Chairman.--for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Van Orden. Write that down, Mr. Secretary. Thank you, 
Mr. Chairman. Thanks for coming. It has been a very long day.
    And so what I would like to do is I just--I am a freshman, 
so I am at the tail end of everything. So I just solicited a 
bunch of my constituents, so these questions are coming 
directly from my constituents. The first one is going to come 
from Organic Valley, which is headquartered in La Farge, 
Wisconsin. It is not some left coast thing. That is from the 
middle of my district. It is awesome. And here is what they 
want to ask you.
    Secretary Vilsack, dairy is an economic engine for the 
upper Midwest and provides bountiful nutrition for millions of 
Americans. We are very glad that the House passed the Whole 
Milk for Healthy Kids Act (H.R. 1147), which is awesome. We 
need more milk options for schools and making sure that they 
can have whole milk if they choose to. I am really interested 
in solving the problems and leveraging private industry to make 
investments in dairy.
    One of the efforts USDA offers is the Dairy Business 
Innovation Initiative, and these initiatives convene farmers, 
industrial partners, academia to tackle production, processing, 
marketing, and the marketing needs of the dairy industry 
specific to each initiative's coverage area. Focused on 
enhancing the capacity and vitality of the dairy industry, the 
programs offer grants to industry participants.
    We would like to know how strong is the demand for the 
DBIs? And can you tell us how many projects are funded? That is 
the first part. How many applications are received, the second 
part. How much funding is requested by companies and farmers 
applying, and how we are measuring the effectiveness of each 
DBI?
    Secretary Vilsack. I think I understand the question.
    Mr. Van Orden. Yes.
    Secretary Vilsack. And if I don't and I don't answer it, we 
will be glad to get the answer.
    Mr. Van Orden. Very well.
    Secretary Vilsack. I believe there are four of these in the 
country.
    Mr. Van Orden. Yes.
    Secretary Vilsack. We allocated $20 million to each of the 
four.
    Mr. Van Orden. Yes.
    Secretary Vilsack. And they make decisions based on where 
those resources need to be allocated.
    Mr. Van Orden. Okay.
    Secretary Vilsack. So they would have the information in 
terms of the number of grants and specific investments.
    Mr. Van Orden. Okay.
    Secretary Vilsack. So, we don't control--once we give the 
resources to the innovation center, it is the innovation center 
that makes the determination.
    Mr. Van Orden. So if we could get that information from 
these guys later, or if you could help us do that, I would 
appreciate it greatly.\5\

    Here is the next one. We heard from our organic dairy 
farmers and organic milk buyers that the Federal Milk Marketing 
Orders offer no benefit or value for organic milk and have no 
bearing on day-to-day organic milk prices. The most recent FMMO 
hearings that concluded this past month did not review a 
proposal to exempt organic milk from pooling obligations, 
leaving hundreds of organic farmers frustrated and 
disappointed. Is the USDA willing to hear a proposal and 
establish a hearing on the role of organic milk in the Federal 
Milk Marketing Orders?
    Secretary Vilsack. I mean, the challenge is the 
underpinning of a Milk Marketing Order is participation by 
dairy producers. And I think it is a complicated question they 
are asking that would require us to kind of think about ways in 
which it wouldn't necessarily compromise or jeopardize the 
traditional dairy producer if we were to set up a separate 
program. We will see what happens with the Federal Milk 
Marketing Order hearing that just concluded.
    Mr. Van Orden. Yes.
    Secretary Vilsack. Over 12,000 pages of transcript now 
being reviewed.
    Mr. Van Orden. And, sir, I have a couple more through the 
guy, so this is from our hog producers. They are losing an 
average of $30 per head due to high input costs. What can the 
USDA do to support our hog producers to ensure that they can 
pass on these operations to the next generation?
    Secretary Vilsack. We continue to purchase pork through our 
surplus programs. We continue to promote pork exports. I mean, 
that is two ways of providing assistance and help.
    Mr. Van Orden. Okay. And then where do you stand on Prop 12 
in California?
    Secretary Vilsack. Where do I stand on it?
    Mr. Van Orden. What are your thoughts? I know it went to 
the Supreme Court and said Congress should act. I agree with 
the Supreme Court. We should be acting.
    Secretary Vilsack. The problem is that essentially every 
state can do this, and I think it is chaotic. It is going to be 
chaotic.
    Mr. Van Orden. Okay. And then the Wisconsin Farm Bureau 
would like us to highlight, the change in dairy pricing for me 
has negatively affected dairy farmers across the country, and 
Wisconsin is losing about one dairy farm a day. Many of my 
constituents are asking the USDA to use their emergency powers 
to change the dairy pricing formula from the ``average of'' to 
the ``higher of.'' No one has testified in opposition to 
changing this formula. The USDA is considering making the 
change through the FMMO hearing process that just concluded. We 
talked about that. Unfortunately, they are on step 5 of 12 in 
the process. Dairy farmers can't wait till 2025. Do you support 
accelerating this process?
    Secretary Vilsack. I am not prepared to answer that 
question because I need to have a better understanding of 
exactly what you are asking.
    [The information referred to is located on p. 174.]
    Mr. Van Orden. Okay.
    Secretary Vilsack. What I would do is give you this, which 
will provide you some information on how we are helping the 
dairy industry----
    Mr. Van Orden. Okay.
    Secretary Vilsack.--the pretty significant amount of help 
that we are----
    Mr. Van Orden. Well, thank you, sir. And, Mr. Chairman, I 
have several more questions I would like to enter for the 
record. They are coming from our corn growers.
    The Chairman. Without objection.
    [The questions referred (Questions 3-5) to are located on 
p. 221-222.]
    Mr. Van Orden. All right. Thank you very much, sir, and I 
yield back. Thank you for your time.
    The Chairman. You are welcome. Now I am pleased to 
recognize the gentlelady from Michigan, I have to say an early 
cosponsor of Whole Milk for Healthy Kids, Congresswoman 
Slotkin, for 5 minutes of questions.
    Ms. Slotkin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You are almost done. 
You are getting down to the dregs of us here, so almost out.
    Mr. Secretary, you have answered it in a couple different 
ways, but just to put a sharper point on it, my questions have 
to do with this concept of foreign ownership of American land, 
farmland. Last time you were here in March I asked you about 
this. You pushed back that, in a state like Michigan, the 
majority of foreign land is owned by the Canadians by far, the 
Dutch, folks who are our friends. But since then, the GAO and 
others have come out I think you have heard a bipartisan 
concern about adversarial states, a very small handful of 
states who we could have a potential problem with down the 
road.
    Myself and Representative Feenstra from this Committee put 
together something that we tried to make real, which is that 
when a foreign entity from an adversarial country tries to buy 
farmland, they would just go through a national security 
review. This is exactly what happens if farmland right now 
wants to be sold to a foreign country of any kind next to a 
military base. I am from the Department of Defense. So we have 
a process, but it is just very limited.
    How do you think about a process where we wouldn't be 
clamping down and saying ``No'' unilaterally, but there would 
be a national security review of the sale to foreigners of 
farmland?
    Secretary Vilsack. Yes, I have suggested that USDA ought to 
be part of the CIFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment in the 
United States) process, which is an extension of your question. 
I think that would be fine.
    Ms. Slotkin. Okay. And part of that bill is giving you a 
seat at the table on CIFIUS, which is our long-standing 
process. I think it would be great if there was a bill that you 
liked, and then we could push forward since I do think it is a 
bipartisan issue.
    The second question, from Michigan, our tagline now is we 
are the most diverse agricultural state in the country with 
regular access to water, right? That is our dig at California. 
And because of that, you know that we have cherry farmers, 
stone fruit farmers, asparagus, mint, we have a ton of smaller 
farmers, not monocropping. And the number one issue they raise 
with me when I sit with them is the cost, reliability, and 
availability of labor, right? Our kids don't go and work on 
farms anymore in the summer in the same ways. So getting that 
H-2A program is vital for our farmers.
    And they keep talking to me about the mandatory increases 
in the wages for those coming to work on their farms, not that 
they don't want people to make decent wages, but how are we 
asking them to increase year over year when their profits 
aren't going up, right, just kind of basic bake sale math? We 
have talked with the Secretary of Labor about this. But can you 
confirm, do you have any tools in your toolkit as the Secretary 
of Agriculture that would be able to provide waivers, for 
instance, for our smallest farms, for little guys who just 
can't afford these increases?
    Secretary Vilsack. We don't have that, but what we did do 
is create this farm labor stabilization pilot with $63 million 
from the American Rescue Plan and put it out there for 
producers of all kinds and all sizes and all states. We got 
over 300 applications for assistance. And we are in the process 
of trying to figure out, among those 300 operations, who is 
going to get resources. And what struck me in connection with 
this was that most of the people applying wanted to have a 
higher threshold in terms of wage levels, in terms of 
healthcare, in terms of housing for their employees. We 
expected them to go in sort of at the base level where the 
costs would be significantly less, but we had more applications 
at the higher level, which I thought was interesting.
    Ms. Slotkin. Yes. But that program is closed, right? There 
is not a relief program for current small farmers?
    Secretary Vilsack. We don't have anything available as you 
suggested.
    Ms. Slotkin. Okay.
    It is just hard, as someone who is in the Executive Branch 
and a national security person, to understand that there is 
literally no special authority to make very, very rare 
decisions for the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of 
Labor, all these folks. You can understand how farmers feel 
like it is a bureaucratic answer that, ``Well, we can't do 
anything, we can't do anything.'' Are you sure there is not a 
special authority that you have for waivers or to do something 
more on this issue? Have you looked at every legal possibility?
    Secretary Vilsack. I have.
    Ms. Slotkin. Okay.
    Secretary Vilsack. And I will tell you why it is 
frustrating to have these questions asked.
    Ms. Slotkin. Yes.
    Secretary Vilsack. Because you all had the ability to get 
this solved, and farmers had the ability to get this solved by 
supporting the Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2021, which 
would have capped a level, but it didn't get through. Why 
didn't it get through? Politics.
    Ms. Slotkin. Yes. And I am a cosponsor of that bill. Okay. 
Well, thank you for your attention to the issue, and thanks for 
being here. I yield back.
    The Chairman. The gentlelady--and for the record, it did 
pass out of the House.
    Secretary Vilsack. I know it did with a bipartisan vote, 
bipartisan vote, and it had a majority of Members of the 
Senate----
    The Chairman. And it got hung up in the Senate.
    Secretary Vilsack. It is frustrating.
    The Chairman. Unfortunately, some of the more difficult 
points were just a few, were not addressed in the Senate.
    I am now pleased to recognize the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. 
Miller, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Miller of Ohio. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking 
Member. And, Mr. Secretary, it is good to see you again. I 
remember the first comments you gave me that I am usually the 
last person to go here, and you are a very patient young man. 
Well, I got to tell you, Mr. Secretary, you are a very patient 
Secretary, so thank you.
    Agriculture is one of Ohio's largest industries, and our 
state ranks 9th in the nation in the number of farms. However, 
I have heard firsthand from farmers and livestock producers in 
my Congressional district and through local leaders in my 
Agriculture Advisory Council key concerns impacting farm 
economies throughout the northeast Ohio region. More troubling 
is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's most recent farm income 
forecasts released just last week, indicating a 25.5 percent 
decrease in farm income from 2023. And I know that was touched 
on earlier.
    Major priorities I have heard resound from our region's 
farmers include strengthening the farm safety net, ensuring 
viable access to risk management tools, incentive-based 
conservation initiatives, innovative technology, research, 
expanding biofuels, trade market promotion, safeguarding animal 
health, USDA meat inspection partnerships, robust career 
technical education, including training tools to lift the 
underserved, and key areas to strengthen Ohio's farm economy.
    I have several questions, including the rising agricultural 
trade deficit of $30 billion and loss of trade opportunities 
expanding crop markets through sustainable aviation fuels, 
including my bipartisan, bicameral Farm to Fly Act of 2023 
(H.R. 6271/S. 3637) and critical GREET modeling updates, and on 
behalf of the Ohio Department of Agriculture, concerns related 
to cost-share partnerships in meat inspections. If we are not 
able to cover all of my questions today, which I know that we 
are not, I am going to submit them. But I would respectfully 
ask if you guys could give us a response in writing.
    So trade, while international trade is critical to Ohio and 
United States agricultural producers, USDA's most recent 
outlook for the U.S. agricultural trade signaled the 
agricultural trade deficit nearly doubled last year, rising to 
$30 billion, straining the ability of U.S. producers to meet 
global food demands. The USDA report detailed trade losses as 
driven by reductions in grain and feed livestock, poultry, and 
dairy exports. For this reason, I am working with several of my 
colleagues, including Representatives Duarte, Craig, and 
Feenstra, on a letter to you and Ambassador Tai seeking strong 
U.S. leadership in global agricultural trade.
    Mr. Secretary--finally, I get to the question. I am out of 
breath. So, Mr. Secretary, for roughly 60 years, the U.S. ran 
an agricultural trade surplus, while that is no longer the 
case, and over 30 major U.S. farm organizations through the 
President's Export Council have called to expand export market 
opportunities for United States food and agriculture. Can you 
please detail your plans to address this trade deficit and 
empower American producers to remain leaders in the global 
trade market?
    Secretary Vilsack. We recently announced our regional 
Agricultural Promotion Program designed to expand opportunities 
in some of the lesser-known market opportunities, which we 
think will allow us to diversify so we are no longer as totally 
reliant on China. The reality is, when the Chinese economy 
suffers, basically, exports suffer. When our economy is 
stronger than any other economy in the industrialized world, 
our consumers are able to purchase more, the world's consumers 
are able to purchase less. That impacts exports.
    The fact that we, for too many years, ignored our 
infrastructure needs, allowed our competitors to catch up with 
us, now we are trying to address the infrastructure needs. That 
is also part of it. But we did put this RAPP program together 
in an effort to try to invest in more presence, more trade 
missions, more promotions, more ability to get the word out 
about U.S. products. I think we will be cost-competitive, and I 
think you are going to continue to see an up-tick in exports. 
We did have record years in exports the last couple of years, 
and I expect and anticipate that we will get that surplus back, 
but it is going to take a year or two.
    Mr. Miller of Ohio. Yes, and thank you for that detailed 
answer. And I know you look at this through this lens--and I am 
speculating, so I shouldn't speak for you or anybody else--but 
with trade comes national security implications in terms of 
strengthening our relationships with foreign countries. And all 
I ask is that we continue to explore any of those opportunities 
as the world is how it is right now, and looking to strengthen 
our relationships with just people around the globe, I think, 
is extremely beneficial.
    I am just going to go right into what I talked about 
earlier about agriculture and meat inspection cost-share. I am 
just going to go right to the question, Mr. Secretary. Given 
the critical nature of broadening meat inspection capabilities, 
which I understand has been a priority to this Administration, 
what options is USDA considering providing the maximum 50 
percent reimbursement to state meat inspection programs?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, if we have a budget, we are in a 
position to do more, so pass a budget.
    Mr. Miller of Ohio. Well, I am going to go ahead and say 
that is going to be an impossible task right now.
    Secretary Vilsack. Okay.
    Mr. Miller of Ohio. Second--actually, we are out of time, 
Mr. Secretary. I have the questions. I will submit them to you. 
Thank you for your time, and thank you for your patience.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    The Chairman. The gentleman yields back. I now recognizes 
the gentleman from New York, Mr. Molinaro, for 5 minutes of 
questioning.
    Mr. Molinaro. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And thank you, Mr. Secretary. I was happy to have you visit 
the east part of upstate New York's 19th Congressional 
District. I would welcome you back to the west part of upstate 
New York's 19th Congressional District, Cornell, I think, and a 
lot of rural communities would love to have you visit.
    I come from a local government background, and I continue 
to hear from municipal leaders and community leaders about the 
lack of access to technical assistance for rural development 
grants through the USDA. You kind of addressed this, I think, 
in a good-natured way. I would like to return to the question 
though. By nature, rural development grants are intended to 
support rural communities. And of course, in many cases, they 
don't have the technical expertise or the staff or even the 
time to fulfill those grant application requirements.
    So right now, the USDA, as you know, continues to announce 
new pools of funding available for everything from energy to 
infrastructure, manufacturing, and beyond, but the fundamental 
problem still exists. I think you recognize that small 
municipalities and farmers don't have the capacity to access 
these programs. And, sadly, funding is being distributed 
unevenly and in many ways inefficiently. Could you discuss with 
us why would USDA announce new initiatives, some authorized, 
some not, without having the capacity to assist farmers and 
municipalities? And how might that be remedied?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, with due respect, Congressman, I 
don't think that is accurate. I think we have invested through 
expanded cooperative agreements and contracts with a number of 
organizations and entities that are helping farmers all across 
the country being able to access programs and assist them in 
basically applying for programs.
    Mr. Molinaro. Yes, I don't think that this is anecdotal. It 
is certainly not in New York. Farmers have consistently seen 
the inability to access that technical assistance.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, we have literally over 100 
organizations that we are contracting with on NRCS, 30 
organizations that we are contracting with FSA, so the 
assistance is there and the help is there. We are also, as part 
of a number of the new initiatives we have set aside, as I said 
earlier, a series of resources to be able to provide for 
technical assistance.
    And plus, I was a mayor of a small town, so I came from a 
local government background also. And what I do know is that 
many, many states have regional economic development councils, 
councils of government that basically provide that service. I 
am surprised that New York doesn't have those kinds of regional 
local government assistance programs to basically help with the 
grant writing. Have you--I mean, I don't know if--I can't 
imagine that New York doesn't have those----
    Mr. Molinaro. New York does not have an institution for 
municipal assistance when it comes to grant writing. But I am 
heartened to hear that you don't believe there is additional 
need to meet those new initiatives. I just would say again 
that, without question, farmers and communities have 
consistently said this to me, certainly now in this role, but I 
experienced it as a county executive and village mayor myself. 
But----
    Secretary Vilsack. Let me also say we are simplifying the 
process. We have cut the application process, for example, for 
loans in half. We have created a loan assistance program. We 
are using technology on our website to maybe make it a little 
bit easier, so we have simplified the program.
    Mr. Molinaro. I appreciate that. I would encourage then the 
continued earnest look at making those greater efficiencies. 
And certainly, we will communicate where we think in the state, 
certainly in New York, there are some concerns.
    I did want to ask at least one other question. One area of 
obvious concern for us in upstate New York is as it relates to 
our dairy farms and fair milk pricing. With the recent 
conclusion of the FMMO hearing, farmers are anxiously waiting 
for final determination from the USDA with some optimism that 
the Class I mover will be restored to the ``higher of'' the 
pricing system. Can you provide to us any insight as to the 
next steps for the USDA and estimated timeline for a decision 
announcement?
    Secretary Vilsack. An analysis of over 12,000 pages of 
transcript, hundreds of exhibits needs to be analyzed and 
reviewed by their folks at USDA, and the economists and so 
forth at USDA. That is going to take some time, but our 
expectation is that we are going to try to get this done this 
year.
    Mr. Molinaro. So your estimation is sometime within the 
next 10 to 11 months?
    Secretary Vilsack. Sooner than that probably.
    Mr. Molinaro. Okay. I certainly would follow up as it is of 
concern to obviously many farmers across America, but upstate 
New York is struggling in this space as well.
    With that, I will submit some additional questions, Mr. 
Secretary. Again, you have an open invitation to visit the west 
end of upstate New York. The folks at Cornell would love to see 
you.
    Secretary Vilsack. Thank you.
    The Chairman. The gentleman yields back. I am now pleased 
to recognize the gentlelady from Florida, Congresswoman 
Cammack, for 5 minutes of questioning.
    Mrs. Cammack. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. 
Secretary, for coming before the Committee.
    I will jump right into it. As my colleagues and I, here on 
this Committee, have repeatedly said, ``Food security is 
national security,'' and it is important that we do everything 
we can to support and protect American-grown products. Now, as 
you know, unfair competition from foreign imports is a growing 
problem for our producers. And specifically in Florida, without 
seasonal or perishable protections, this is a growing concern. 
We know that Mexico has unfair schemes targeting Florida 
producers specifically. And I know that many of my colleagues 
have raised similar issues on everything from peaches and honey 
and apple juice from China to seafood from Russia, all of which 
is ending up in American schools.
    So, specifically, what is USDA doing to ensure that 
American-grown products are being served in American schools? 
And is there a requirement for American-grown products to be 
used in schools?
    Secretary Vilsack. There is a requirement that food that we 
purchase has to be produced and processed and every aspect of 
it being done in the U.S.
    Mrs. Cammack. Okay. Now, what are you doing to ensure that 
that is in fact happening? Because, as I have just laid out, we 
are finding products from all over the world, from Russia and 
China, et cetera, in our school systems.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, if you want to give us information 
about the specific schools, we will be more than happy to take 
a look at that specific circumstance. We have a process in 
which we, through our Food and Nutrition Service, do the best 
we can to ensure that the purchases are being made are 
consistent with the rules and regulations of FNS.
    Mrs. Cammack. So I will tell you what, by the end of the 
quarter, you and I can have a conversation, and I will make 
sure my team gets the data to yours, and we can go through 
that.
    [The information referred to is located on p. 173.]
    Secretary Vilsack. Right. I would be very interested in the 
names of the school districts that you have alluded to so that 
we could take a deeper dive into that particular area.
    Mrs. Cammack. Okay.
    Perfect. Now, moving on, according to FSA staff, as of 
February 9, there are currently 1,550 applications for ECP 
assistance with the USDA that are either approved and not paid, 
not approved, or still pending in the wake of Hurricanes Ian 
and Idalia. Now, you and I have chatted about this offline, but 
it has been a year and a half since Hurricane Ian and 6 months 
since Idalia. While the local FSA staff has been very helpful, 
the few that we have and we know that that is also an issue--
the ability to process these applications in the aftermath, it 
is, simply put, just inadequate, and it is unacceptable. Mr. 
Secretary, can you explain the delays in our producers getting 
the assistance when they need it the most?
    Secretary Vilsack. We are doing the very level best we can 
to get the resources out. I mean, I know that you wanted to 
ensure that the state would be allowed to do this block grant 
process. And you know what, if you authorize it, if Congress 
creates the opportunity for this, we will be more than happy to 
utilize that program. But in the meantime, we are doing the 
best we can with the resources that we have.
    Mrs. Cammack. Well, and I will say there are certain 
flexibilities and liberties that you as Secretary can take to 
make programs a little bit more flexible and get the money out 
the door faster, so I would encourage you to utilize that 
authority.
    In your written testimony, you mention that the Biden 
Administration's historic investments have allowed USDA the 
opportunity to ensure small- and mid-sized producers get a fair 
shake. Those are your words. However, other agencies in this 
Administration are proposing burdensome regulations and, if 
finalized--and some of them already have been--that will 
regulate these very producers that you are saying that you want 
to protect, it is going to regulate them out of business. Some 
examples of the regulations include Waters of the U.S., or 
WOTUS as we call it; the effluent limitation guidelines and 
standards for meat and poultry products; animal waste air 
emissions reporting; the politicization of crop protection 
tools; the SEC climate disclosure rule, just a few. Heck, I had 
the Administrator of the EPA tell me to my face point blank 
that he had no idea what contour terracing was or vegetative 
filter strips were. And yet his agency is mandating them for 
the producers that we are here to try to protect and support.
    So, Mr. Secretary, from my vantage point it appears as 
though other agencies in this Administration are playing in 
USDA's sandbox, and they are wanting to dictate what producers 
grow and how they do it. So instead of advocating for farmers 
and ranchers as intended, USDA is laser-focused on expanding 
and funding policies related to what they believe to be 
climate-smart. Now, you have testified multiple times, 
including before this very Committee, that you don't want other 
agencies to tell you how to do your job. Yet at every other 
opportunity, other agencies are telling our farmers and 
ranchers how to do theirs.
    So you end your written testimony asking if we are okay 
losing another 400,000 family farms in the next 30 years. 
However, over-regulation by the other agencies in this 
Administration outside of USDA, they are on the path to do 
exactly what your testimony is outlining. So instead of idly 
standing by, I would encourage and implore you to take a very 
active role within this Administration of which you serve to 
advocate for farmers and ranchers not only in your Department, 
but across the other agencies that are pushing our producers 
out of business.
    With that, Mr. Chairman, I am over my time. I yield back.
    The Chairman. The gentlelady's time has expired. Seeing no 
other questions to be asked by Members, before we adjourn 
today, I want to offer my closing comments. Ranking Member 
Scott had an unavoidable conflict and was not able to be here 
for his closing comments.
    First, Mr. Secretary, I want to thank you for joining us 
today. Quite frankly, your mastery of the tremendous width and 
breadth of the issues of agriculture, which is the industry 
itself, it is so complex. There is so much there. And I know 
you are to be commended and appreciated for your mastery of 
that information. I think we share the same goal, that, at the 
end of the day, we want a highly effective farm bill. I think 
the case has been made for that. You have made the case for 
that. Every Member on this Committee I talk with makes the case 
for that.
    And I think we have worked together to achieve from a 
policy perspective that end goal. Where we disagree perhaps is, 
quite frankly, we have to find a way to pay for it. And so it 
is kind of a pipedream to--and it would be a shame, the good 
bipartisan work that we have done. I want to thank our Members 
for participation--we had almost everyone--and thank our staffs 
for doing such a great job of putting this together.
    I do question whoever is in charge of the heat in the room, 
I don't know about you, but I am about frostbitten here.
    So as I close, there are a few points I want to make. I 
heard a number of times about, quote, ``the inability to pass a 
farm bill.'' And I just have to say agriculture policy, the 
agriculture industry takes teamwork, and we all need to be 
working as a team. And, quite frankly, there are probably a lot 
of reasons why we haven't got a farm bill done, let alone the 
fact that this farm bill needs to pass--has to be--the Senate 
has to take action and reconcile. That is hanging out there, 
and I don't know how soon they are going to be ready.
    But, that said, we are still waiting on USDA technical 
assistance. We have at least a dozen requests that have been 
submitted at least 6 months ago. We are still waiting. And we 
have gotten great technical assistance, but they are still 
pending from USDA, and we need to have that technical 
assistance to make sure that we are on track with great policy, 
highly effective policy. CBO has come along, but they still 
have their work that they need to complete. And by law, we 
can't really proceed without them.
    And then, quite frankly, we have a syndrome that is going 
on in this Committee and I would say in the Executive Branch, 
we have funding denial. And I will come back to that. For the 
record, this Committee has not been idle. Each Member here has 
been invited to the countryside to hear from the very people 
that we are charged to represent. And I have been very 
appreciative and thankful for the bipartisan participation that 
we have done over the past 3 years, thousands of miles, 
meetings, roundtables, visits, as was illustrated today, on-
farm, seeing agriculture in action. And that is how you build a 
great farm bill. You make it tri-partisan. It is Democrats, 
Republicans, and quite frankly, the industry, and those are the 
voices that we have brought to the table. We have actively 
engaged our Members in a bipartisan way, have actively engaged 
in roundtables and discussions to build a bipartisan product 
when it comes to policy.
    We have also heard today a lot of cherry-pick data points, 
and there is a lot of data out there to pick from, I get that, 
but attempts to paint the farm economy as positive, the 
Department's own analysis shows a very different story. And 
when you spend time with as many different farmers and 
ranchers, key stakeholders in rural America, it is a different 
story today. They are struggling.
    I have also gathered that this Administration continues to 
demonize farmers, frankly, of all sizes in cases where they do 
not subscribe to a far-left climate agenda. Now, I think 
hopefully everybody in this room and most people watching know 
that, I appreciate the fact that our farmers and ranchers, 
quite frankly, are climate champions. We don't give them credit 
for what they do already. And I am all in favor of--and knowing 
that American agriculture can be defined as science, 
technology, and innovation. It is not static. It is dynamic, 
and we will move it forward. And we will move forward with this 
farm bill.
    But the fact is that, to do that, there are good ways to do 
that and there are ways that really aren't helping the American 
farmer. Instead, this Administration is embracing continued 
inflation, record costs for production. And I appreciate that 
some of the things we have talked about have come down a little 
bit, but they are not down to where they were to that in past 
years and really what leads to the destruction of the 
agriculture landscape. I guess that is a complex way of saying 
the loss of those family farms that we have all noted that have 
gone out of business and the threats to lose more in the 
future.
    I also heard that a historically uneventful market basket 
update has been proudly manipulated to solely allow Democrats 
to increase the welfare state. And the recently submitted chart 
for the record from my colleague is disingenuous. Using a 
distortion of CBO's data really is partisanship at best. For 
those who will take the time--and it is not like there hasn't 
been ample opportunity to read the proposal--by the way, the 
only credible proposals put forward for funding this farm bill, 
which includes being prescriptive, providing Article 1 
authority in terms of--and not in an abusive way of how a 
future Thrifty Food Plan is evaluated.
    I heard so many times the word cuts when it comes to that 
proposal for being prescriptive for the Thrifty Food Plan. What 
is disingenuous is the leading factor in terms of hunger for 
many families that are struggling really in poverty is the cost 
of living, the impact of inflation, and just other factors, 
supply chain disruptions, things that would drive up the cost 
of living. Cost-of-living adjustments is not being taken away 
in this proposal. That is the primary driver of increased costs 
and financial burden on these families. It is disingenuous. And 
that is being nice. I can think of a few other words of saying 
that our proposal makes cuts.
    And a lot of talk about USDA's climate-smart pilot, which, 
quite frankly, would be better done not by using CCC, which 
should be there to directly help our farmers who are challenged 
financially, I would say that fits much better under what has 
been rolled out by USDA under ``research.'' And I am pretty 
confident there is a bipartisan consensus, we need to invest 
more in research. I mean, we are still way ahead of our 
competitors around the world, but they are spending more on an 
annual basis, and they will soon catch us. And that is not 
where we want to be with American agriculture. So I would say a 
better route would have been to work with us through the 
Research Title.
    Quite frankly, it is a unilateral insertion of USDA into 
the private marketplace, costing billions in taxpayer dollars 
with zero metrics for success and zero transparency and a self-
imposed fiscal cliff. And that includes the IRA monies, 2031, 
whatever is not spent, we hope it is all spent in an 
accountable way as an investment, not just to get it out the 
door. All those remaining dollars go away. The proposal we put 
on the table means that by rolling it into the farm bill base, 
that money for conservation would be there for farm bills in 
2050 and 2055. It would continue to grow and increase 
investments.
    I am also frustrated by the fact of the lack of an answer, 
but we will follow up personally with you on this. When asked 
about the SUSTAINS Act, you talked about the interest. Well, we 
know there is interest because that is how we built that piece 
of legislation that President Biden signed, and that was 14 
months ago. And if we are really serious about getting 
investments into conservation, then we will want to bring the 
private-sector to the table and I think will come in a big way. 
But that is not going to happen until the regulations for 
implementation are written. And in 14 months, at a time where 
we all know that conservation is so important, it is too long.
    To my friends on the other side of the aisle, 
unfortunately, your leadership has been hesitant to share with 
you how my proposed funding framework will actually help meet 
your priorities. For example, your number one priority is to 
reduce hunger. I agree that is incredibly important. And the 
proposal, which I freely admit is a budget gimmick--I don't 
understand how CBO gets $30 billion out of this--but it allows 
us to provide SNAP to populations--we could actually expand 
SNAP to populations that for decades have had limited or no 
access to SNAP. So we actually can increase access to people 
that have not been eligible for it. And, quite frankly, we 
maintain it once again, the cost-of-living adjustments, which 
means we are not cutting benefits. There is no intent to cut 
benefits. I think that is exactly what reducing hunger means, 
that expansion, and to do that and to be able to have that kind 
of a pay-for.
    And also what seems to not be translating is that if we put 
this in place, the next Administration--and there will be at 
some point a future Administration that may be more inclined. I 
hope not because I am a big supporter, as you know, of the 
Nutrition Title--that may be inclined to decimate individual 
SNAP benefits. Our proposal for funding would prevent that from 
occurring because it would be prescriptive, staying within the 
lines.
    Now, we have almost unanimous support for the doubling of 
MAP and FMD, market access for our constituents directed by 
Congress instead of at the whims of any Administration. All 
Members appreciate the depth and breadth of conservation 
programs, and we will reinvest the IRA to continue the great 
work of our original conservationist, the farmer. But we want 
to do that for more than a 10 year window. Research and 
scholarships are given--scholars will be made available to 
ensure our institutions have the tools to thrive.
    So the list goes on and on. I would like to insert into the 
record a list of Democratic priorities I have here somewhere--
here it is--sent to me by the New Dem Coalition. It is just one 
example of the litany of requests that we are trying to 
accommodate. This is a list of 125 bills or priorities, and it 
does carry a significant price tag, billions of dollars. And it 
will require the ability to move mandatory dollars into our 
current baseline.\6\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    So which is it? For all my colleagues, do you want your 
priorities funded or not? We need to be at the table not just 
on building great policy, which I think we have done over the 
past number of years. We have to be at the table figuring out 
how we fund those because without the funding, they are not 
going to be a reality.
    The funding framework I proposed is very thoughtful, 
balanced, and will not disrupt existing programs or benefits. I 
would argue in the long run they are actually going to be 
beneficial for expanding the benefits that we see under these 
programs. And the leadership, each and every person in your 
leadership, says that these will not work--well, your 
leadership says that these will not work, so, quite frankly, 
send me your realistic pay-fors because blaming the Speaker 
does not offer a real solution for our farmers, small or large, 
or rural America.

    Myth: Republicans are cutting SNAP.
    Fact: In 2021, the Biden Administration completed an unchecked 
update to the Thrifty Food Plan--which added $256 billion to the farm 
bill baseline--now presents an opportunity for Congress to revisit its 
initial intent as seen in the 2018 Farm Bill, and garner savings on the 
official scorecard. To be clear, the Republican proposal does not cut, 
decrease, or impact SNAP benefits.
    Background: Section 4002 of the 2018 Farm Bill directed USDA to 
update the Thrifty Food Plan--the market basket utilized to calculate 
SNAP benefits--every 5 years. Although CBO projected that provision to 
be cost neutral-based on more than 4 decades of precedent--the Biden 
Administration manipulated the methodology and avoided commonsense 
procedures, adding \1/4\ of $1 trillion to the SNAP baseline. Putting 
modest guardrails on future updates of the TFP, while leaving the 
annual cost-of-living adjustment in place, not only creates savings on 
the CBO scorecard, but prevents any future Administration from 
utilizing the TFP process to decimate benefits.
Does this look like a cut?

Farm Bill Endorsements
    The House Agriculture Committee has a long tradition of bipartisan 
cooperation, which is the key ingredient to passing a farm bill into 
law. We are pleased that the Committee is working to advance the goal 
of a farm bill that supports agricultural producers, invests in rural 
communities, supports American nutritional needs, and boosts American 
agricultural competitiveness. The New Democrat Coalition's Farm Bill 
Task Force \1\ will continue to collaborate with the Agriculture 
Committee, House Leadership, and other stakeholders to produce a strong 
and bipartisan package that meets the needs of American agricultural 
producers and consumers. Building off of our five core policy 
priorities \2\ for a farm bill, the New Dems will work to ensure that a 
final farm bill includes the following endorsed legislation led or co-
led by New Dem Members:

of a bipartisan farm bill that can pass into law. It is imperative that 
Americans not lose access to critical supports that keep them and their

    Finally, we ask the Committee to oppose efforts to cut funding, or

to recognize the high demand for these programs among producers--and 
the critical work our farmers, ranchers, and landowners are doing to

Executive Summary
    This report provides a high-level overview of issues surrounding 
California's Proposition 12. A challenge to the proposition reached the 
U.S. Supreme Court, where the Court issued a decision on May 12, 2023, 
that upheld the California law. As of Jan. 1, 2024, all breeding swine 
farms will need formal Proposition 12 certification for wholesale 
buyers and distributors to sell pork into the California market. Pork 
products already in storage can be distributed until December 31, 2023, 
although any pork produced after July 1, 2023 must be compliant. Among 
other things, the proposition imposes new space requirements for 
breeding sows. All covered pork products sold in California, with few 
exceptions, must be sourced from the offspring of sows that have been 
provided at least 24 square feet of usable floor space for each sow, 
regardless of where the hogs are produced. Because California produces 
only a small amount of the pork sold there, the proposition will impose 
space requirements on hog producers across the nation. The costs of 
these restrictions are widespread and extensive. Farmers face the costs 
of renovation or the construction of new facilities. These costs are 
made more significant by recent extreme increases in building costs. 
Farmers will also face losses in productivity as they move to new 
production and management systems. This lost productivity will be 
especially acute in the short run, as the new systems are mastered. The 
new production systems will lead to increased stress on breeding sows, 
which in turn will lead to lower fertility and embryo survival rates. 
The industry must maintain identity preservation and market 
segmentations. This will involve considerable changes in the logistics 
of pork product distribution. For many reasons, these costs will have a 
more severe impact on smaller, independent operations. These operations 
tend to be less efficient and have lower profit margins. Smaller 
operations also have less access to the credit needed to finance 
renovations and new construction. Thus, one important outcome of 
Proposition 12 will be an increase in the exit of smaller hog 
operations. The pork industry will become more concentrated with fewer 
but bigger farm operations. The stresses placed upon the entire 
production and marketing chain will also favor larger processors, 
thereby leading to ever-increasing consolidation and concentration of 
the industry. To the extent that certain segments of the consuming 
market are willing to pay a premium for pork raised in accordance with 
Proposition 12, producers choosing to adopt the required production 
measures may realize new market opportunities through premiums for 
compliant production. However, the free market will address these 
issues without the mandates and costs imposed by Proposition 12, and 
thus an optimal solution would have been to allow the marketplace to 
allocate products that are differentiated by production practices.

Concluding Remarks
California's Proposition 12 and its Impacts on the Pork Industry
    Proposition 12, the ``Prevention of Cruelty to Farm Animals'' Act, 
was approved by California voters in 2018 and its provisions for hogs 
will become effective on January 1, 2024. Implementation and 
enforcement of the law was complicated by delays in the release of 
final regulations describing details of the regulations and a 
``prohibitory writ of mandate'' that temporarily stayed public and 
private enforcement of the Act. On May 11, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court 
issued a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit in which they supported the defendants and upheld the 
proposition.\2\ The case, brought by the National Pork Producers 
Council NPPC) and the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF), argued 
that Proposition 12 violated the ``Dormant Commerce'' clause of the 
Constitution that prohibits legislation that discriminates or 
excessively burdens interstate commerce.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ National Pork Producers Council et al. v. Ross et al., Case No. 
20-55631 (9th Circuit Court of Appeals, 2021). The petitioners argued 
that the proposition had the ``practical effect of controlling commerce 
outside the State,'' even when those laws do not purposely discriminate 
against out-of-state interests.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Act proposes to ``prevent animal cruelty by phasing out extreme 
methods of farm animal confinement, which also threaten the health and 
safety of California consumers and increase the risk of food-borne 
illness and associated negative fiscal impacts on the State of 
California.'' The new regulations mandate that all pork sold in 
California, with limited exceptions, must be sourced from the offspring 
of sows that have been provided at least 24 square feet of usable floor 
space for each smv. Enclosures must be sufficiently large enough to 
allow sows to turn around without touching the sides of the enclosure. 
The regulations apply to any breeding pigs over 6 months of age and to 
all whole pork meat marketed in the state, regardless of where it was 
produced. The regulations exclude comminuted products containing more 
than just pork and pork used in processed food products.
    The next steps for industry and for legislative actions involving 
animal welfare are unclear. Many legislative options are focused on 
preventing a 50 state patchwork of conflicting state welfare laws. As I 
discuss in this paper, the proposition will certainly bring about 
significant changes to the structure of the pork industry. The 
proposition will likely lead to renovation of existing hog farm 
facilities and new construction of facilities that are compliant with 
the proposition. The pork industry will need to segregate pork products 
on the basis of compliance with the proposition. This segregation will 
lead to increased marketing costs and will complicate the logistics of 
pork marketing practices.
    A limited number of exemptions apply to Proposition 12. The 
restrictions do not apply for animals involved in transportation, 
research, during individual treatments, and at slaughter. The space 
requirements are also waived for 5 days prior to the expected farrowing 
date, while sows are nursing, and temporarily during breeding 
activities. It is also waived for hogs being treated by a licensed 
veterinarian. These exemptions are limited to a maximum of 6 hours per 
day, not to exceed 24 total hours over a 30 day period.
    The limited nature of these exemptions has important implications 
for breeding, farrowing, and nursing efficiency. These restrictions 
will likely decrease the effectiveness of insemination services and 
will likely diminish the overall health of recently farrowed piglets. 
In a presumed effort to improve the welfare of sows, animals will be 
intermingled to a much greater degree than is currently the practice. 
As is true of most livestock animals, efforts to establish social 
dominance when put into groups will lead to increased morbidity and 
mortality, something even the state of California admits. Producers 
that have adopted production practices consistent with the proposition 
have already realized lower conception rates, lower farrowing rates, 
and increased non-productive sow days. These effects have been 
demonstrated in the research findings of animal scientists as well as 
in the experiences of those farms with Proposition 12 compliant 
facilities.\3\ As is often the case with such mandates, efforts to 
promote the health and welfare of gestating sows appear to have the 
opposite effect.

    At present, California has a population of 39.2 million people, or 
about 12% of the U.S. population. In December of 2021, California had a 
hog inventory of about 85,000 head. In comparison, the U.S. had a hog 
inventory of 74.9 million head, implying that California only has about 
0.11% of the nation's total hog and pig inventory.\4\ Figure 1 
illustrates the numbers of hog producing operations across the U.S. The 
relative lack of hog production in California is notable. California 
represents a growing market, with its population expanding by 5.1% 
between 2010 and 2021.

    The consumption of pork products is not homogeneous across 
different ethnic groups. Figure 2 illustrates total expenditures on 
pork products by different demographic groups in the U.S. Consumption 
is especially high for Hispanic and Asian ethnic groups. California's 
population is diverse and ever evolving, with Hispanics or Latinos 
accounting for 40.2% of the population and Asians accounting for 15.3% 
of the population.\5\ These factors reinforce the importance of 
California as a destination market for pork products produced across 
the U.S. Nearly all pork consumed in California is produced outside of 
the state.

    As of February 2021, it was estimated that only about 4% of 
existing U.S. hog farm facilities conformed to the Proposition 12 space 
requirements, although the proposition has spurred the building and 
renovation of compliant facilities.\6\ The industry standard sow 
housing stalls currently average 14-20 square feet. Proposition 12 will 
bring about significant disruptions and adjustments in the U.S. pork 
industry and will require extensive renovation or new construction to 
provide facilities that conform to the proposition's requirements.

Producers Await Legal Ruling,'' Rabobank Research, February 2021.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Proposition 12 also has important implications for international 
commerce. The U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF) has noted that 
Proposition 12 presents significant logistical challenges for pork 
exporters using California's port infrastructure and cold storage 
facilities. The USMEF noted that in 2020, 2.977 million metric tons of 
pork, valued at $7.72 billion, and representing 29% of total U.S. pork 
production was exported, with almost 50% of exports transiting through 
California ports.\7\ The Canadian Pork Board filed an amicus curiae 
brief with the U.S. Supreme Court on October 21, 2021, arguing that 
Proposition 12 has disruptive effects on international commerce and 
violates the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement (USMCA) as well as 
provisions of the WTO.\8\

that, in 2020, Canada exported more than 300,000 metric tons of pork to 
the U.S.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In addition to the Supreme Court case, the North American Meat 
Institute (NAMI) filed a petition challenging the constitutionality of 
the proposition.\9\ These challenges were in part also based upon 
presumed violations of the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, 
where it was argued that California's regulations have a negative 
impact on the interstate commerce of other states. The regulations will 
also create obstructions to competition from pork producers outside of 
California. The petition was supported by 20 states, who filed amicus 
curiae briefs in support of the litigation. On February 26, 2021, NAMI 
unsuccessfully filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn 
Proposition 12.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    California's Proposition 2, which expanded space requirements for 
egg-laying hens, withstood similar legal challenges. As Proposition 2 
demonstrated, these propositions most certainly have impacts on 
interstate trade and the methods of production in other states. The 
prominence of cage-free egg production rose substantially across the 
U.S. as egg producers undertook structural changes to accommodate the 
space requirements.
    The objective of this article is to review the impacts and to 
estimate the costs associated with implementation of Proposition 12. 
Many of these costs, such as the costs associated with renovation of 
existing facilities and construction of new facilities, are apparent. 
However, other costs that. will affect the pork industry are less 
obvious. For example, I note the potential impacts that. the new space 
requirements will have on the efficiency of breeding and the physical 
well-being of sows. Many of these costs have been considered in 
existing evaluations of Proposition 12.
    However, other subtle cost changes have received less attention in 
the existing studies of Proposition 12. To the extent that the 
Proposition creates a bifurcation of the market with pork products 
segmented into those that are compliant and those that are not, the 
entire marketing chain from processors to retailers will be tasked with 
preserving the identity of pork products and effectively segmenting the 
market to identify those products that are compliant from those that 
are not.\10\ Past efforts at preserving the identity of differentiated 
basic commodities such as corn and rice have proven to be both 
expensive and difficult to maintain. These costs have both short-term 
and long-term implications. A likely outcome in the long run will be 
widespread adoption of production practices that conform to Proposition 
12. Because such changes necessarily apply to long-lived assets in the 
form of production facilities, full adjustment of the industry to 
Proposition 12 is likely to take several years.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \10\ As one anonymous industry representative noted, this will 
require doubling the number of stock-keeping units (SKUs) that the 
industry will have to manage throughout the marketing chain.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Costs of Proposition 12
    Proposition 12 will bring about fundamental changes in the 
structure of the U.S. pork industry. Consumers in some states, with 
California being a leading example, are becoming increasingly sensitive 
to animal welfare issues. This has been shown to be especially true 
among younger consumers, who typically express greater concerns for 
animal welfare and environmental externalities.\11\ However, consumers 
may not fully comprehend the nature and finer points of livestock 
production systems or the likely impacts of legislated actions meant to 
improve animal welfare.\12\ As existing facilities are replaced as a 
normal course of business, it is likely that new designs that conform 
to the types of animal welfare considerations reflected in Proposition 
12 will be implemented, even if such facilities are significantly more 
expensive.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \11\ For example, researchers in Norway found that young consumers 
tended to be significantly more concernedwith sustainability and animal 
welfare (Norwegianscitechnews.com, 11-2022).
    \12\ Proposition 12 also imposes space requirements for veal calves 
(43 square feet) and egg-laying hens (1 square foot). The support of 
consumers for any specific restriction, such as that applying solely to 
hogs, is unclear and it is possible that consumer concerns about 
specific production practices may be dominated by only certain types of 
animals, such as veal calves and hens.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A major source of the costs of adjustment to such regulatory 
changes relates to the uncertainty that these changes introduce to the 
industry. California's animal welfare regulations have been upheld, but 
the legislative actions of other states as well as those of the U.S. 
Congress remain unclear. Uncertainty, by its very nature, introduces 
tangible costs to any business operation. Alongside efforts to have the 
restrictions overturned were several attempts to delay implementation 
of the space requirements. The conditions imposed by Proposition 12 
will be fully enforced beginning in January of 2024, though any pork 
produced after July 1 must meet the conditions of the proposition. Many 
farmers and much of the industry were hesitant to commit to such 
fundamental changes if the likelihood and timing of the space 
requirements were unclear. However, this uncertainty has been resolved 
and many producers are already renovating existing facilities and 
constructing new hog barns in order to conform to the proposition. The 
implications for market demand and supply in the future are largely 
unknown. This uncertainty includes consumer preferences for Proposition 
12 compliant pork products. The additional willingness to pay for 
compliant products is unknown and the overall impact on pork supply 
likewise remains unclear.
Renovation and New Construction Costs
    Renovation and new construction represent major irreversible 
commitments requiring very significant investments. These costs are 
exacerbated by the very active and volatile nature of construction 
industries in the U.S. Building material costs increased significantly 
as the U.S. economy emerged from pandemic quarantines. A February 22, 
2022, Fortune article noted that lumber prices experienced a 227% 
increase between August 2021 and February 2022, though prices have 
returned to long-run normal levels since.\13\ Building materials have 
realized considerably volatility in recent years. Crude oil, which is 
an important ingredient in many construction materials, has risen by 
over 250% since mid-2020. Figure 3 contains an illustration of real 
prices of important building materials.\14\ The extreme volatility of 
prices for building materials is apparent. Huge swings in lumber prices 
were experienced, suggesting the possibility of the bubble noted by the 
Fortune author. Asphalt prices, which are important in the construction 
of roofing materials and paved surfaces, reflect the tremendous 
increases in oil prices. Nearly all the relevant building materials are 
at exaggerated levels relative to normal long-run price levels. Lumber 
is an important exception although just a year ago lumber prices were 
several times higher than current levels.

    \14\ Building materials prices were taken from the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics' producer price indexes. The indexes were deflated using the 
consumer price index from the same source and are normalized to a value 
of 1.0 in January of 2004.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Renovation and new construction typically require long-term credit. 
Interest rates have risen significantly in recent months, adding to the 
costs of renovation or new construction in order to comply with 
Proposition 12. In August of 2023, the USDA Farm Service Agency 
interest rate for direct farm operating loans was 4.875%.\15\ In May of 
2021, this rate was 1.75%. The average bank prime loan rate rose from 
3.25% in March 2022 to its current (August 2023) level of 8.25%. For a 
$15 million loan financed for 10 years, this 5% change adds $4.48 
million to total payments. Figure 4 illustrates the average 15 year 
fixed mortgage rate for U.S. banks. Current levels surpass anything 
realized in recent history.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \15\ It should be noted that these USDA guaranteed loans have a 
limit of $400,000, which is a small proportion of the total costs of 
constructing a new hog barn.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    An important but less obvious cost associated with renovating or 
constructing hog facilities arises from the irreversible nature of 
construction. That is, in addition to the obvious cost of materials, 
any new construction imposes a loss of option value for the investor. 
If the restrictions associated with Proposition 12 are changed at some 
future date, it is possible that facilities that were made to be 
compatible with Proposition 12 may not satisfy the new 
requirements.\16\ Further to this same point, because the imposition of 
restrictions always has negative impacts on efficiency, relaxing of the 
restrictions may leave producers that did invest in new facilities at a 
competitive disadvantage.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \16\ For example, Rule 901:12-9-02 of the Ohio Administrative Code 
requires group housing for all pregnant sows by 2025 but allows for 
breeding sow placement in individual stalls until pregnancy is 
confirmed. Farmers have transitioned to the new standards in facility 
design, but their new facilities will not satisfy the requirements of 
Proposition 12.
    \17\ An important engineering result--the Le Chatelier Principle--
holds that the imposition of restrictions on a profit-maximizing 
producer will always lead to lower profits (or at least no higher 
profits).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I surveyed industry experts, academic research, and discussed costs 
with several producers that had already converted their facilities to 
be compliant with Proposition 12. It is important to recognize that the 
costs of new construction and conversion of existing facilities vary 
widely according to individual circumstances. Although the costs are 
largely consistent across the alternative sources discussed below, each 
case had its own unique conditions.
    According to Hog Slat, Inc., as of August 2023, a newly constructed 
shallow pit design farm that is Proposition 12 compliant would cost 
$2,100-$2,800 per sow.\18\ An equivalent deep pit design would cost 
approximately $2,600-$3,200 per sow. These cost figures do not include 
excavation, utilities, roads, or wells. The costs of renovating an 
existing farm to be compliant using only the existing barn space would 
be $170-$750. This does not include the loss in throughput that such a 
conversion would entail. Going from 18 ft\2\ to 24 ft\2\, for example, 
necessarily results in a loss of throughput of about 25-30%.\19\ If a 
farmer instead decides to add additional barn space to keep throughput 
constant, the costs will be about $450-$850 for a shallow pit design 
and $650-$1,050 for a deep pit design. There is significant variation 
in what is being done by individual growers. Likewise, the starting 
point in terms of equipment vintage and condition means that the costs 
of conversion will differ significantly across farms.\20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \18\ Hog Slat, Inc. is a major producer and construction 
coordinator for hog barns and associated facilities. Costs were 
supplied by Mr. David Herring, who is Vice President and founder of the 
firm.
    \19\ Crate sizes vary across different facility arrangements, but a 
typical arrangement is 2 ft. by 7 ft. or 14 sq. ft. At a sow price of 
$48/cwt. (October 2, 2023), a 5,000 sow operation would suffer $324,000 
in lost throughput per cycle.
    \20\ Mr. Herring noted that renovation and conversion could range 
in comparison terms from a ``Geo to a Cadillac.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Renovation may be more costly than new construction due to 
demolition, removal, and disposal costs and depending on the age and 
condition of the facilities. Other estimates put the cost of new 
gestation space at about $2,150 per space for Proposition 12 compliant 
facilities as compared to $1,500 for standard gestation stalls--a 43% 
difference in cost.\21\ Construction of a new facility covering the 
farrow to wean period of production has been estimated to be about 
$3,600 to $4,000 per sow. About 75% of that cost is associated with the 
facility while 25% applies to land and infrastructure. Facilities that 
are compliant with Proposition 12 are estimated to cost about 22% more 
than conventional facilities. These costs vary substantially according 
to the size of the operation. The above estimates apply to an operation 
size of 5,200 sows. However, smaller operations will pay considerably 
more per animal. A farm of 1,000 animals will have costs that are about 
15% higher per animal. These costs are about 10% higher for a farm of 
2,600 sows. This suggests that construction of a new deep pit design 
facility that will allow 5,200 hogs to have the space requirements 
mandated by Proposition 12 will cost about $16.6 million, not including 
land and infrastructure (Herring, 2023 and the author's calculations).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \21\ Cost estimates taken from Compeer Financial presentation, 
``Financial Cost of Proposition 12,'' October 25, 2021, and from

Hog Slat Incorporated, on August 16, 2023.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Producer Experiences
    To gain more specific information regarding compliant new 
construction and renovation, I spoke with four producers that had 
adopted Proposition 12 compliant production practices through 
construction of new facilities and/or renovation of existing 
facilities.\22\ Specific names and details of those interviewed are 
withheld to maintain the anonymity of individuals.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \22\ Discussions with producers took place in August 2023.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Producer A (Ohio)
    Producer A is in the process of breaking ground on a Proposition 12 
compliant hog operation. This producer will operate two adjacent 2,500 
hog farms, for a total of 5,000 sows. The budgeted amount and expected 
cost for this new construction is $10 million. This does not include 
any land or excavation costs. They initially considered renovation with 
space being added to maintain throughput. This would have cost $3.3 
million, or about $665 per sow. An important consideration in any 
decision of whether to convert is the premiums that a processor might 
offer for pork that is certified to be ``Proposition 12 Compliant.'' 
The costs of conversion must be weighed against the premiums, if any, 
that compliant pork products will earn. This producer reported a wide 
range of premiums that largely varied with the length of the production 
contract.\23\ Premiums for compliant hogs typically ranged from $6-$10 
per head. This producer had heard of premiums as low as $4 per head and 
as high as $15 per head.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \23\ Nearly all hogs in the U.S. are produced and marketed under 
contracts with processors.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Producer B (Iowa)
    This producer is tearing down an existing facility and building a 
new facility. A new gestation barn would cost about $1,700 per sow for 
standard technologies and $2,300 per sow for compliant facilities, 
though it was noted that a standard cost for new construction was 
$4,000 per sow. Remodeling could have been accomplished for $1,000 to 
$1,200 per sow if no additional space were to be added. This also 
results in a 30% reduction in throughput, which must be added to the 
cost of conversion. If new space was added to maintain the same level 
of throughput, the cost would be about $1,550 to $1,700 per sow. If 
productive assets are liquidated to make room for new technologies, the 
opportunity cost of lost production must also be considered. Put 
differently, a grower that foregoes conversion does not bear the cost 
of conversion but also is able to continue to produce using current 
assets.
Producer C (Indiana)
    This producer was an early adopter of Proposition 12 compliant 
technologies. They converted their facilities in January of 2022. Their 
farm houses 10,000 sows. Their facilities were converted to be 
compliant, and they did not have any new construction. They estimated 
the costs to be about $3,000 per sow for new construction at the time 
that they undertook facility conversions. Their facilities already had 
loose sow housing systems, and in that case, the cost of conversion was 
only $150 per sow, again demonstrating that the costs of converting 
existing facilities to be compliant with the proposition depends 
significantly on the starting point for any such conversions. They also 
noted the value of manure as fertilizer on their farm. Any temporary or 
permanent decrease in the size of the operation would cause a modest 
loss of revenue from the value of manure. At the margin, they realized 
about $80,000 from manure sales each year on their 10,000 sow farm. 
This producer expressed strong concerns that the proposition should not 
be viewed as a change that results in an overall decrease in the health 
of sows. As I discuss in detail below, the group housing that 
Proposition 12 will bring about often raises concerns about morbidity, 
mortality, and decreased farrowing due to sow aggression in group pens. 
This grower was adamant that any direct link between sow health and the 
proposition should be interpreted with caution.
Producer D (Pennsylvania)
    This producer manages a very large scale of production--about 
40,000 sows--that has been converted to Proposition 12 compliant 
technologies. They offered very precise estimates of the costs of 
conversion of existing facilities, noting that the cost depends on the 
starting point prior to conversion. If converting at the pre-implant 
stage of production in crates that already meet the 24 sq. ft. 
requirement, the costs were $81.19 per sow (on 24,126 sows where 
conversion cost $1,958,890). For facilities at the pre-implant stage of 
production with existing stalls of 21 sq. ft., the cost of conversion 
was $207.71 per sow (for 17,760 sows with a total cost of $3,689,000). 
For forms at the pre-implant and post-implant stages of production; 
which accounted for 11,200 sows and with 20.5 sq. ft., the cost was 
$2,500,000, or $223.21 per sow. This farmer did not have to convert any 
fully crated farms but they were quoted $1,000 per sow for such 
conversions. All such costs significantly depend upon the starting 
point and the amount of preparation work required. For new facilities, 
this producer estimated cost of $3,500-$4,000 per sow, depending upon 
excavation and permitting cost.
Summary of Producer Opinions
    Several points emerge from the preceding discussions with growers 
that have already changed their operations to be compliant with 
Proposition 12 or that are in the process of making the conversion. The 
first is that there is a very wide range of costs associated with 
making production changes to make an operation's hog output compliant 
with the proposition. The costs of building a new gestation barn with 
technologies that are compliant generally ranged from $3,600-$4,000 per 
sow, although such costs do not include demolition, roads, wells, 
utilities, land, excavation, and permitting costs. These costs are 
likely to vary widely according to location and the existing 
facilities, if any. In addition, construction costs have risen 
significantly since these producers undertook construction and 
renovation. If we assume a conservative 12.5% increase in the costs of 
materials and labor for new construction, a facility that is fully 
Proposition 12 compliant would cost about $4,500 per sow.\24\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \24\ The final demand construction producer price index rose by 
about 15% between January 2022 and August 2023.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Renovation of existing facilities is also costly and, in some 
cases, may cost more than building new facilities. Remodeling an 
existing farm to be compliant with the proposition generally costs a 
grower about $1,000 per sow, though depending on existing facilities, 
the costs could be less than $100 per sow. However, once again, the 
costs vary widely according to the existing facilities, especially the 
size of existing crates. If a farm is at the standard size of sow 
crates (14-21 sq. ft.) and if no new construction occurs, the farm will 
realize a reduction in throughput of about 30%. For example; a 2,500 
hog farm of the typical size would have to reduce its throughput to 
about 1,665 because of the lost floor space.
    To put these costs into context, consider construction of a 5,000 
sow farm, which is a common size for a commercial hog farm. According 
to the preceding discussions; this would cost about $18-$20 million. At 
current interest rates (assume 6%) and if the farm's facilities have a 
lifetime of 10 years (and an accompanying loan with a 10 year term), 
the farm would have a loan payment of $222,000 per month and would pay 
$26.64 million over the life of the loan. In comparison, a conventional 
farm with non-compliant facilities would cost about $3,000 per sow. 
Under the same loan terms, the farm would have a monthly payment of 
$166,531 and the farmer would pay $19.9 million over the life of the 
loan. The differences are substantial and illustrate the impact of high 
interest rates.
Costs and Farm Size
    The differences in construction costs across different sized hog 
farms have important implications for how the industry will be impacted 
by Proposition 12. Smaller farms will he more constrained by access to 
capital and thinner margins. Figures 5 through 7 illustrate some 
important differences in the financial situations of different sized 
hog farms.\25\ The USDA segments farms according to annual sales. The 
diagrams illustrate financial conditions for the following categories 
of total annual farm sales--less than $100,000, $100,000-$249,999, 
$250,000-$499,999, $500,000-$1 million, and over $1 million. The farms 
considered are those for which their principal designation is as a hog 
farm, meaning that the largest share of farm's value of production is 
attributable to hogs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \25\ Statistics taken from the ARMS Data Analysis Resource (https:/
/my.data.ers.usda.gov/arms/data-analysis).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The financial condition of a business operation is heavily 
influenced by the availability and cost of borrowed capital. Figure 5 
illustrates the leverage position (total debts over total assets) in 
the top panel and the rate of return to equity in the bottom panel. 
Each portion of the panels represents the development of financial 
indicators across different economic classes of farms and the green bar 
represents the average value over the 1995-2019 period. The first block 
applies to all farms and then moving left to right, across increasingly 
larger (by sales) classes of farms.
    Hog operations tend to be much more highly leveraged than is the 
case for other types of farms. According to the Economic Research 
Service of the USDA, the debt to assets ratio for all U.S. farms 
averaged about 8.2% in 2020. In contrast, the 2020 debt to asset ratio 
for farms specializing in hog production is 22.5%. This demonstrates 
the fact that hog farms tend to be more dependent on borrowed capital 
than farms in general and that the leverage ratio tends to increase 
with farm size. This is not surprising in that the high debt to asset 
ratio reflects the fact that hog form facilities require a substantial 
up-front capital investment and therefore hog farms require borrowed 
capital to a greater degree than farms in general.
    The lower panel of Figure 5 contains the rate of return to equity 
for hog farms of various economic classes. The return to equity on hog 
farms tends to be progressively lower for smaller farms, as reflected 
in the value of production. This suggests that smaller farms realize a 
lower return to investments and therefore will likely realize less 
favorable terms of credit. This has important implications for the 
ability of farms to undertake the significant capital investments that 
conformity to Proposition 12 would require.
    Figure 6 presents net farm income and the farms' operating profit 
margin. Again, the financial standing of smaller farms tends to be much 
less favorable than is the case for larger farms. The drop is 
especially substantial when considering the smallest category of 
farms--those with annual sales of less than $100,000. This smallest 
category of farms tends to have net incomes that are close to zero and 
operating profit margins that are significantly negative. Again, this 
suggests that the smallest hog farms will be the least able to 
undertake the changes that would make facilities conformable to 
Proposition 12.
    Finally, we consider two measures of hog farm efficiency. The first 
is given by the ratio of net cash income to total cash expenses. The 
second focuses on feed efficiency and is given by the ratio of 
livestock sales to total feed expenditures. In both cases, the smallest 
category of farms tends to be significantly less efficient, both in 
terms of the total operation and in terms of feed efficiency. Overall 
farming efficiency tends to be moderately higher as farm size 
increases. In contrast, feed efficiency is similar across all economic 
classes of hog farms except for the smallest farms, which are 
substantially less efficient.
    The review of hog farm financial conditions provides several 
important insights that arc all consistent in the implication that 
smaller farms will be impacted much more significantly than larger hog 
farms. The statistics reveal that hog farms are much more highly 
leveraged than farms in general and therefore are more dependent on 
credit markets for their survival. Hog farms will be affected by recent 
interest rate increases much more than other types of farms. Adopting 
production processes and methods that are compatible with the 
requirements of Proposition 12 will require substantial access to 
borrowed capital. As noted above, the total investment involved in the 
construction or renovation of facilities that conform to the space 
requirements will be several million dollars, making access to credit a 
critical variable in the long-run survival of hog farms. Creditors will 
consider these financial ratios and variables when evaluating loans and 
these evaluations are likely to be especially negative for the smallest 
hog farms. These farms have the lowest relative incomes and profit 
margins. The statistics also demonstrate that the smallest farms tend 
to besignificantly less efficient: both in terms of overall returns 
over expenses and in terms of theefficiency of hog feeding.
    These economic facts have important implications for how 
California's Proposition 12 is likely to impact the U.S. hog sector. 
Concern over the economic viability of small and limited resource farms 
continues to be an important factor shaping U.S. agricultural policy. 
The sectoral changes that Proposition 12 is likely to trigger will be 
unfavorable for smaller hog farms, who will have less access to credit 
and who will be less able to undertake the investments necessary to 
bring facilities into compliance with the space requirements of the 
proposition. This will hasten the concentration of the hog farming 
industry, with smaller farms exiting the sector, leaving a U.S. hog 
industry that has fewer but larger farms. Those farms with thin 
margins, which tend to be the smallest operations, will be the first to 
exit the industry. Likewise, efficiency differences that favor larger 
operations will play a role in smaller farms being the first to exit 
the industry.
    According to the 2017 Agrcultural Census, there are 58,180 
independent hog farmers. These independent farmers had 24.9 million 
hogs in inventory. Contractors and integrators and contract growers 
numbered 8,259 and had 47.5 million hogs in inventory. Independent 
growers with more than 2,000 hogs numbered 2,462 and had 22.2 million 
hogs in inventory. In contrast, of the farms operated by contractors or 
contractees, 5,862 farms had 2,000 or more hogs in inventory and 
accounted for 29 million hogs. These statistics demonstrate that hog 
farms with production contracts tend to be larger and account for a 
larger share of hog production (inventory) than independent growers. It 
is likely that the processors/integrators will be a driving force in 
encouraging facility changes that conform to the proposition. I have 
shown that larger farms tend to be more efficient and more profitable. 
Thus, an obvious inference to emerge from this consideration of the 
2017 census statistics suggests that the proposition will likely push 
more farms to adopt production contracts. The proposition will 
therefore hasten the transition from independent to contract growers.
    Finally, a subtle cost factor that favors larger growers pertains 
to delivery practices and the associated segregation of compliant and 
non-compliant hogs. Larger growers can deliver larger loads of hogs 
that are consistent in terms of their adherence to the requirements of 
Proposition 12. A processor is better able to keep hogs segregated 
according to their compliance when a large grower delivers a 
significant volume of hogs. It may be more difficult to maintain 
segregation when a processor is accepting numerous smaller loads of 
hogs from a collection of small growers. This may influence the 
premiums paid for hogs produced in compliance with the proposition. 
Large growers may receive higher premiums because it is easier for 
processors to take delivery and maintain segregation.\26\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \26\ This point was raised by one of the large growers that I 
interviewed for this study.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reductions in Available Space and Throughput
    An obvious cost that will be borne by hog producers pertains to the 
fact that an operation of a given size will suffer a reduction in 
output when facilities are renovated to make the necessary space 
available to sows. This space must be taken from existing uses. 
According to a recent report by Rabobank, if stocking density is 
reduced to meet the proposition's space requirements, production flows 
will drop by at least 25%.\27\ This naturally implies a reduction in 
herd sizes and a flood of new construction to meet the requirements. 
According to the Rabobank report, to comply with Proposition 12, at 
least 15% of U.S. hog producers will need to convert to the new 
facility requirements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \27\ See McCracken, C. ``US Pork Supply Chain Locked in Limbo as 
Producers Await Legal Ruling,'' Rabobank Research, February 2021.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    These changes will bring about costs associated with lost stall 
space, which will reduce the overall output of facilities of a given 
size that choose to convert. Estimates made by an anonymous industry 
observer suggested that if there is no change in the size of a 
gestation barn, renovations to make the facility compliant with 
Proposition 12 will require a 25% reduction in the size of the sow 
herd, a 6% reduction in the farrowing rate, and a 0.67 pig reduction in 
pigs weaned per sow. These changes result in an additional cost of 
$17.59 per pig because of reduced pig throughput. The extent to which 
the processors and integrators agree to offer premiums for hogs grown 
under the new requirements will be a major factor in determining the 
adoption of the new production techniques.
Farm Productivity Declines
    Although the space requirements are intended to improve the welfare 
of pigs and hogs, there are many reasons to be concerned that changes 
in sow housing arrangements will bring about added stress to the 
animals. The existing science does not support the intentions of the 
regulations--hogs will be worse off under the new restrictions. Mixing 
animals together as would be common in many of the conversion 
scenarios, will induce stress as animals compete for dominance and 
feed. Animals are likely to fight, therefore causing increases in 
morbidity and mortality. This in turn will also negatively impact 
fertility and embryo survival rates. Competition for social dominance 
in the new production methods is expected to increase sow mortality by 
3-5%. The requirements of the proposition have limited exemptions for 
sows undergoing breeding and this will necessarily increase the amount 
of time that sows are housed together.
    Research indicates that conversion to Proposition 12 compliant 
production practices could bring about a drop in farming rates of 6-
10%. Feed costs will rise due to a drop in the productivity of sows. 
These costs are estimated to he $0.72 per sow per unproductive day, or 
an additional 5 pounds of feed per day for an additional 35 days. These 
changes imply an additional cost per pig of $0.13-$0.22. Changes in 
reproduction rates will decrease the number of pigs born per sow by 
0.65 pigs, representing a cost of $2.46-$3.79 per pig.
    Johnson and Li (2013) found that 97.6% of sows in stalls produced a 
litter but only 92.2% of sows in group pens farrowed a litter.\28\ 
Similarly, 90.8% of sows in stalls completed the relevant study as 
compared to only 84.2% of sows in large pens. Sows were removed from 
the study due to poor milk production and poor reproductive 
performance. Sows were also removed due to morbidity and mortality 
losses, largely due to animal aggression. Large pens that did not 
permit animals space to retreat realized the largest effects of sow 
fighting.

of Sows Housed in Pens Retrofitted from Gestation Stalls,'' Journal of 
Animal Science, 91: 5937-5945.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Although experience with these new production methods is limited, 
one can be certain that conventional housing arrangements represent the 
economic optimum, at least at the time the facilities were constructed. 
Therefore, there are reasons to conclude that productivity will suffer 
because of the proposition.
    Productivity will also suffer because new production and management 
systems take time to master. Hemsworth and Coleman (2011) found that 
the skill of stock people can affect the performance and health of 
sows.\29\ David Herring of Hog Slat, the leading facility construction 
firm, estimated that production costs could increase by 5-8% in the 
short run, until the new techniques are mastered by producers.\30\ An 
anonymous producer that had adopted the new technology noted that the 
learning period was much more expensive than they had expected and that 
there is an inherent increase in the need to manage gestation animal 
care in going to a higher percentage of sows in pens versus individual 
stalls. Producers also noted that difficulties in mastering the new 
techniques were very dependent on the quality of the hired staff.

Regulatory Overhead
    The adoption and enforcement of new regulations always involves 
additional regulatory costs. These costs will be borne by both 
producers and consumers of pork. The enforcement process remains 
unclear in many respects but is likely to involve auditors working as 
third parties or on behalf of the California Department of Food and 
Agriculture (CDFA), the regulatory agency responsible for enforcing the 
restrictions of the proposition. The CDFA and California State 
Department of Public Health have been jointly tasked with promulgating 
the rules and regulations for the implementation of the proposition. 
California's Health and Safety Code (HSC) Section 25993.1 states that a 
business owner or operator must rely in good faith upon a written 
certification by their supplier that pork was not derived from an 
animal confined in a manner inconsistent with the proposition. The 
California code provides for a $1,000 fine and 180 days of 
incarceration for a violation of the proposition.
    The current draft rule of the CDFA describes a certification 
process that will be carried out by the CDFA or by a certifying agent, 
who must be accredited by the CDFA. The regulations also require that 
each producer and handler of pork hold a valid certification and that 
any pork handler selling meat in California must be registered. The 
proposition requires that all shipping invoices, bills of lading, and 
shipping manifests for all shipments of whole pork meat entering the 
state or transported within the state for commercial sale in California 
shall include the statement ``California 24+ Compliant.'' These 
additional requirements, taken as a whole, suggest rather substantial 
increases in the cost of trading pork products.
    One can imagine that the proposition will create a new industry of 
third-party agents providing certification. This industry will 
certainly involve costs that will be borne by California pork consumers 
and producers providing pork to the California market. This regulatory 
overhead is commonly referred to as ``deadweight costs'' by economists. 
That is, costs that do not reflect benefits. From a scientific 
perspective, the welfare of hogs will not be appreciably improved by 
the restrictions and may, in fact, be diminished. California consumers 
and pork buyers elsewhere may realize some benefit from the knowledge 
that the pork that they are enjoying was derived from pigs that had 
extra space. However, as previously noted, the restrictions also apply 
to egg-laying hens and veal calves and the precise motives underlying 
voters' intentions are unclear. Of course, third-party certification 
agents will benefit from the new demand for their services.
    These costs will be shared by pork consumers, retailers, 
processors, and producers. It has been noted that a bifurcation of the 
market whereby pork commands a premium in California but is made 
cheaper outside of the state is likely to emerge in the short run. A 
considerable volume of pork that is currently shipped to California 
will instead be channeled to consumers in other states, thereby 
lowering the price outside of California. Likewise, considering the 
considerable volume of pork that is exported from the U.S., import 
markets may also realize lower prices.\31\ High market segmentation 
costs (discussed next) will likely encourage widespread adoption of the 
standards as it may be cheaper overall to adopt the new standards for 
all pork than to maintain separate markets for certified and non-
certified pork.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \31\ The USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) estimates that 
26% of the projected U.S. production of 12.8 million tons will be 
exported in 2021. See ``Livestock and Poultry: World Markets and 
Trade,'' USDA-FAS, April 9, 2021.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The difficulties imposed by Proposition 12 on the retailing 
industry are illuminated in a recent response from the McDonalds' Board 
of Directors to a letter to shareholders from financier Carl Ichan. Mr. 
Ichan's letter asked the firm to commit to sourcing its pork from 
suppliers that abide by Proposition 12's standards regardless of the 
law's status. The response stated:

          ``McDonald's only sources approximately 1% of U.S. pork . . . 
        Mr. Icahn has asked for new commitments . . . requiring all of 
        McDonald's U.S. pork suppliers to move to `crate-free' pork and 
        set specific timeframes for doing so. The definition of `crate-
        free,' conjured up by the Humane Society of the United States 
        (HSUS), is so obscure that it represents an extremely niche 
        market comprising less than 0.1% of U.S. pork production. This 
        presents a challenge of supply. What Mr. Icahn is demanding 
        from McDonald's and other companies is completely unfeasible. 
        Based on current estimates, McDonald's would require at least 
        300-400 times the animals housed today in `crate-free' systems 
        to keep our supply chain running. It also presents a cost 
        challenge. McDonald's today pays a premium to purchase group-
        housed pork in accordance with our 2012 commitment. Sourcing 
        from this niche market . . . would significantly increase those 
        costs, placing a burden on all aspects of our business, our 
        supply chain and McDonald's customers, while lacking the broad 
        support of industry experts . . . his campaign would have one 
        certain outcome: a greater financial burden on customers.['']

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Market Segmentation Costs
    A bifurcated marketplace necessarily means that different qualities 
of a commodity that may not be obvious to the consumer must be 
identified and preserved throughout the marketing chain. Pork produced 
from pigs raised on operations that satisfy the space requirements of 
Proposition 12 must be identified and kept separate throughout the 
entire marketing chain, from farm, to processor, wholesaler, and 
retailer. Any agent in the marketing chain must be able to identify and 
keep separate ``certified'' pork products, under penalty of law. A 
concerned consumer must have confidence that the pork that they are 
purchasing is sourced from operations that satisfy the space 
requirements. Outside of a package label, consumers have no way of 
discerning how the hogs that were processed into the pork products on 
grocery shelves was produced.
    At the processor level, logistical difficulties arc likely to arise 
as compliant and noncompliant hogs are taken to the plant for 
processing. The product must remain separated throughout all stages of 
processing and eventually through packaging, wholesaling, and 
retailing. It is likely that processors, especially large ones, may 
find it more efficient to accept only one type of hog compliant or non-
compliant. This could close or complicate access to local markets for 
certain producers, increasing their own logistical costs. This could 
also force producers to adopt compliant production practices in order 
to have access to the relevant processors. These logistical 
complications may be especially acute for small producers, many of 
which lack the means to simply adopt new technologies. These 
complications could lead to a geographic bifurcation where local plants 
only accept hogs produced with compliant (or non-compliant) 
technologies. It is relevant to note that hogs, as a commodity, arc 
costly to ship, making the location of plants an important factor in 
the economic well-being of local producers.
    This type of identity preservation may be especially difficult and 
costly for operations that utilize bulk pork commodities. By their very 
definition, such bulk commodities are typically homogeneous in quality 
and may be highly processed prior to reaching the end consumer. Large-
scale food service operations often purchase very large amounts of 
lower valued trim cuts, which may be commingled from a variety of 
sources. For such operations, it will be costly to identify and segment 
pork derived from hogs produced under the restrictions of Proposition 
12.
    The difficulties associated with maintaining identity preservation 
have been demonstrated in the cases of corn and rice. A form of 
genetically modified corn, known as Starlink, was not approved for 
human consumption, and therefore had to be kept, separate from other 
corn hybrids. A similar case arose for MIR-162, a genetically modified 
corn hybrid from Syngenta that was not approved for sale in China. It 
proved impossible to prevent these corn hybrids from being commingled 
in the overall corn supply. Significant economic losses were realized 
by the companies that manufactured the corn seed as well as throughout 
the marketing chain. Prices to farmers dropped when portions of the 
global market for commodity corn were closed due to commingling. 
Numerous product recalls occurred, and agents throughout the marketing 
chain realized significant economic losses due to the loss of important 
markets for corn and commodities that were made from corn.
    Questions arise in such cases as to who carries the liability 
associated with violations of the regulations. It may be difficult to 
ascertain exactly who is responsible for the loss of identity 
preservation in cases of commingling or other inadvertent violations of 
the space requirements. The logistics associated with ensuring that all 
pork sold in California satisfies the proposition are complex. Such 
complexity adds to the basic costs of business for merchants selling 
pork in California and for processors and wholesalers supplying pork to 
California. It is difficult to assign value to this additional 
logistical burden, but the costs are most certainly substantial.
Processor Premiums
    To this point, I have focused attention on the costs of making the 
changes necessary to bring individual farms into compliance with the 
space requirements mandated for sows by California's Proposition 12. 
Because of the prominence of the California pork market and the fact 
that pork production in California is minuscule relative to its 
consumption, it is likely that many farms will have to undertake 
renovation of existing facilities or construction of facilities that 
are compliant with the proposition as existing facilities age out and 
are replaced by new construction. I have also noted the changes in 
market structure that will occur in response to the Supreme Court's 
upholding of Proposition 12. Pork products will need to be 
distinguished by whether (or not) they are compliant with the 
proposition. The market will be bifurcated according to production 
technologies. Growers will need additional compensation to encourage 
the long-term investments that the proposition demands.
    Herein lies a potential opportunity for compliant growers, albeit 
one that the free-market is best suited to address. Food product 
labeling that provides details regarding production practices (e.g., 
``cage-free,'' ``free-range,'' ``organic,'' etc.) may offer producers 
new opportunities to differentiate their product.\33\ Some producers 
that have adopted production practices that are compliant with 
Proposition 12 report premiums of $6-$10 per head, though the industry 
is still negotiating premiums and industry-wide standards have yet to 
be established. One producer noted that premiums tended to vary with 
the length of the production contract, with longer contracts generating 
higher premiums. Tyson and Hormel, two major pork processors, have 
already announced that they will comply with Proposition 12.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \33\ For example, Goodwin, Marra and Piggott (2016) found that food 
products labeled as being ``GMO-Free'' cost an average of 73% more than 
products lacking such a certification. See B.K. Goodwin, M.C. Marra, 
and N.H. Piggott, ``The cost of a GMO-free market basket of food in the 
United States,'' AgBioForum 19, No. 1, 2016.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    However, mandating all producers to comply, and therefore forcing 
all consumers and industries in the entire marketing chain to comply, 
would unnecessarily impose costs across the entire economy. The freedom 
to choose product attributes is a hallmark of the free-market system 
and legislation that enforces the opinions and attitudes of special 
interests on everyone eliminates this choice and imposes costs on the 
entire market. As the quote from McDonalds notes, a certain outcome of 
Proposition 12 is a greater financial burden on customers.
Concluding Remarks
    Proposition 12 stipulates that pork sold in California must be 
sourced from sows that have at least 24 square feet of space in 
breeding and finishing facilities. While the restrictions were to be 
implemented on January 1, 2022, litigation temporarily delayed its 
enforcement. The Supreme Court upheld the proposition and the 
constraints become fully binding in 2024. As of Jan. 1, 2024, all 
breeding swine farms will need formal Proposition 12 certification for 
wholesale buyers and distributors to sell pork into the California 
market. Pork products already in storage can be distributed until 
December 31, 2023, although any pork produced after July 1 must be 
compliant. Producers already in compliance can self-certify until 
December 31, at which point they must be certified by an auditor 
approved by the California Department of Food and Agriculture. Market 
impacts will be gradual as pork already in the marketing chain will be 
gradually exhausted.
    The proposition will be costly to the production and marketing 
chain for pork in the U.S. At present, only about 4% of facilities 
satisfy the space requirements, though many growers are undertaking the 
investments necessary to produce compliant pork products. The 
uncertainty surrounding the implementation and enforcement of the 
proposition led to a ``wait and see'' attitude by many in the pork 
producing sector, but this uncertainty has now been resolved. Although 
the details regarding implementation and enforcement have been 
resolved, uncertainty still exists as to whether additional states will 
adopt their own unique regulations and therefore whether producers will 
be forced to comply with a 50 state patchwork of laws.
    Renovation and new construction costs run into several millions of 
dollars for the typical hog operation. Estimates of the cost of new 
construction vary considerably but mostly ranged from $3,600-$4,000 per 
sow in 2021. If we assume a 12.5% increase in the costs of materials 
and labor for new construction, a new facility that is fully 
Proposition 12 compliant would currently cost about $4,500 per sow. 
Estimates of the cost to renovate existing facilities to be compliant 
with the proposition vary widely and depend largely on the starting 
point for the renovation. It may cost as little as $100 per sow or as 
much as $1,000 per sow. In some cases, depending on the vintage of 
existing facilities, it may be more costly to renovate than to build 
new barns. Recent increases in the costs of construction and credit 
have made renovation and new construction of compliant facilities even 
more costly.
    The impact of Proposition 12 will not be homogeneous across all hog 
producers. In the short run, the market will be segmented and supplies 
of pork in California will be constrained. This will result from a 
shortage of compliant pork. At the same time, noncompliant pork that 
once was sold in California will be relegated to the rest of the U.S. 
market, depressing prices of pork everywhere except California, where 
pork prices will rise substantially. Given the delays in resolving 
legal challenges and in enforcing the regulations, these effects will 
be modest. New construction will likely consider the increased space 
requirement in new facility designs and in the long run much of the 
industry is likely to become compliant with these restrictions.
    As I have noted, the extent to which consumers comprehend animal 
welfare issues and recognize the differences across different types of 
livestock and production systems is unclear. More specifically, 
consumers may not fully understand the nuances associated with 
different livestock animals and their space needs. As is often the 
case, regulatory initiatives that are promoted by special interests may 
not be consistent with sound scientific evidence and the extent to 
which voters arc able to separate emotional rhetoric from sound 
scientific evidence is questionable.
    The costs of the restrictions are widespread and extensive. Farmers 
face the costs of renovation or the construction of new facilities. 
These costs are currently exacerbated by significant increases in 
building costs and the cost of credit. Farmers will face losses in 
productivity as they move to new production and management systems. 
This lost productivity will he especially acute in the short run, as 
the new systems are mastered. The new production systems will lead to 
increased stress on breeding sows, which in turn will lead to lower 
fertility and embryo survival rates. The industry will be required to 
maintain identity preservation and market segmentations. This will 
involve considerable changes to the logistics of pork product 
distribution.
    These costs will have a more severe impact on smaller, independent 
operations. As I have shown, these operations tend to be less efficient 
and have lower profit margins. Smaller operations also have less access 
to the credit needed to finance renovations and new construction. Thus, 
one important outcome of Proposition 12 will be an increase in the exit 
of smaller hog operations. The pork industry will become more 
concentrated with fewer but bigger farm operations. The stresses placed 
upon the entire production and marketing chain will also favor larger 
processors, thereby leading to ever-increasing consolidation and 
concentration of the industry.
    This document provides a high-level summary of the expected impacts 
of California's Proposition 12. Much greater research is needed to 
address the impacts of the proposition on heterogeneous farm 
operations, packers, wholesalers, and retailers. More in-depth 
empirical research is needed to quantify the impacts of the regulations 
and the long-term adjustments that the industry will realize. The costs 
of the proposition will be significant and will impact the entire 
marketing chain.

Biden Takes Aim at Grocery Chains Over Food Prices
          President Biden has begun to accuse stores of overcharging 
        shoppers, as food costs remain a burden for consumers and a 
        political problem for the President.

Feb. 1, 2024

    President Biden, whose approval rating has suffered amid high 
inflation, is beginning to pressure large grocery chains to slash food 
prices for American consumers, accusing the stores of reaping excess 
profits and ripping off shoppers.
    ``There are still too many corporations in America ripping people 
off: price gouging, junk fees, greedflation, shrinkflation,'' Mr. Biden 
said last week in South Carolina.\2\ Aides say those comments are a 
preview of more pressure to come against grocery chains and other 
companies that are maintaining higher-than-usual profit margins after a 
period of rapid price growth.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Mr. Biden's public offensive reflects the political reality that, 
while inflation is moderating, voters are angry about how much they are 
paying at the grocery store, and that is weighing on Mr. Biden's 
approval rating ahead of the 2024 election.
    Economic research suggests \3\ the cost of eggs, milk and other 
staples--which consumers buy far more frequently than big-ticket items 
like furniture or electronics--play an outsize role in shaping 
Americans' views of inflation. Those prices jumped more than 11 percent 
in 2022 and five percent last year, amid a post-pandemic inflation 
surge that was the nation's fastest burst of price increases in 4 
decades.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ https://www.nber.org/papers/w26237.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The rate of increase is slowing rapidly: In December, prices for 
food consumed at home were up by just over one percent, according to 
the Labor Department.\4\ But Administration officials say Mr. Biden is 
keenly aware that prices remain too elevated for many families, even as 
key items, like gasoline and household furnishings, are now cheaper 
than they were at their post-pandemic peak.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUSR0000SAF11.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    And yet there is a general belief across Administration officials 
and their allies that there is little else Mr. Biden could do 
unilaterally to force grocery prices down quickly.
    ``It's hard to figure out what the short-term policy response is in 
this situation,'' said Bharat Ramamurti, a former economic aide to Mr. 
Biden and an author of a report on grocery-price inflation that the 
progressive Groundwork Collaborative in Washington published on Friday.
    ``When you have something that is driven in part by supply 
disruptions, what can you actually do to put downward pressure on 
prices?'' he said.
    The Federal Trade Commission is reviewing--and widely expected to 
block--a merger between two large grocery-store chains, Kroger and 
Albertsons. Opponents of the deal say it would reduce competition and 
allow the merged company to charge shoppers higher prices. But blocking 
that deal would do little to address the current price pop.
    A Kroger executive on Thursday welcomed Mr. Biden's increased focus 
on grocer profits, insisting that the merger would reduce costs for 
customers.
    ``We agree with President Biden: Too many grocers in America have 
increased margins in contrast to Kroger, who have reduced our margins 
consistently for nearly 20 years to save customers billions,'' said 
Keith Dailey, Kroger's group Vice President of Corporate Affairs and 
Chief Sustainability Officer. ``Through our merger with Albertsons, 
Kroger will lower prices for even more of America's consumers.''
    A new analysis from the White House Council of Economic Advisers 
suggests that elevated profit margins among large grocery retailers 
could be contributing to the stubbornly high price of food on store 
shelves. The analysis, which relies on Quarterly Financial Reports data 
from the Census Bureau, found that food and beverage stores had 
increased their margins by about two percentage points since the eve of 
the pandemic, reaching their highest level in 2 decades.
    Much of that increase came in 2021 and 2022, around the time that 
other retailers--like clothing and sporting goods stores--also saw 
profit margins jump. Grocery-store margins have stayed elevated, the 
analysis finds, even as other retailers' margins have fallen back to 
more normal levels based on recent history.
    ``President Biden has made clear that as input prices fall, 
corporations should pass those savings on to consumers,'' Michael 
Kikukawa, a White House spokesman, said this week.
    Mr. Biden made a similar point last fall in a post on the social 
media platform X.

    But the White House analysis also implies that increased grocery 
profit margins do not come close to accounting for the price spikes 
that grocery shoppers have experienced under Mr. Biden's tenure.

    Other research suggests additional forces--like consumer demand and 
supply-chain disruptions--are a much bigger factor in the price 
increases. A bout of avian flu caused egg prices to spike \5\ last 
year, for example. And food producers, like soft-drink manufacturers, 
have continued to raise prices \6\ even as their costs have declined, 
leading to heady profit margins.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Researchers from the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City found last 
year \7\ that strong job growth in the U.S. economy, and the wage gains 
associated with a tight labor market, were key contributors to grocery-
price increases. Processed foods, like candy bars, account for \3/4\ of 
recent grocery price increases, the researchers found.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The tight labor market, they said, had resulted in higher costs for 
producing and distributing those foods, ``which have been passed on to 
consumers.''
    Mr. Biden's Administration has tried several efforts to soothe 
grocery price pressures,\8\ particularly on the supply side. The 
Agriculture Department has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to 
help companies expand in the meatpacking industry, which is dominated 
by a handful of large players.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\ https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/25/business/biden-
inflation.html.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The department also changed its calculations of Federal food 
assistance benefits and adjusted them for inflation, effectively 
increasing the value of food stamps for many low-income Americans. Mr. 
Ramamurti and his co-authors, Elizabeth Pancotti and Clara Wilson, 
calculate those increases have more than outweighed the increased cost 
of groceries for 40 million families in recent years.
    In an interview, Ms. Pancotti said the consumers feeling the most 
pain from high food prices were the ones who earned just enough money 
not to qualify for the food-stamp program, which is known as SNAP.
    ``You have this huge chunk of people in the middle who are low-
income, but not impoverished enough to get SNAP benefits, and paying 25 
percent more'' for groceries, she said. ``At the end of the day, it 
just doesn't reach enough people.''
    The commission is also considering enforcement actions \9\ under a 
nearly 90-year-old law, the Robinson-Patman Act, which requires 
suppliers of retail goods to offer the same terms to every retailer 
they sell to. Supporters of those enforcement actions say they would 
drive down prices at smaller grocers, by ensuring they can buy items 
for the same cost as large retailers.

    Politically, though, big grocers make the most appealing target for 
Mr. Biden. Aides are discussing how he can ramp up pressure on large

Fraud is gobbling up one-fifth of SNAP benefits; Congress must act to 
        stop it

    As the nation embarks on the essential task of crafting this year's 
farm bill, a pressing matter demands our immediate attention: 
fortifying program integrity within the Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program (SNAP).
    The urgency to tackle fraud and abuse within this vital social 
safety net cannot be overstated. While SNAP remains a lifeline for 
millions of vulnerable Americans, its effectiveness and sustainability 
hinge on our ability to uphold a high standard of anti-fraud measures.
    SNAP has long stood as a cornerstone of our nation's commitment to 
alleviating hunger and supporting low-income families. It extends 
crucial aid to over 40 million individuals monthly, providing them 
access to affordable and nutritious food. Nevertheless, recent reports 
and studies have raised valid concerns about the prevalence of 
fraudulent activities within the program. These activities not only 
undermine its intended purpose but also erode public trust in 
government welfare programs.
    Efforts to combat fraud and abuse within SNAP should transcend 
party lines. They reflect a shared responsibility to ensure the 
efficient and effective use of taxpayer dollars. By allocating 
resources toward program integrity measures, we can guarantee that 
those genuinely in need receive assistance, while deterring those who 
seek to exploit the system for personal gain.
    One of the most immediate challenges is the issue of EBT skimming, 
whereby criminals pilfer benefits from deserving SNAP recipients and 
convert them to cash or make bulk purchases at major retail outlets. 
Although card skimmers have long plagued ATM and credit card users, 
this issue has recently evolved into a nationwide epidemic directly 
targeting our most vulnerable citizens. While credit and debit cards 
now incorporate advanced chip technology to thwart criminals attempting 
to misuse ``white plastic'' materials, such as hotel keys, for 
fraudulent purposes, SNAP remains vulnerable.
    The safeguarding of vulnerable citizens commences with rigorous 
identity verification. As attested by the United Council on Welfare 
before Congress, SNAP stands as the last major government assistance 
program lacking effective identity verification tools used globally. 
Outdated rules, regulations, and a lax approach to anti-fraud measures 
have led to international fraud organizations, terrorist groups, and 
foreign nation-states taking advantage.
    Transnational criminals can reprogram credit card point-of-sale 
devices to mimic legitimate retailers. They employ massive bot attacks, 
similar to distributed denial of service attacks on websites, to 
conduct balance inquiries using scripted PIN numbers. The accounts with 
matching cards and PIN numbers are promptly drained.
    Another pertinent and substantial concern revolves around the 
trafficking of SNAP benefits, whereby recipients themselves exchange 
their benefits for cash or non-food items. This not only diverts 
resources from their intended purpose, but also defeats the purpose of 
the program, jeopardizing the health and well-being of program 
beneficiaries.
    The adage that ``it takes two to tango'' holds true here--
trafficking cannot occur without willing recipients and retailers. 
According to USDA reports and activities, eliminating dishonest 
retailers from the pool of 250,000 stores nationwide would require 
nearly 3 decades. But the means and authority to begin vetting 
retailers is lacking and must be provided through legislation.
    The 2018 Farm Bill made strides in addressing this issue, but more 
action is needed. More stringent penalties for traffickers and better 
data sharing among Federal and state agencies can establish a stronger 
deterrent against such fraudulent activities.
    Technology plays a pivotal role in modernizing and enhancing 
program integrity efforts. Investment in advanced data analytics and 
digital verification systems can help detect anomalies and patterns 
indicative of fraud. Through technological leverage, we can streamline 
administrative burdens for both recipients and program administrators 
while significantly bolstering our ability to identify and prevent 
fraud, including identity fraud originating abroad.
    This was the objective of the National Accuracy Clearinghouse, a 
proven project that had been set to roll out to all states by the end 
of 2021. Regrettably, the USDA chose an alternative pilot program that 
is set to conclude in 2027.
    We possess the ability to utilize data to diminish application 
fraud, expedite benefits distribution to qualified individuals, and 
maintain SNAP's status as the most effective government assistance 
program. In the aftermath of the fraud that plagued pandemic relief 
programs, Congress bears the responsibility to safeguard this 
initiative. This entails enhancing information sharing and coordination 
to create a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of an 
individual's benefit eligibility, reducing the potential for fraudulent 
claims to slip through the cracks.
    Recently, the USDA Food and Nutrition Service disclosed the payment 
error rate (PER) for all states. The PER forms a component of the 
accountability checks and balances to ensure that state and county SNAP 
agencies accurately determine eligibility and benefit amounts.
    Regrettably, the national PER hit an all-time high this year at 
11.54 percent, meaning that there is $34 million in overpayments daily. 
Preventing this waste from funding our adversaries isn't a matter of 
partisanship--it's a duty we all share as Americans.
    Lastly, states must receive the funds and means to detect, prevent, 
and prosecute fraud. This becomes challenging when the USDA allocates 
only 0.05 percent of its budget to program integrity.
    As legislators deliberate the components of this year's farm bill, 
addressing program integrity within SNAP must retain a central position 
in discussions. This year's farm bill provides an opportune moment to 
reaffirm our commitment to combating fraud and abuse within SNAP, 
ensuring its continued service as a lifeline for those in need.
    Let us seize this moment to enact substantive reforms that 
reinforce program integrity, underscoring our unwavering dedication to 
a fair and equitable society for all.

Weaponizing Wheat: How Strategic Competition With Russia Could Threaten 
        American Food Security
By Karl A. Scheuerman, Joint Force Quarterly 111

          Lieutenant Colonel Karl A. Scheuerman, USAF, wrote this essay

    In the history of warfare, belligerents have often targeted food 
supplies to force opponents into submission. However, in America's wars 
over the last century, threats to domestic food security have been 
minimal. In many ways, the United States enjoyed insulation from combat 
conditions overseas that could have otherwise disrupted the country's 
ability to feed itself. Complacency in relative isolation from 
disruptive food shocks is no longer a luxury the United States can 
afford. We are now in an era of increased globalization, where food 
supply chains span the oceans. In addition, America faces the renewed 
rise of strategic competition as China and Russia seek to replace U.S. 
power across the globe. Given these new realities, timely evaluation of 
potential vulnerabilities to American food production is necessary.
    Among rising strategic competitors, Russia has explicitly 
demonstrated a clear willingness to target food systems. In its current 
war against Ukraine, the Russian military has relentlessly attacked 
wheat supplies and production. Yet despite the critical importance 
wheat plays as the foremost American dietary staple, its production is 
indeed vulnerable to disruption should Russia choose to act. While a 
full-scale conventional war with Russia is unlikely because of nuclear 
deterrence, the Kremlin has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to 
disrupt foreign interests over the past several years, from election 
interference to trade wars. Targeting the U.S. wheat industry could 
become another preferred option for the Kremlin to wage adversarial 
competition at a level below the threshold of armed conflict. Given the 
emerging global security environment, the U.S. Government should 
reevaluate current policies to ensure the resilience of the wheat 
industry against this threat.
Wheat Is King in America
    Grain plays an enormous role in feeding the world. Approximately 47 
percent of all human caloric intake today comes from grains, and the 
United States is a significant contributor to global grain supplies.\1\ 
According to the United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization, 
the United States is the second largest grain producer in the world 
(behind only China), producing over 450 million metric tons, which 
represents 15 percent of the worldwide supply.\2\ Of all grains the 
United States produces, Americans consume more wheat than any other, 
making it the country's most essential food staple.\3\ U.S. farmers 
raise greater volumes of corn and soybeans, but most of those 
commodities are used for livestock feed and biofuels.\4\ Due to wheat's 
central role in the American food system, consumer demand for products 
derived from wheat is ``relatively stable and largely unaffected by 
changes in wheat prices or disposable income,'' according to the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA).\5\ As shown in figure 1, demand for 
wheat in the United States continues to grow. Thus, wheat represents a 
worthwhile case study in evaluating U.S. resiliency to food disruption 
in the context of strategic competition, specifically with Russia.

    Some may find it hard to envision a scenario where the United 
States would experience wheat shortages. However, recent examples of 
modern countries suffering significant wheat production losses exist. 
Russia, the world's largest wheat exporter, suffered extensive drought 
and wildfires in 2011 and lost \1/3\ of its national wheat crop as a 
result.\6\ China, the global leader in wheat production, suffered wheat 
crop losses of up to 16 percent between 2000 and 2018 due to pests and 
pathogens.\7\ Another breadbasket of the world, Ukraine, will likely 
see its 2022-2023 wheat output decline by 41 percent compared to the 
previous year because of the Russia-Ukraine war.\8\

Implications of Domestic Wheat Shortages
    If America were to experience wheat shortages, the implications 
would be significant. As the United States is the third largest wheat 
exporter on the global market, a drop in U.S. supplies would negatively 
impact world food prices.\9\ Following the decline in Russian wheat 
exports in 2011, food prices spiked and contributed to dramatic 
instability in countries dependent on imports, helping give rise to the 
Arab Spring.\10\ Trade partners, including key allies such as Japan and 
South Korea, who rely on U.S. wheat imports would likely feel the pinch 
most acutely in countering Russian and Chinese influence.

Spring.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    But significant domestic concerns could pose a greater risk. In 
1906, journalist Alfred Henry Lewis presciently stated, ``There are 
only nine meals between mankind and anarchy.'' Unlike any other 
commodity, food is the one we cannot survive without. If interruptions 
to the food supply occurred, the public's confidence in future 
availability might begin to erode, spreading fear. Those now living 
below the poverty line would suffer the most, but even the broader 
citizenry could start losing confidence in the government's ability to 
provide basic needs, fueling an already tense and polarized domestic 
political climate.
    If disruptions affected U.S. wheat production, food substitutes 
would play a role in softening the impact. However, given wheat's 
primacy in our food system, the volume of substitutes needed could pose 
major challenges. A national grain reserve, similar in concept to the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, would be a logical buffer to mitigate 
shortages, but unfortunately, no such reserve exists. Despite producing 
more grain than any other country on earth, China has established a 
national reserve that reportedly now contains at least 2 years' worth 
of grain supplies should the country need it.\11\ The United States has 
previously tried establishing a national grain reserve, most recently 
with the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust. However, the trust sold off 
its commodity holdings in response to food price spikes resulting from 
the 2008 financial crisis and now only holds cash reserves to help pay 
for famine relief needs abroad.\12\

    Should a worst-case scenario arise where the entire annual U.S. 
wheat harvest failed, existing stocks would quickly evaporate if 
current consumption levels remained constant. In the last crop year of 
2021-2022, American farmers produced 1,646 million bushels of wheat, 
while domestic demand (comprised of human food use, animal feed, and 
seed) for the year totaled 1,117 million.\13\ After factoring in 
exports and the previous year's residuals, the remaining stock of U.S. 
wheat after the previous crop year was 669 million bushels, and this is 
expected to decrease further next year to its lowest levels since 2007-
2008 (table 1).\14\

    Applying a ``time-to-survive'' analysis to the hypothetical worst-
case scenario, which measures the maximum duration that supply could 
match demand (assuming the previous domestic demand level held constant 
and exports were canceled), existing domestic wheat stocks would last 
only about 7 months.\15\ Unlike other industries, agriculture does not 
have the option of surging production when a crisis arises as it is 
constrained by annual growing seasons. The United States could not 
replenish its wheat stocks with domestic production until the next 
summer harvest season.

resilience is attributable to David Simchi-Levi, William Schmidt, and

    Food shocks and price spikes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic 
and Russia's war in Ukraine have helped Washington realize our food 
system's fragility. The latest National Security Strategy under 
President Joe Biden cites food security as one of the top five shared 
global challenges. It highlights global initiatives the United States 
is currently leading, including efforts to urge other states to commit 
to ``keeping food and agricultural markets open, increasing fertilizer 
production, and investing in climate-resilient agriculture.'' \16\ 
These efforts are worthwhile, but America must ensure its increased 
focus on global food insecurity does not turn a blind eye to potential 
vulnerabilities in domestic food production that a disruptive adversary 
such as Russia could exploit.

Moscow's Increasingly Disruptive Actions
    Over the past 2 decades, while the Russian Federation has enjoyed a 
resurgence of economic growth and global influence under Vladimir 
Putin's leadership, the Kremlin has demonstrated a repeated willingness 
to undermine U.S. interests. The reasons for this approach are rooted 
in what has become characterized as the Primakov doctrine, which 
``posits that a unipolar world dominated by the United States is 
unacceptable to Russia.'' \17\ In operationalizing the Primakov 
doctrine, Russia has been conducting a hybrid war in part to 
``fo[r]ment chaos, create distrust in U.S. institutions, and target the 
preexisting divisions in the country.'' \18\  Through these actions, 
Russia has earned a reputation as a perilous threat ``with the goal of 
overturning key elements of the international order.'' \19\

    There is no shortage of examples illustrating why Russia is now 
characterized this way. The United States has attributed several 
significant cyber attacks \20\ targeting American industry and 
governmental organizations to Russia in recent decades.\21\ The Kremlin 
has also gone to great lengths to interfere with the democratic process 
Americans cherish. The clearest example of this approach was during the 
2016 Presidential election. According to the U.S. Intelligence 
Community and Department of Justice investigations, the Kremlin 
directed extensive information warfare operations to influence the 
election outcome, resulting in distrust among the U.S. citizenry in the 
reliability of our electoral system.\22\

    \20\ The term cyber attack in today's lexicon is vague and holds 
multiple meanings. For the purposes of this essay, the term refers to 
computer network intrusions and disruptions. This contrasts with other 
forms of information warfare, such as influence operations, that 
leverage communications networks to influence targeted audiences.

    Russia is now also seeking to undermine the U.S.-led global 
economic system. Suffering from unprecedented Western sanctions as 
punishment for its war in Ukraine, Russia is countering with its own 
strategies to establish a global economy that excludes the West. Not 
only have the Russians cut natural gas supplies to Europe, but they are 
also replacing access to Western marketing by increasing trade with 
China, India, and other countries. Russia has also been championing its 
own alternative to the SWIFT international financial messaging 
system.\23\

    These examples demonstrate Russia's repeated attempts to undermine 
American strength and interests. Outcomes from these efforts have 
resulted in various levels of success in sowing seeds of domestic chaos 
to destabilize U.S. society. Should the Kremlin succeed in 
significantly disrupting Americans' ability to sufficiently access 
cheap and convenient food, the impact could become far more intense 
than what Russia has achieved to this point.

Experienced Cereal Killers
    While their attempts to disrupt U.S. interests in the post-Cold War 
era have yet to target food directly, the Russians have found it a 
preferred tactic elsewhere. In fact, during their current war in 
Ukraine, attacking wheat storage and production has been a top 
priority, and they have done so with remarkable efficacy. Ukraine is 
one of the world's most productive breadbaskets, producing over 85 
million metric tons of wheat annually.\24\ Ukraine was the world's 
fourth largest wheat exporter on the global market during the 2021-2022 
crop year.\25\ Recognizing Ukrainian grain as a critical center of 
gravity, Russian forces have employed a relentless multifaceted 
strategy to destroy that element of the Ukrainian economy.

apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/app/index.html#/app/advQuery.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The first element of this strategy is the theft of Ukrainian 
agricultural machinery. Since the early weeks of the war, media outlets 
have reported multiple instances of Russian forces ransacking Ukrainian 
grain stocks, shipping their contents back to Russian territory and 
sending it to Russian cargo vessels for export to global Russian 
trading partners.\26\ Some estimates claim that millions of tons of 
grain from eastern Ukraine have been seized, triggering nightmares of 
the Soviet-induced Ukrainian famine of 1932-1933.\27\ Russians looted 
farm machinery dealerships and stole combines, tractors, and 
implements.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The second component of the Russian strategy to eliminate Ukrainian 
wheat is destruction. Not only have battles prevented farmers in 
certain regions of eastern Ukraine from tending to their fields, but 
Russian forces have also laid waste to Ukrainian cropland by burning 
vast acreages across the Donetsk, Mykolaiv, and Kherson regions. 
Russian bombing and missile strikes have destroyed the logistical 
infrastructure essential to wheat production and delivery, including 
irrigation systems, grain elevators, and port terminals. Seeking to 
damage Ukraine's ability to recover from the conflict, Russia went so 
far as to target Ukraine's National Gene Bank located in Kharkiv, which 
served as the country's seed bank, housing some 160,000 specimens of 
plant and crop seeds.\28\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \28\ Ibid.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A third pillar of the Russian strategy undermining wheat production 
in Ukraine has focused on Ukraine's ability to export its grain. In the 
early days of the war, the Russian naval blockade of Ukraine's Black 
Sea ports strangled Ukrainian exports, cutting off essential means for 
Kyiv to participate in global markets. Agricultural commodities are 
Ukraine's top exports, including $4.61 billion worth of wheat alone in 
2020.\29\ Blockading the Black Sea ports was painful for Ukraine and 
the many countries relying on Ukrainian wheat to feed their 
populations, contributing to damaging global food price spikes and 
inflation over the ensuing months. Not until August 2022 did Russia 
agree to lift the blockade, based on a tenuous agreement brokered with 
assistance from the UN and Turkey. Even since the initial agreement, 
the Kremlin has unilaterally suspended it once and has threatened not 
to renew the deal.\30\

    Ukraine's experience during the current Russian invasion reveals 
the lengths to which Russia is willing to go to intentionally attack 
wheat production and supplies, even when that grain is a vital 
component of the local and global food system. Based on this precedent, 
the United States and its allies must be prepared to defend against the 
variety of tactics Moscow could employ to attack wheat production 
elsewhere.

Russia's Emergence as a Global Food Power
    Competition between Washington and Moscow that is centered around 
grain is nothing new. Following the U.S. Civil War in the 1860s, cheap 
American wheat flooded global markets for the first time, pushing 
Russian wheat exports out of Europe. The U.S.-Russian grain trade 
rivalry was a key factor in conditions that ultimately ushered in World 
War I.\31\ Wheat has continued to play a major, albeit behind the 
scenes role in U.S.-Russian relations ever since.

    When Putin became President in 2000, Russia relied on imports to 
meet half its domestic food needs. Prioritizing food security, the 
Russian President has since successfully executed initiatives to boost 
food production, and grain has been a critical focus. By 2017, Russia 
had become the world's top wheat exporter, and the Kremlin has no plans 
to cede its pole position. Despite unprecedented sanctions from the 
West as punishment for its war in Ukraine, Russia still has plenty of 
buyers for its wheat exports in the Middle East and Asia as it strives 
to outproduce and out-compete American farmers.\32\ Even China began 
importing Russian wheat this year after previously placing a ban on it 
due to concerns about the presence of a crop disease (dwarf bunt

increase the value of agricultural exports by 50 percent by 2024.\34\

    Recent global supply chain disruptions from events such as the war

privileged position in terms of food security. Russia is the world's

relative strength in this area and a demonstrated willingness to attack 
Ukrainian wheat, attacking the domestic American wheat industry could 
become a viable option in Russia's arsenal of hybrid warfare tactics 
against U.S. interests. Specific strategies Russia could employ to 
target U.S. wheat production can be organized into four categories of 
attack:

Disruption Option 1: Cyber Attacks Targeting Grain Infrastructure
    Among the cyber-security industry, many consider Russia to be the 
most capable and stealthiest of America's cyber adversaries. In 
addition to the notable intrusions mentioned earlier, suspected Russian 
adversary groups have earned their reputation for several reasons, 
including developing sophisticated malware that employed novel command 
and control techniques, exhibiting rapid breakout times, and leading 
the way in targeting cloud infrastructure.\36\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Cyber attacks crippling the food industry are not unprecedented. 
For example, suspected criminals successfully compromised the network 
of JBS S.A., a global meat processing company, hampering livestock 
slaughter operations and causing wholesale meat prices to spike.\37\ 
Should the Kremlin set its sights on disrupting the U.S. wheat industry 
via cyber means, a likely approach would be targeting the 
infrastructure used for grain transport and storage, specifically the 
grain storage elevators throughout wheat production regions. These 
facilities comprise an essential component of the Nation's food system, 
which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has identified as 1 of 
the 16 sectors of critical infrastructure.\38\ Farming cooperatives 
operating grain elevators increasingly leverage automation technologies 
to handle loading and unloading functions. If an adversary gained 
remote access to the industrial control system (ICS) network 
environment, they could shut down operations, preventing grain 
transportation to trade markets and food processors.

    Russian state-sponsored adversaries are known to have successfully 
targeted a critical infrastructure ICS environment, causing kinetic 
effects. A cyber unit within the Russian military was responsible for 
the attack on the Ukrainian power grid, resulting in nearly \1/4\ 
million Ukrainians losing power for about 6 hours.\39\ A similar attack 
chain methodology could disrupt control systems for other sectors of 
critical infrastructure, such as grain storage facilities.

Cyberwar and the Hunt for the Kremlin's Most Dangerous Hackers (New 
York: Doubleday, 2019), 52-53.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A less sophisticated means of attack on grain elevators would be to 
infect the traditional computer networks operating at these facilities 
in attempts to affect operations. This has already happened on several 
occasions. Between the fall of 2021 and early 2022, six U.S. grain 
cooperative elevator facilities experienced ransomware attacks on their 
business networks that inhibited processing as some were forced to 
adjust to manual operations. Recognizing the threatening trend, the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)'s Cyber Division issued a Private 
Industry Notice to assist grain cooperative organizations better 
prepare their defenses.\40\ The FBI's report also noted the potential 
for an impact on commodities trading and stocks that could result in 
food security and inflation concerns.

Cooperatives Potentially Timed to Critical Seasons,'' Security

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Another potential cyber attack against the wheat industry that 
could lead to severe outcomes would be a more typical intrusion into 
agriculture industry business networks. Large agriculture firms have 
not been immune from network intrusions aimed at stealing intellectual 
property. Unlike the other attacks mentioned, where the objective is to 
perform sabotage or shut down a network for ransom, cyber-security 
firms have noted that intellectual property theft intrusions targeting 
agriculture firms are on the rise.\41\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Should Russian-aligned adversaries gain access to sensitive 
agriculture industry data, they could facilitate further disruptive 
strategies. For example, stolen documents and data could be altered and 
then leaked publicly, delivering damaging false messages like the 
hackers who doctored data stolen from Pfizer to undermine public trust 
in vaccines.\42\ Similarly, grain pathology and trade experts note that 
false claims of wheat crop disease would have dramatic adverse effects 
on American grain exports.\43\ Undermining American interests related 
to global trade introduces additional options at the Kremlin's disposal 
for disrupting U.S. wheat production.

Disruption Option 2: Restricting Fertilizer Exports
    The United States is a net exporter of food. As such, some assume 
the country is self-sufficient in meeting domestic food needs. However, 
that conclusion is tenuous because American agriculture depends on 
imports of foreign synthetic fertilizer. Less than one percent of U.S. 
farmland is organic.\44\ Farming the remaining 99 percent involves 
conventional methods. One characteristic of conventional agriculture is 
the ``extensive use of pesticides, fertilizers, and external energy 
inputs.'' \45\ Despite the United States having a relatively robust 
fertilizer production industry, it does not currently provide for all 
domestic farming needs. According to the USDA, ``The United States is a 
major importer and dependent on foreign fertilizer and is the second or 
third top importer for each of the three major components of 
fertilizer.'' \46\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The three primary fertilizer nutrients required to grow crops are 
nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Nitrogen fertilizer is derived 
from the Haber-Bosch process, which uses natural gas for fuel to 
extract nitrogen from the air to form ammonia. Phosphorus fertilizer 
comes from mining of nonrenewable phosphate rock. Potassium fertilizer 
is derived from mining nonrenewable potash. As of 2021, the United 
States imported 12 percent of its nitrogen, nine percent of its 
phosphate, and 93 percent of its potash.\47\ While America imports 
these materials from many friendly states, some come from less-trusted 
trading partners. This is especially true of potash. Russia and its 
close ally, Belarus, combine to provide 12 percent of America's 
potassium requirements and more than 15 percent of total U.S. 
fertilizer imports (figure 2).\48\

    Should Russia choose to disrupt wheat production by stopping potash 
exports, America would need to find ways to ramp up domestic mining and 
production or close the gap by increasing imports from friendly trade 
partners such as Canada, which already supplies 83 percent of potash 
used in the United States. A more significant cause for concern is that 
Russia is the world's largest fertilizer exporter when considering all 
fertilizer components and is responsible for over 15 percent of total 
global fertilizer exports.\49\ Leveraging that influence, Russia could 
attempt to manipulate availability on the global market, resulting in 
worldwide price shocks that would cascade to American consumers and 
place additional pressure on poorer countries already suffering from 
food security challenges.

    Russian impacts on global fertilizer trade have already contributed 
to financial instability. Fertilizer prices tripled after the beginning 
of the war in Ukraine because Russia limited exports. These limits 
included restrictions on exports of natural gas, which, as noted, is a 
crucial component for producing nitrogen fertilizer.\50\ Russia also 
shut down an ammonia fertilizer pipeline from its Volga region to a 
Black Sea port to further restrict global supplies.\51\ The USDA 
characterized the situation as ``Putin's price hike on farmers.'' \52\ 
These events contributed to soaring food costs, leading to the highest 
inflation rates in the United States in 4 decades.\53\

    In late 2022, the UN warned that if fertilizer prices were not 
reduced, the world would face a ``future crisis'' of food availability. 
UN officials have since worked to convince Russia to increase 
fertilizer output.\54\ Thanks to rebounding global fertilizer 
production, fertilizer price fears have dampened for the near term.\55\ 
Nevertheless, the situation demonstrates how the Kremlin can leverage 
its fertilizer superiority to harm the interests of not only the United 
States but also the world. Unfortunately, fertilizer availability is 
not the only way Moscow can flex its muscle in undermining American 
wheat production. Undercutting U.S. grain exports is another area where 
the American wheat industry is vulnerable to Russian meddling.

Disruption Option 3: Undercutting U.S. Wheat Exports in Global Markets
    America's farmers have historically benefited from growing more 
wheat than the country consumes and being able to sell excess grain to 
overseas markets. In crop year 2021-2022, the United States exported 
$7.3 billion of wheat, making it the world's third largest wheat 
exporter, behind Russia and Australia.\56\ According to the USDA, in 
the early 2000s, the United States was responsible for roughly 25 
percent of the world's wheat exports, but that dominance has dwindled 
now to 13 percent.\57\ America's share of global wheat exports has 
shrunk over the past 20 years as Russia has strengthened its position 
as the world's wheat superpower.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Increasing international competition in wheat trading has strained 
U.S. wheat exports in recent years, and this trend is expected to 
continue. Competition from Russia, especially in African and Middle 
Eastern markets, poses a significant challenge.\58\ Russia has shown it 
is willing to use food trade as a tool of diplomatic force. When 
Bulgaria ceased transiting Russian gas to Europe, Turkey agreed to 
facilitate its transit in exchange for receiving wheat imports from 
Russia. Elsewhere, Russia sold wheat to Iran as part of a deal to help 
sell Iranian oil. Moscow willingly enters commodity trade markets even 
if it means undercutting its allies, as Iran experienced this year when 
Russia discounted its steel exports and grabbed Iranian market 
share.\59\ Wheat industry analysts expect Russia to continue pushing 
boundaries to secure access to wheat export markets, especially in 
regions with rapid population growth, like southeast Asia.\60\

    Waging information warfare would be another scheme the Kremlin 
could employ to win in export markets. As mentioned, crafting and 
communicating a hoax that falsely claims American wheat supplies are 
contaminated with disease would cause buyers to seek alternative 
sources.\61\ Rules over grain disease quarantines can be a sensitive 
political subject between traders, even without misinformation 
campaigns. When coupled with stolen and altered data derived from a 
coordinated cyber intrusion, the United States would have difficulty 
eliminating concerns about the quality of American wheat stocks.

    Complicating the issue is that prior incidents of contaminated U.S. 
wheat exports could strengthen Russian hoax claims. The Soviet Union 
and several other countries complained of dirty, rotting, and insect-
ridden U.S. grain in the 1980s.\62\ In the mid-1990s, the USDA had to 
institute a regulatory program to certify wheat shipments were free of 
fungal disease after a Karnal bunt outbreak in the United States.\63\ 
Recent research suggests that the Environmental Protection Agency 
scientific integrity and transparency failures related to pesticide use 
have eroded global trust and are undermining U.S. agricultural 
exports.\64\

    If Russia succeeds in taking global wheat export markets from the 
United States, American farmers will undoubtedly be threatened. With 
less market access and increasing input costs, the incentive for 
growing the preeminent American staple crop would dwindle, resulting in 
lower output and production capacity. Such an outcome, combined with 
other disruptive options identified in this essay, could accelerate 
Russian aims of undermining U.S. global power.
Disruption Option 4: Agricultural Bioterrorism
    Another vector for attacking U.S. wheat production, and one 
carrying potentially the broadest impact, would be a Russian attack 
involving pests or pathogens designed to damage crops. Such an attack 
would likely be done covertly to provide plausible deniability. Before 
the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention of 1972 (BWC), several 
countries, including the United States, developed and maintained 
offensive biological weapons research programs.
    Many historians and scientists claim that while other signatories 
to the BWC ceased their offensive biological weapons programs after the 
convention went into effect in 1975, the Soviet Union secretly 
continued its program despite being a signatory to the treaty. Research 
has shown that the Soviet program was the longest and most 
sophisticated the world has ever seen, beginning in 1928 and lasting 
until at least 1992. Its scope was massive, involving over 65,000 
workers.\65\ A specific component of Soviet biological warfare research 
operated under the code name Ekologiya and focused on developing 
pathogens that would kill animals and plants, including crops such as 
wheat. It eventually became the largest ever offensive biowarfare 
project focused specifically on agriculture.\66\

    Should the Russians choose to conduct a biological attack against 
American grain crops, wheat rust could likely be the weapon of choice. 
Wheat rusts are a type of fungus belonging to the genus Puccinia that 
can affect different parts of the wheat plant. Also known as ``the 
polio of agriculture,'' it has been the worst wheat disease in history, 
capable of causing catastrophic crop failures. During the first half of 
the 20th century, rust destroyed \1/5\ of America's wheat crops in 
periodic epidemics.\67\ Before the BWC outlawed offensive biowarfare 
programs, many countries sought to weaponize wheat rust because of its 
potent effects in targeting crops. Relative to other biological agents, 
it remains viable for an extended period of time under cool storage (2 
years) and spreads quickly after release.\68\ In addition, plant rust 
fungal spores are easily dispersed, durable to withstand transportation 
and transmission, and easy to produce in sufficient quantities. If the 
specific variety of targeted wheat is known, attackers could use 
tailored strains of wheat rust that would have the greatest likelihood 
of successfully killing and spreading while protecting their own crop 
with specific strain-resistant varieties.\69\

    According to some claims, the Soviet program did not stockpile 
anti-agricultural weapons like wheat rust but maintained several 
facilities ``equipped as mobilization capacities, to rapidly convert to 
weapons production should the need arise.'' \70\ A historian of the 
Ekologiya program described one of the project's main facilities as 
possessing the world's largest ``unique collection of fungal pathogens 
against wheat.'' \71\ Another facility, the Scientific Research 
Agricultural Institute in Gvardeyskiy, Kazakhstan, was reportedly a key 
testing site for newly developed anticrop (including antiwheat) 
pathogens in greenhouses measuring a total area of 100 square 
meters.\72\ In total, four separate program facilities maintained 
laboratories focusing on rust species research.\73\

    Project Ekologiya has several implications for the security of U.S. 
wheat production today. First, the Russian Federation inherited the 
offensive Soviet biological weapons program and its decades of 
research, development, and technological capability. While the Kremlin 
claims the program ended after the Cold War and that it has since 
complied with the BWC, the United States argues otherwise. In 2021, the 
State Department reported the following: ``The United States assesses 
that the Russian Federation maintains an offensive BW program and is in 
violation of its obligation under Articles I and II of the BWC. The 
issue of compliance by Russia with the BWC has been of concern for many 
years.'' \74\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Not only is there a possibility Russia has maintained a biological 
weapons program with agricultural components, but a second implication 
for U.S. national security is that conventional American farming is 
potentially vulnerable to biological attack because intensive farming, 
as practiced today, ``involves limited diversification of crop and 
cultivar genetics over large areas,'' helping create ``an ideal 
environment'' for new pest establishment and spread.\75\ As small, 
diversified farms have been overtaken by today's larger farming 
operations for the sake of profit and efficiency, the United States has 
inadvertently made its crops potentially more vulnerable to biological 
attack. Some experts note that pests and the plant diseases they can 
carry would be ``an ideal means of waging `asymmetric' war'' in 
scenarios that fall below the threshold of conventional armed 
conflict.\76\

    Exacerbating the problem is that our germplasm seed banks are 
potentially insufficient in possessing the diversity required to 
rebound from a devastating biological event. New varieties with 
resistance would be essential in a successful attack scenario because 
wheat rust can persist over the winter and remain viable to infect the 
following year's crop. During the Cold War, germplasm collections were 
better stocked and more robust to ensure resilience against known 
pathogens. Those efforts have fallen behind in recent decades.\77\ For 
example, a new strain of wheat stem rust emerged in Uganda in 1998, 
commonly known as Ug99.\78\ Since then, scientists have evaluated 
roughly 200,000 wheat varieties for natural resistance to Ug99. Less 
than ten percent demonstrated adequate resistance.\79\ Not until 2017 
did researchers discover a gene that provided resistance to Ug99, 
making it possible to develop wheat varieties naturally capable of 
surviving the disease.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    It should be noted that debate exists around the degree of risk 
posed by a supposed lack of biodiversity. Some wheat pathology experts 
argue that concerns of insufficient biodiversity in American wheat 
crops are overblown. While wheat as a species is a monoculture grown in 
vast quantities across the United States, there are many dozens of 
commercial wheat varieties grown today, providing a reasonable degree 
of genetic diversity within the species to mitigate massive impacts 
from disease or pest outbreaks.\80\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Although fungi are the most likely form of intentional biological 
threat to wheat due to the relatively ease with which they can multiply 
and spread, other pathogens like viruses and bacteria can also affect 
grain crops. Defending against viruses is problematic. Treatments 
against viruses are generally not as effective as using chemicals to 
control fungi and bacteria. Disturbingly, the Soviet biowarfare program 
reportedly included a facility based in Uzbekistan, the Central Asian 
Scientific-Research Institute of Phytopathology, that ``focused on 
viral diseases of wheat.'' \81\ These claims are corroborated by a 
declassified 1977 U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency report stating that 
the Soviet antiplant biowarfare program conducted work on wheat and 
barley mosaic streak viruses.\82\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Another intentional wheat industry disruption scenario could 
involve the malicious introduction of wheat parasites that carry 
harmful bacteria. For example, Rathayibacter tritici is a bacterium 
that infects wheat via parasitic nematodes to cause a toxic gumming 
disease.\83\ While not currently present in the United States, 
introducing the associated nematode vectors to American wheat crops 
could at least result in wheat export quarantines, as trade partners 
would balk at accepting potentially contaminated grain shipments.\84\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Biological attack against wheat production could also be an 
attractive objective for an adversary like Russia because of the costs 
imposed by recovery. Pests and pathogens can disperse and reproduce at 
dramatic rates, providing the potential to wreak havoc across vast 
amounts of American farmland. For example, a small outbreak of Karnal 
bunt in the American Southwest in 1996 resulted in $250 million in 
damages.\85\ In Texas, the cost of mitigating effects on agriculture 
from nonnative fire ants is more than $1.2 billion annually. Expenses 
for protecting crops from a nonnative insect carrying Pierce's Disease 
that has plagued California grapevines since 1989 are also 
substantial.\86\ Beyond just the recovery costs, pathogen outbreaks 
could also easily lead to trade embargoes as destination countries 
resist the risk of importing contaminated U.S. wheat. Thus, a 
widespread infestation damaging American wheat crops ``could lead to 
potential economic losses of immense proportions.'' \87\ A former 
member of the Soviet biological weapons program agreed, citing 
antiagricultural biological weapons as ``particularly suitable'' for 
disrupting a target country's economy.\88\

    Intentional infestations targeting agriculture for nefarious 
purposes are not without precedent. Analysts strongly suspect manmade 
causes behind a debilitating outbreak of the fungus Moniliophthor 
perniciosa, also known as witches' broom disease, among cocoa fields of 
Bahia, Brazil, beginning in 1989.\89\ Potentially motivated by the 
perpetrator's desire to destroy the chocolate industry to punish its 
wealthy landowners, the suspected attack nearly exterminated the area's 
cocoa plantations over the following decade. By 2001, ``Brazil went 
from being the world's third-leading cocoa producer to being the 
13th.'' \90\ Given this potential for covert bioterrorism to exact 
large economic costs to a country's agricultural industry, Russia could 
consider it as an increasingly attractive option as strategic 
competition with the United States escalates.

Risk Analysis
    Risk is a function of likelihood and consequence and can be 
mathematically described as Risk = Likelihood of an Event  Consequence 
(loss due to the event).\91\ To aid in measuring likelihood and 
consequence of the four attack strategies Russia could employ to target 
U.S. wheat production, an expert survey was conducted. Data was 
collected from 30 participants in the United States who are 
professionals with expertise in fields related to the wheat industry, 
including farming, academia, information technology, and global trade. 
Due to the potential security concerns of identifying the experts in 
the survey, it was decided that all participants would remain 
anonymous. The survey asked each participant to assess the likelihood 
and consequences of the four Russian disruption scenarios: cyber 
attacks targeting grain infrastructure, restricting fertilizer exports, 
undercutting U.S. wheat exports, and agricultural bioterrorism.\92\ 
Participants assessed the likelihood of each scenario using a 5-point 
Likert scale converted to the following percentages to enable 
calculations (table 2). Participants assessed consequence using the 
following 5-point Likert scale based on expected economic losses 
ranging from less than $1 million to more than $20 billion (table 3). 
Survey results for likelihood and consequence are captured in figures 3 
and 4 and risk scores are presented in figure 5. Calculated mean scores 
for likelihood and consequence for each attack scenario are found in 
table 4.

term price manipulations or subsidies to domestic wheat production to

Note: Numbers are rounded.

    Further refinement of the results was conducted to ultimately 
generate a more robust measurement of overall risk for each scenario. 
To calculate an overall likelihood percentage, the sum of response 
percentage values (as shown in table 2) was divided by the total 
available percentage of all responses. To calculate the dollar value 
associated with the overall consequence score, the mean score for each 
scenario was assessed as a percentile within the associated dollar 
range (as shown in table 3).
    To then calculate the final risk for each scenario, the calculated 
likelihood percentage was multiplied by the consequence dollar value to 
determine the overall amount of risk in terms of dollar cost, as shown 
in table 5.
    Limitations in this study include those intrinsic to Likert scale 
surveys (for example, not able to capture all opinions, subjective 
results, etc.) and the small sample size of expert participants. 
Another limitation of this study is the inherent biases of the 
participants who come from a range of professional backgrounds related 
to the wheat industry. Therefore, deeper analysis is needed to provide 
more robust risk measurements of wheat industry disruption scenarios. 
Still, results from this survey point to potential prioritization in 
policy considerations to address the threat of potential Russian 
disruption of the U.S. wheat industry.
Cultivating Resilience
    The United States must act to ensure resilience of domestic wheat 
production, storage, and transportation to mitigate the risks outlined 
above. First, additional research is needed to measure domestic food 
security risks more accurately. A Likert survey of experts like the one 
conducted in this study that encompasses a greater number of experts 
and uses finer granularity in the scales would be beneficial. A Delphi 
study could also serve to identify a stronger consensus of risk to the 
U.S. wheat industry from potential Russian action.\93\ Beyond improving 
the survey, policymakers and wheat industry leaders should consider the 
following measures, which are listed in prioritized order to address 
risks from highest to lowest based on the expert survey results shared 
above.

    USDA: Proactively Defend Against Biological Warfare Targeting Crops 
by Ensuring Sufficient Genetic Diversity of American Grains. Industrial 
wheat breeding has helped increase yields over the past century, but 
some argue that this has come at the expense of genetic diversity: 
``Modern breeding techniques narrowed the genetic base of germplasm 
used to develop varieties for cultivation.'' \94\ Genetic uniformity in 
modern wheat crops means greater potential vulnerability to new 
pathogens. Ensuring a source of genetic variation in wheat is essential 
for disease resistance. Landrace wheats play a vital role in doing so. 
Landraces are premodern grains that developed naturally over millennia 
while adapting to local environmental conditions. Many landraces were 
lost during the 20th century as farmers abandoned them in favor of 
modern varieties championed in the Green Revolution.\95\ Due to their 
wide variety, landraces do not possess the genetic bottleneck of modern 
hybrid wheats.

    Landraces typically produce yields lower than modern wheats, which 
can seemingly put them at odds with rising global food demands. 
Nevertheless, they serve a critical role in preserving genetic 
diversity to ensure American wheat crop resilience should new pathogens 
wreak havoc on modern varieties. It is also worth noting that landrace 
wheats are reported to have better yields and higher quality attributes 
than modern varieties ``under organic and low-input farming systems.''

    Landraces can and have been preserved in seed banks, which is 
worthwhile, but there are limitations in preserving them this way. 
Landraces are heterogeneous, meaning that individual specimens of the 
plant's spikes stored in banks do not necessarily possess all the 
genetic diversity in the landrace variety. In addition, most biologists 
agree that active cultivation of landraces is essential to preserve 
cultivation knowledge.\97\ Given these circumstances, USDA should find 
ways to collaborate with American farmers and researchers to 
incentivize and ensure sufficient production levels of landrace wheats.

    USDA and DHS: Prepare for Adequate Response to Biological Attack 
Against U.S. Wheat Crops. USDA-National Institute of Food and 
Agriculture and the Department of Homeland Security established the 
National Plant Diagnostic Network (NPDN) during growing fears of 
bioterrorism following 9/11 and the 2001 anthrax attacks.\98\ The NPDN 
serves as a network of diagnostics laboratories across the country that 
help rapidly identify plant disease and pest outbreaks. Since its 
establishment, funding and support for the NPDN have begun to 
erode.\99\ As the original sponsoring agencies, USDA and DHS should 
evaluate the current state of the program to make sure its capabilities 
are sufficiently resourced to perform adequate early monitoring and 
detection of a biological attack against domestic crops.

Network, see https://www.npdn.org/.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In addition to shoring up early warning capabilities, USDA should 
also review the agriculture industry's preparedness to respond to 
bioterrorism. If an outbreak of disease against U.S. wheat crops 
occurs, agrochemical suppliers will need to deliver treatments to limit 
damage. However, supply chains for pesticides can be brittle, as was 
the case during the COVID-19 pandemic.\100\ Further analysis of 
domestic pesticide treatment inventories and supply chains would help 
identify what is needed to boost the resilience of U.S. farms in a 
worst-case scenario.

    USDA: Pursue and Encourage Alternatives to Conventional Fertilizer. 
The American wheat industry's reliance on conventional fertilizer has 
become increasingly challenging due to rising prices, global supply 
disruptions, and environmental costs. Greater emphasis is needed on 
adopting renewable fertilizers. While multiple solutions may be 
required to fill the gap, transitioning American agriculture to a more 
sustainable and regenerative approach is key.\101\ The Biden 
Administration has tried moving on this front and recently announced 
$500 million in funding for boosting domestic fertilizer production 
that is ``independent, innovative, and sustainable.'' \102\ This effort 
is worthwhile to help transition the United States off foreign 
fertilizer dependence. It does not, however, preclude the need to 
continue transitioning to more sustainable and regenerative 
agriculture.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \101\ According to the USDA, sustainable agriculture is defined as 
practices that ``are intended to protect the environment, expand the 
Earth's natural resource base, and maintain and improve soil 
fertility.'' For more information, see ``Sustainable Agriculture,'' 
USDA, https://www.nifa.usda.gov/topics/sustainable-agriculture.

September 27, 2022, https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2022/09/
27/biden-harris-administration-makes-500-million-available-increase.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    One facet of sustainable agriculture that would help provide a 
viable alternative to synthetic fertilizers is the greater use of cover 
crops. Growing the same monoculture crop in the same field for years on 
end, as most conventional U.S. farmers do, damages the soil microbiome 
as the same nutrients are depleted over time. Conventional agriculture 
deals with this problem by applying large amounts of synthetic 
fertilizer to the soil. When cover crops are added to crop rotation, 
the cover crop plants naturally fertilize and rejuvenate soil health. 
Furthermore, a growing body of scientific research shows that yields 
from sustainable agricultural systems are comparable to that of 
conventional systems.\103\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \103\ For a summary of this research, see The Fertilizer Trap: The 
Rising Cost of Farming's Addiction to Chemical Fertilizers 
(Minneapolis: Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, November 8, 
2022), 11, https://www.iatp.org/the-fertiliser-trap.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The downside to cover crops is the inability to grow a desired crop 
(for example, wheat) for that growing season, which would reduce 
overall American wheat output. Options exist to compensate for drops in 
annual grain yields that would result from the broader use of cover 
crops. Addressing all options is beyond the scope of this essay, but 
one example is choosing cover crops that can act as cash crops that 
produce food and simultaneously amend the soil. An example of this 
would be cover crop legumes, which fix nitrogen to the soil that would 
be available for the next season's wheat.
    Funding is another limiting factor and will be necessary to 
incentivize American farmers to widely adopt the use of cover crops. 
Sustainable agriculture receives little government funding compared to 
industrial agriculture. The most recent farm bill (a package of 
legislation Congress passes every 5 years to support U.S. agriculture) 
provided less than seven percent of its funding for conservation 
practices.\104\ USDA can increase funding for cover crop implementation 
by reducing farm bill spending in other areas overdue for adjustment, 
like conventional corn subsidies.\105\

    USDA: Establish a National Strategic Grain Reserve. As previously 
noted, if Russia succeeded in some capacity to disrupt U.S. wheat 
production, resulting in domestic grain shortages, no current national 
wheat reserve exists to reduce the ensuing effects. Given how essential 
grain is to the U.S. food supply and the increasing probability of 
climate change's impact on global grain production, a strategic grain 
reserve makes sense. The need for a reserve has risen in recent times. 
For instance, droughts in 2012 affected corn production to such an 
extent that the United States had to import corn from Brazil, a 
surprising development for America as the world's leading corn 
producer.\106\ Converting any remaining funds within the Bill Emerson 
Humanitarian Trust into a physical grain reserve and supplementing it 
by redirecting funding from conventional commodity crop subsidies could 
provide this much-needed resilience in our national food security.

    State and Commerce Departments: Encourage Import-Dependent 
Countries to Boost Domestic Food Production to Minimize Exposure to 
Russian Grain Trade Manipulation. Having export markets available to 
American wheat not only can be lucrative for farmers and commodity 
traders but also can undermine efforts in those destination countries 
to develop greater self-sufficiency in food production. The United 
States will always need to produce more wheat than it consumes on 
average because this helps buffer against the effects of unforeseen 
production shortfalls regardless of the cause. It also assists trade 
partners in meeting their food requirements when they experience 
unexpected shortages or find themselves in positions where they cannot 
realistically become fully self-sufficient in their own food 
production. However, in a world where Russia is a global food power and 
can use inputs and commodities as weapons to win concessions, allies 
and partners should be encouraged to reduce their dependence on foreign 
food sources. Although this could reduce U.S. wheat exports in the long 
run, it would, more importantly, mitigate Russia's ability to exploit 
vulnerable countries to enhance their Great Power status.
    DHS: Harden Information and Operational Technology Networks Used 
for Grain Production, Storage, and Transportation. Cyber security 
remains a challenge for organizations across all industries, but 
implications for breaches to critical infrastructure networks such as 
those in the grain industry are more severe and require greater 
attention to ensure proper security practices. For wheat industry 
organizations' information technology and operational technology 
networks, like other industries, known best practices provide the 
greatest defense against cyber attacks. However, many businesses fail 
to implement the full range of best practices due to limitations in 
understanding and the failure of company executives to invest 
appropriately in network defense.
    Wheat industry leaders can leverage the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology cyber-security framework for guidance.\107\ 
Taking this proactive approach to network defense will limit exposure 
to disruptive intrusions like the ransomware attacks that recently 
plagued Midwestern grain elevators.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion
    As a rival in strategic competition and as the emerging food 
superpower, Russia is uniquely positioned to disrupt U.S. wheat 
production, storage, and delivery. Moscow has already demonstrated its 
intentions to attack U.S. interests in adversarial competition at 
levels below armed conflict, and future attempts to do so could 
realistically involve targeting the American wheat industry. As the 
most important food staple in America, wheat supply degradation could 
have significant consequences for domestic food security and, by 
extension, trust in the U.S. Government. Should Russia pursue such a 
strategy, its tactics could range from cyber attacks on grain 
infrastructure to manipulating global fertilizer and wheat export 
markets to covert antiagriculture biowarfare.
    To mitigate these threats, American policymakers should consider a 
range of policy options. First, further research is needed to measure 
risks of Russian disruption to the U.S. wheat industry. Results would 
more accurately prioritize policy considerations. In the meantime, 
prioritized policy considerations should include:

  <bullet> improving biodiversity in U.S. wheat production

  <bullet> ensuring sufficient resourcing for detection and response to 
        a biological attack against U.S. crops

  <bullet> enhancing sustainable agriculture to reduce dependence on 
        imported fertilizer

  <bullet> establishing a national grain reserve

  <bullet> reducing global exposure to Russian grain trade manipulation

  <bullet> encouraging the improved implementation of cyber security 
        best practices throughout the wheat industry.

    With an increased focus on reducing food system vulnerabilities, 
U.S. leaders and the world's citizens can reap a harvest of improved 
global security. JFQ

October 2023

    Explosive growth in productivity over the last 100 years--coupled 
with extraordinary innovation in mechanization--has meant that fewer 
and fewer people are needed to feed, clothe, and fuel our nation. 
Perhaps no one has captured this sentiment better than U.S. Secretary 
of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, when at a Congressional hearing in February 
2016 he said:

          ``Every one of us that is not a farmer is not a farmer 
        because we have farmers. We delegate the responsibility of 
        feeding our families to a relatively small percentage of this 
        country. If you look at 85 percent of what is grown in this 
        country, it is raised by 200,000 to 300,000 people. That is 
        less than \1/10\ of 1 percent of America.
          ``But the other 99 percent of us can be lawyers and doctors 
        and Peace Corps volunteers and economists and people that work 
        for government and all of the other occupations because we 
        never think about, well, gee, do I have to actually grow the 
        food for my family? No. I go to the grocery store and get it.
          ``So, I am free to do whatever I want to do with my life. 
        That is an incredible freedom that we take for granted in this 
        country. It is not true in most of the countries in this world. 
        And then when we go to the grocery store, we walk out of it 
        with more money in our pocket as a percentage of our paychecks 
        than anybody else in the world.'' \1\

    The U.S. has been on this path of fewer but larger farms since the 
beginning of the last century. Data from the 1920 Census indicated 
there were 6,448,343 farms with an average farm size of 148.2 acres.\2\ 
According to the 2017 Census of Agriculture, in 2017 there were 
2,042,220 farms with an average farm size of 441 acres.\3\ Not only has 
average farm size been growing, it is also resulting in a shift in the 
composition of farms. One of the pioneers in all of agricultural 
economics, Earl Heady, from Iowa State University, predicted this 40 
years ago:

          ``We are heading towards a bimodal farm distribution wherein 
        we will have a rather large number of part-time, retirement, 
        and similar farms where it is not chiefly size economies which 
        tie them to the land, but the utility they realize from the set 
        of satisfaction derived from country living and a smaller 
        number of larger farms which dominate the nation's food and 
        fiber production.'' \4\

Center for Agricultural and Rural Development.

    Heady's observations have materialized as reflected in Figure 1. 
According to USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS), ``Most farms are 
small, but the majority of production is on larger farms.'' \5\ ERS 
also noted that small-scale operators depend on off-farm income while 
large-scale farms derive almost all of their income from the farm. It 
is important to note here that 98% of farms, irrespective of size, are 
family owned and operated. ERS has observed that most of the 
``nonfamily'' enterprises operate in high-value specialty crops (e.g., 
wine grapes) that are not impacted by Title [I] farm program payment 
limits (although they too are impacted by payment limits on other 
programs, most notably ad hoc disaster assistance). Moreover, many in 
the ``small'' and even ``midsize'' category are in fact part-time, 
retirement, or lifestyle farms that fundamentally do not rely upon the 
farm income to continue.

    Heady's observations also have significant policy implications. 
Namely, who is the farm bill--and the farm safety net in particular--
intended to benefit? In remarks during a March 16, 2023, hearing before 
the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, Secretary 
Vilsack testified that ``our policies have ensured an increasingly 
abundant food supply, growth in farm size and consolidation has put 
extreme economic pressure on small and medium sized farms and our rural 
communities . . . . We must ask ourselves: do we want a system that 
continues to force the big to get bigger and the small and underserved 
to get out or do we want a build a more innovative system?''
    This statement by Secretary Vilsack appears to be a reaction to the 
answer to a question from a reporter by President Trump's Secretary of 
Agriculture, Sonny Perdue at the World Dairy Expo in Madison, Wisconsin 
on October 1, 2019. It was reported he said ``get big or get out'', 
however transcripts from the event indicate the reporter used this 
quote in a follow-up question rather than being said by Secretary 
Perdue. Secretary Perdue's quote that was labeled ``get big or get 
out'' is summarized below.\6\

          ``The 2018 Farm Bill will stem the flow of that. Now, what we 
        see obviously, is economy of scale having happen[ed] in 
        America, big get bigger and small go out, and that's kind of 
        what we've seen here. It's very difficult in the economy of

    The United States has grappled with this small-farm versus large-
farm debate for decades. Congress has invested a significant amount of 
resources in helping small, beginning, socially-disadvantaged, limited 
resource, and veteran producers get started in production agriculture. 
Congress has also significantly curtailed access to the farm safety net 
via means testing, actively engaged determinations, and payment limits. 
In this report, we delve into these topics, examining economies of size 
in production agriculture and exploring the implications of payment 
limits in particular.
Economies-of-Size in Agriculture: An Economic Review
    The topic of economies-of-size in agriculture is one of the most 
researched areas in agricultural economics (Madden; \7\ Shertz; \8\ 
Hall and LeVeen \9\). In general, economies-of-size studies have 
attempted to discern the relationships between the size of a firm and 
the unit cost of a commodity (Harrington).\10\ Anyone who studies 
production economics or economics in general has been trained that all 
cost relationships can be expressed in terms of unit cost curves of a 
single or composite product for various firm sizes. This is important 
because the long-run average cost (LRAC) curve is the envelope of the 
short-run average cost (SRAC) curves (Figure 2).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Most agricultural economists have been trained that the shape of 
the LRAC curve is more in line with Figure 3, meaning that there is a 
range of output where it is beneficial to a producer to increase 
output. There has always been the thought that the LRAC curve turns up 
at some level of output (seen in Figure 3) making it less profitable to 
continue to increase size.
    Recent studies indicate that the LRAC cost curve may actually be L 
shaped which would mean that farm economics would dictate greater 
expansion of output does not result in lower per unit profits (Duffy; 
\11\ Hallam \12\). It is also difficult to blame farmers for increasing 
the size of their operations given that productivity growth is the 
principal factor responsible for 80 percent of the sector's post-war 
growth (Pardey and Alston).\13\

    In a summary by USDA-ERS economists, structural change in livestock 
production facilitated productivity growth, cost reduction, and 
increased international competitiveness, while in crops, labor-saving 
substitution and technical change have been important.\14\ Nigel Key 
(also with USDA-ERS) found that larger farms in the Midwest are more 
productive than smaller farms.\15\ In addition, he found that policies 
focused on large farms would have increased aggregate total factor 
productivity more than 32 times more than similar policies targeting 
the smallest farms. His results support the notion that it is the 
increase in size that has kept the U.S. in its place as a low-cost 
producer of corn and soybeans.

    By any account, increasing efficiency and size has also facilitated 
enormous increases in productivity, with the benefit accruing to 
consumers. Perhaps it has become trite to say the U.S. food supply is 
the safest, most abundant, and most affordable in the world, but it is 
an important truth, and it is inexorably connected to the productivity 
of U.S. farms.
Economies-of-Size and Profitability
    The percent of farms and land in farms gathered in the ARMS survey 
and published by USDA is presented in Table 1 by sales class. Many have 
seen this data so often that we are numbed to the implications of what 
the economic sales class means. This means that farms that sell between 
$1,000 and $9,999 represent 51 percent of all farms and work a little 
more than nine percent of the land. What gets lost in this is that 
sales class is a very different thing from farm profit.

    The actual profit margin (what is left after expenses are paid) in 
U.S. agriculture varies by crop, year, and farm. As noted by 
Langemeier, the profit margin for Western Indiana corn growers averaged 
6% over the 2015-19 period and was projected to be 3.6% and 3.4%, 
respectively for 2020 and 2021.\16\ Even if you assume a more 
optimistic 10% profit margin on $100,000 annual gross sales for a farm, 
that only leaves $10,000 profit for the farm in a year.

    Table 2 takes the data from Table 1 and multiplies the economic 
sales classes by 10% to translate into a proxy for farm profits. While 
each individual has their own level of income they would need to live 
on from farming, it is quite apparent that you have to get close to 
$500,000 in sales to return a profit level that would be in the area of 
what most would call a living wage (or $50,000). While this example 
would yield a living wage (by this definition), that is far from the 
full story. To be clear, we are talking about a scenario where $500,000 
is being put at risk--and crop production is a very risky enterprise--
in hopes of earning $50,000.
    It should be clear that those ``farmers'' operating with receipts 
that are not capable of sustaining their families rely upon outside 
sources for income. In most cases, these are people who are living 
their best life as described by Earl Heady above. Why does it matter? 
It doesn't as long as policies are not designed to reward those living 
a lifestyle while hurting those actually trying to earn a living from 
agriculture.

Economies-of-Size and Terms of Trade
    There is another facet to economies-of-size that needs to be 
considered in this discussion. When producers of a commodity are known 
as the low-cost producer, this generally goes hand-in-hand with having 
taken advantage of economies-of-size to lower production costs. 
Economies-of-size can affect international competitiveness and changes 
in terms of trade (Hallam).\17\

    Even though farmers in the U.S. have been consolidating and 
increasing the size and scale of operations, the share of exports for 
many commodities has been declining as countries around the world 
increase the size and scale of their operations in order to compete 
with U.S. farmers. Figure 4 shows how the U.S. share of world trade has 
declined over the past 50 years. Even with a tremendous boost in 
productivity in the U.S., the share of world exports has declined for 
most of the major crops.
    So what? Think of what would have happened if the United States 
hadn't been consolidating and becoming more completive on the LRAC cost 
curve. The results would be considerably worse, both for American 
producers (in terms of market share) and for consumers world-wide.

    Consider the loss in share relative to Brazil's increase in trade 
shares for corn and soybeans (Figures 5 and 6). Brazil currently 
exports more corn and soybeans than the United States; however, this is 
a new phenomenon in corn while Brazil's trade share surpassed the U.S. 
for soybeans somewhere around 2015. There are plenty of economic and 
policy reasons why this has occurred, including their relatively small 
domestic use of corn and soybeans, but one additional thing to consider 
is the relative size of operations in Brazil (and the relationship 
between size and cost competitiveness). Figure 7 provides a comparison 
of the percentage of farms by size in each of the countries. More 
research is needed here; however, it is interesting and noteworthy that 
in Brazil nearly 50 percent of their operations are over 1,000 acres, 
while in the United States 50 percent of the operations are below 100 
acres.

Policy Considerations
    The farm safety net--including the permanent disaster programs--are 
all based on per-unit or per-acre payment rates that scale with the 
size of losses. This makes sense given that mitigating risk is the 
underlying purpose of these programs. While payments are calculated 
based on the magnitude of the loss, payment limits are then applied as 
a final step before USDA issues payments. Importantly, payment limits 
do not entitle a producer to a payment of that magnitude; rather, it 
simply limits the amount of losses for which the producer can receive 
assistance--meaning that any losses exceeding the payment limit are 
borne entirely by the producer.
History of Payment Limits
    Payment limits first appeared in the 1938 Farm Bill, limiting 
producers to $10,000 per person per year. Modern-day payment limits 
trace their roots to the 1970 Farm Bill, which implemented a $55,000 
payment limit for each of the annual programs for wheat, feed grains, 
and cotton in crop years 1971, 1972, and 1973--for an effective payment 
limit of $165,000 if producers grew all three crops. The 2018 Farm Bill 
imposes a limit of $125,000 per person or legal entity (with the 
exception of joint ventures and general partnerships) for ARC and PLC. 
Several other programs are also subject to payment limits as noted in 
Table 3.

    While payment limits have historically been focused on Title [I], 
the 1981 Farm Bill added a $100,000 limit for disaster payments for 
wheat, feed grains, upland cotton, and rice for each of the 1982 
through 1985 crop years. More recently, the 2014 Farm Bill established 
permanent baseline for several disaster programs, including the 
Livestock Forage Program (LFP), the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, 
Honeybees and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP), the Livestock Indemnity 
Program (LIP), and the Tree Assistance Program (TAP). While all of 
these were initially payment limited in some form, following successive 
natural disasters, Congress has chosen to relax the payment limitations 
for these programs, as reflected in Table 4.

Payment Limits in Context
    Have payment limits kept up with inflation?

    As noted above, modern-day payment limits trace their roots to the 
1970 Farm Bill with a $55,000 payment limit for each of the annual 
programs for wheat, feed grains, and cotton in crop years 1971, 1972, 
and 1973. Figure 8 illustrates the magnitude of that payment limit 
($55,000 for a single program/crop) were it in place today and indexed 
for inflation. In fact, that $55,000 payment limit would be $413,247 
today, more than three times larger than the current combined payment 
limit of $125,000 per person or legal entity applying to all covered 
commodities eligible for ARC and PLC. If the limits from the 1970 Farm 
Bill were combined for a producer growing all three crops (i.e., 
$165,000), the payment limit today would be just over $1.2 million. 
Again, this doesn't mean a producer is entitled to a payment of $1.2 
million; it simply means that any losses up to $1.2 million could be 
covered. Instead, under current law, any losses beyond $125,000 are 
borne entirely by the producer.

        Inflation

    Aren't payment limits good for small farms?

    While we've long heard arguments that payment limits help smaller 
producers, evidence of that actually being the case is harder to come 
by. Instead, payment limits tend to simply limit support available for 
larger producers. There are certainly exceptions. In the case of ad hoc 
assistance that is provided as a finite amount of funding allocated to 
USDA--for example, the funding provided for implementing the Emergency 
Relief Program--the payment limit could funnel more support to smaller 
producers by leaving larger full-time producers to face more exposure 
on their own. But, importantly, in the farm bill debate, these 
arguments that payment limits help small producers really hold very 
little water. We examined CBO scores for the last several farm bills 
and see virtually no case where the imposition of payment limits freed 
up significant additional funding for programmatic improvements for 
smaller farms.

    With means testing and actively engaged requirements, what purpose 
does the payment limit serve?

    USDA dedicates 558 pages in its ``short reference'' to explaining 
eligibility rules and limitations. Importantly, producers must qualify 
as actively engaged in farming to be eligible for assistance, including 
(1) making a significant contribution to the farming operation of 
capital, equipment, or land, or a combination thereof; (2) making a 
significant contribution to the farming operation of active personal 
labor, active personal management, or a combination thereof; (3) 
sharing in the profits or losses from the farming operation at a level 
that is commensurate with the person or entity's contributions to the 
operation; and (4) their contributions to the farming operation must be 
at risk for loss, with the level of risk commensurate with the person 
or entity's claimed share of the farming operation. Beyond that, 
producers must also certify that their 3 year average Adjusted Gross 
Income (AGI) is less than $900,000 to be eligible for programs like ARC 
and PLC. With these provisions in place, what purpose does the payment 
limit serve? Beyond that, in light of the focus on risk management, 
this question becomes even more acute. On the one hand, Congress is 
providing tools to help producers mitigate risk; on the other, they are 
completely undermining those tools with payment limits that become even 
more binding as the losses mount, a topic we explore in detail in the 
following section.
Effectiveness of Payment Limits
    In the 2014 Farm Bill, Congress abandoned the Direct Payment 
program, which made decoupled payments to producers regardless of 
market conditions. Unfortunately, this shift in policy focus to the 
provision of risk management tools did not come with a corresponding 
discussion on the appropriate role of payment limitations. For example, 
if producers only receive assistance when they face market losses, does 
it make sense to apply a payment limit that completely undermines the 
efficacy of the programs themselves (especially in light of all of the 
other requirements that a producer must meet to be eligible in the 
first place).
    In fact, the payment limit is a regressive policy tool. As the loss 
grows deeper, the payment limit results in a smaller and smaller share 
of the loss being indemnified, as illustrated in Figures 9 through 11 
and Tables 5 through 7 for wheat, corn, and cotton, respectively. For 
example, in Figure 9, if the marketing year average price for wheat is 
$5.33/bu (or 3% below the $5.50/bu Reference Price for wheat) and 
assuming a 41.5 bu/ac yield (equal to the national average PLC yield) 
along with an 85% payment factor, the $125,000 payment limit would 
allow for a full payment on over 20,000 acres. What if the loss is 
deeper--say a marketing year average price of $4.13/bu (or half-way 
between the Reference Price and Loan Rate for wheat)? In that case, a 
producer would be limited to support on just 2,571 acres.
    This is illustrated even more clearly in Table 5. If the average 
wheat price for the marketing year fell to $2.94/bu (equal to the Loan 
Rate), the payment limit would have the effect of reducing support by 
91% compared to what producers would have otherwise received on a 
15,000 acre operation. But, that only impacts large farms right? Well, 
in fact, a fairly small- to standard-sized wheat operation of 3,000 
acres would see their support reduced by more than 50% due to the 
payment limit. So, the idea that the payment limit protects smaller- or 
mid-sized operations just doesn't add up. To add insult to injury, the 
payment limit is most binding when the support is most needed.
    As noted in Figure 12 and Table 8, this dynamic is even more 
pronounced for ARC. Using corn as an example, we assume a county 
average yield of 180 bu/ac and project the crop year 2025 benchmark 
average price using the latest WASDE price forecast. At a marketing 
year average price of $3.64/bu (which would barely trigger a payment 
under PLC), a 3,000 acre corn farm enrolled in ARC would be limited to 
support on just 890 acres. The payment limit would have the effect of 
reducing support by 70% compared to what producers would have otherwise 
received in that scenario.

Payment Limit Considerations in the Next Farm Bill
  <bullet> Given other checks and balances, are payment limits even 
        needed? Arguably, if the objective is ensuring that assistance 
        is not provided to those who are not actively engaged (or at 
        risk) in farming or to those who are high-income individuals, 
        the United States already has tools in place to prevent those 
        individuals from qualifying--namely very robust means testing 
        and actively engaged determinations. To that end, it's 
        reasonable to argue that the payment limits make no sense at 
        all, particularly if the point of the farm safety net is to 
        make risk management tools available to producers who are not 
        otherwise disqualified.

  <bullet> Absent common-sense improvements to payment limits, the need 
        for ad hoc assistance will continue. It seems counterintuitive 
        to limit the assistance available via ARC or PLC only for 
        Congress to have to step in with ad hoc assistance. If a goal 
        of the next farm bill is to obviate the need for ad hoc 
        assistance, then expanding payment limits to fit the reality of 
        production in 2023 is warranted. Either the farm safety net is 
        designed to work for all growers or pressure will remain to 
        provide ad hoc assistance (subject to separate payment limits, 
        as has been the case for the last several years). If 
        policymakers want to avoid ad hoc assistance, then safety net 
        payments need to be proportional to loss.

  <bullet> Assistance in the farm safety net is already proportional to 
        losses. Long gone are the days where farmers get money simply 
        for being farmers. The safety net is now designed to provide 
        assistance only in times of loss when market returns are below 
        historic norms. As we've noted above, the payment limit 
        significantly impacts on the efficacy of this safety net 
        because of its regressive effect. There is a wisdom in letting 
        payment size scale with losses.

  <bullet> Payment limits should be adjusted to reflect inflation and 
        the long-run costs of farming. In the 1970s when the $165,000 
        payment limits were first introduced, a new cotton stripper or 
        grain harvester would have cost less than $50,000. Today, when 
        the combined limit is $125,000, such machines cost close to $1 
        million. For family businesses committed to farming, the 
        margins are incredibly thin considering the risks involved. In 
        some regions, the margins are thinner and the risks are 
        greater, meaning farms have grown larger to lower their average 
        costs and remain competitive. While a pure inflation index is 
        unlikely, the limits should be adjusted given this reality.

  <bullet> If payment limits remain, some common-sense improvements are 
        needed. While we think a conversation about eliminating payment 
        limits is warranted, we are under no illusion that is 
        politically feasible. With that said, recent disaster packages 
        have provided a roadmap for additional common-sense 
        improvements to payment limits in Title [I] of the next farm 
        bill. For example, flexibility with the permanent disaster 
        programs was highlighted in Table 4. In addition, the Wildfire 
        and Hurricane Indemnity Program Plus (WHIP+) imposed a payment 
        limitation of $125,000 per person or legal entity for all 3 
        crop years (2018, 2019 and 2020) but doubled the limit to 
        $250,000 for each of the crop years (with an overall limit of 
        $500,000 for all 3 crop years) if 75% of income was derived 
        from farming, ranching, or forestry.\18\ WHIP+ borrowed the 75% 
        waiver concept from a provision in the 2002 Farm Bill whereby a 
        producer was exempt from the AGI means test if more than 75% of 
        their income came from farming, ranching, or forestry. In 
        addition, the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) 
        applied the 75% waiver to an AGI means test of $900,000 and 
        imposed a payment limit of $250,000 which they allowed to 
        expand up to $750,000 depending on the number of individuals 
        involved in the entity and their contribution of active 
        personal management and active personal labor.\19\

Press Release
Three Sentenced to Prison for Conspiring to Steal USDA-Mortgaged Houses
Wednesday, December 20, 2023

For Immediate Release

U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of Mississippi

    Natchez, Miss.--Three individuals were sentenced for their 
respective roles in a scheme to steal houses from the United States 
Department of Agriculture.
    Barry Martin, 47, of Georgia was sentenced to 46 months in prison; 
Fiesta Kagler, 59, of Georgia, was sentenced to 46 months in prison; 
and Ella Martin, 69, of Jayess, Mississippi, a former USDA employee, 
was sentenced to 35 months in prison.
    According to court documents, the defendants conspired to identify 
and steal USDA-mortgaged properties. The targeted properties were 
mortgaged through the Brookhaven office of USDA Rural Development, an 
agency which helps rural residents buy or rent safe, affordable 
housing, especially low and very low income individuals. As an employee 
of that office, Ella Martin had access to a list of abandoned, 
foreclosed, nearly-foreclosed, or similarly distressed USDA-mortgaged 
properties and would create fraudulent warranty deeds designed to 
convey ownership of those properties to her co-conspirators and others. 
The fraudulent deeds included forged signatures from former homeowners, 
including at least one deceased individual. The fraudulent deeds were 
then filed in Chancery Courts around Mississippi with the intent to 
deprive the actual owners of the use and benefit of the properties and 
to deprive the United States Government of the actual value of the 
properties.
    All three defendants will be required to pay restitution, which 
will be determined at a separate hearing.
    U.S. Attorney Todd W. Gee and Special Agent in Charge Dax Roberson 
of the USDA Office of the Inspector General (OIG) made the 
announcement.
    The USDA OIG and the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated 
the case.
    Assistant U.S. Attorney Kimberly T. Purdie prosecuted the case.

  Committee on Agriculture
  U.S. House of Representatives
  Washington, D.C.

    Dear Representative:

    On behalf of the 1.4 million members of the American Federation of 
State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and our members who 
administer benefits of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program 
(SNAP), I urge you to support and strengthen the structure, integrity 
and capacity of SNAP as you develop the farm bill.
    SNAP is a powerful and successful tool to ensure that all Americans 
can afford healthy food--it is a lifeline for 41 million Americans 
including students, veterans, disabled Americans, children, families 
and seniors. We note it is a safety net nutrition program, not an 
employment program. SNAP has been an effective tool to combat hunger, 
poverty and improve economic conditions for both individuals and 
communities. In communities, it serves as an economic engine, 
generating between $1.50 and $1.80 for every dollar invested.
    Beginning in March 2020, states and counties used temporary SNAP 
flexibility to provide emergency benefit supplements, maintain benefits 
to households with children missing school meals, and ease program 
administration during the pandemic. These options allowed states to 
deliver more food assistance to struggling families, helped manage 
intense administrative demands, and ensured that participants 
maintained much-needed benefits all while radically shifting their 
operations to respond to a public health emergency. In fiscal year (FY) 
2021, SNAP participation averaged 41.5 million beneficiaries, up by 
nearly 5.8 million over the pre-pandemic year FY 2019.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ https://frac.org/blog/new-data-snap-benefit-redemptions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    With these factors in mind, AFSCME recommends the following to 
strengthen SNAP:

    Ensure access to full SNAP benefits by preserving the merit-
staffing requirement for eligibility determination.

    AFSCME members who are SNAP state and county eligibility workers 
help constituents access nutrition benefits. Federal law requires that 
``merit staff'' public employees conduct the essential work of SNAP to 
screen for eligibility and determine benefit levels. This includes 
providing application assistance, answering client questions about 
missing information, pursuing missing information, and providing 
verification guidance. Merit staff are civil service government workers 
who act as honest brokers to deliver benefits and services 
professionally, efficiently and effectively. Merit systems at the 
Federal, state and local levels require hiring, advancement, demotion 
and discipline based on merit and competence. Merit staff conduct the 
people's business according to transparent standards, free from 
political influence and without fear of arbitrary management action or 
retaliation. Merit-based personnel systems are resilient and can help 
safeguard decisions to grant or deny an important nutrition Federal 
benefit from political whims.
    Merit staffing ensures that SNAP beneficiaries receive the help 
they need from a skilled professional workforce, that recipient data 
remains private, and that eligibility determinations are based on 
qualifications rather than profit or other motives.
    AFSCME strongly opposes allowing states to expand non-merit staff 
for SNAP administration, including allowing states to contract out 
staffing to record or accept client information, conduct interviews and 
handle client complaints regarding case eligibility and benefits. 
Congress should not permit states to hire non-merit staff to screen for 
eligibility, provide application assistance, answer client questions 
about missing information, pursue missing information, and provide 
verification guidance. We oppose permanent, expanded changes such as 
those proposed in the Emergency SNAP Staffing Flexibility Act of 2021 
(H.R. 6203) because it would decimate merit-staffing requirements, 
undermine program integrity and waste limited taxpayer resources.
    Experiments with the outsourcing of merit-staffed work in Texas and 
Indiana proved to be a waste of taxpayer dollars and a drain on good, 
local jobs that pay better than privateers who rarely provide essential 
benefits, including health care and retirement.\2\ Outsourcing has 
resulted in none of the promises of improved performance, efficiency or 
cost savings. In fact, it has harmed struggling families, seniors and 
the disabled, and compromised the integrity of the program itself. As 
Stacy Dean, Deputy Under [S]ecretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer 
Services, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), noted in 
testimony before the House Agriculture Committee's hearing in 2022, 
these harmful impacts were ``disastrous and ended up making service 
worse and states had to pull back from it. So experience would suggest 
it's a pretty risky endeavor to shift the roles as we've experienced 
them for the past 4 decades.''

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Increase necessary administrative funds.

    It is essential that SNAP has adequate program staff to determine 
eligibility in a timely manner so that families can access the 
nutrition assistance they need. In April 2023, the impact of the 
pandemic on the state and local government workforce remained acute, 
with states and towns struggling to fill 833,000 open positions. In 
addition, many merit staff who make SNAP eligibility decisions also 
work on Medicaid eligibility determinations. The unwinding from the 
public health emergency resulted in an unprecedented increase in 
workload responsibilities and warrants additional workforce training 
and resources. AFSCME recommends increasing the administrative match 
for SNAP from 50% to 75%. This increase will help pay competitive 
wages, provide adequate training and support workers to prevent 
backlogs, and improve consumers' access to needed benefits.

    Allow administrative flexibilities, not outsourcing, to improve 
efficiency.

    During the pandemic flexibilities that improved the consumer 
experience included easing interview requirements, streamlining methods 
for electronic signatures, extending certification periods and 
simplifying reporting requirements. These should be allowed to 
continue. Administrative flexibility is not privatization or 
outsourcing. We oppose proposals to waive merit staffing, for example, 
during pandemics and other health emergencies, seasonal workforce 
cycles, temporary staffing shortages, and weather or other natural 
disasters. Given the current staffing shortage, the focus should be on 
strengthening the program in a sustainable way that upholds its 
integrity and access.
    SNAP is a countercyclical program designed to respond to periods of 
high demand and adjust when demand wanes. As such, program 
administration should also be designed to accommodate these cycles.

    Extend SNAP's entitlement structure to Puerto Rico and other U.S. 
Territories.

    U.S. Territories, including Puerto Rico, receive a capped block 
grant from the Nutritional Assistance Program (NAP). This structure is 
unlike SNAP and the program is not able to serve all eligible people 
who apply. Other major Federal nutrition programs--including the 
Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children 
(WIC) and child nutrition programs including school meals programs--
operate the same in Puerto Rico as in the states. We urge you to 
provide the U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico with full access to the SNAP 
program and not the block grant under NAP.
Summary
    Thank you for your efforts to continue to ensure that SNAP meets 
the needs of those in need and is administered by professional, merit-
staffed state and county employees. We are counting on you to maintain 
current SNAP merit-staffing requirements to fully enable the program's 
ability to serve our nation's most vulnerable families.
            Sincerely,

    Dear Chairwoman DeLauro, Chairman Leahy, Ranking Member Granger and 
Vice Chairman Shelby:

    We write to respectfully request your assistance with securing 
additional funds for the Nutrition Assistance Program (PAN) as you 
continue working towards reaching a deal for the Fiscal Year 2022 
omnibus spending bill.
    As you are aware, Puerto Rico does not participate in the national 
Supplemental [Nutrition] Assistance Program (SNAP). Instead, Puerto 
Rico has NAP, a capped block grant that currently serves over 1.5 
million of my constituents. Due to limited funding, we have had to turn 
to Congress on multiple [occasions] seeking an [increase] in funds to 
accommodate changes in demand related to emergencies, including the 
ongoing COVID-19 emergency.
    Most recently, Section 1103 of the American Rescue Plan, Public Law 
117-2, provided $1 billion for nutrition assistance programs in Puerto 
Rico, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands.\1\ Of these, 
Puerto Rico obtained $966,120,000, which are set to expire in June 
2022. Unless Congress appropriates additional funds for NAP, Puerto 
Rico will revert back to the base block grant amount while still 
grappling with the pandemic.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    To help mitigate the challenges [stemming] from the pandemic, as 
well as serving needy constituents during these trying times, we 
respectfully request the amount of $1 billion for the NAP program to 
continue providing assistance to needy families during the emergency 
period. As we work towards a transition to SNAP, we must secure 
resources that will get us support the imminent need in Puerto Rico.
            Sincerely,

Insert 1
          Mrs. Cammack. . . .
          So, specifically, what is USDA doing to ensure that American-
        grown products are being served in American schools? And is 
        there a requirement for American-grown products to be used in 
        schools?
          Secretary Vilsack. There is a requirement that food that we 
        purchase has to be produced and processed and every aspect of 
        it being done in the U.S.
          Mrs. Cammack. Okay. Now, what are you doing to ensure that 
        that is in fact happening? Because, as I have just laid out, we 
        are finding products from all over the world, from Russia and 
        China, et cetera, in our school systems.
          Secretary Vilsack. Well, if you want to give us information 
        about the specific schools, we will be more than happy to take 
        a look at that specific circumstance. We have a process in 
        which we, through our Food Nutrition Service, do the best we 
        can to ensure that the purchases are being made are consistent 
        with the rules and regulations of FNS.
          Mrs. Cammack. So I will tell you what, by the end of the 
        quarter, you and I can have a conversation, and I will make 
        sure my team gets the data to yours, and we can go through 
        that.

    USDA would welcome any specific data.
Insert 2
          Ms. De La Cruz.--Mr. Secretary, because it is such an 
        important issue. And like my colleague across the aisle said, 
        we don't want to play partisan politics with our farmers and 
        ranchers. Food security is national security, and I would like 
        your commitment to stand with me and our farmers and ranchers 
        and meet with and talk with Secretary Blinken about Mexico's 
        lack of abiding to the 1944 treaty. Can I have your commitment 
        to stand with the ranchers and farmers and speak to Secretary 
        Blinken about this treaty?
          Secretary Vilsack. I am happy to take a look and learn more 
        about this and get back to you, Congresswoman. I think that is 
        fair.

    USDA is committed to support efforts of the U.S. Department of 
State as needed.
Insert 3
          Mr. Van Orden. . . .
          . . . One of the efforts USDA offers is the Dairy Business 
        Innovation Initiative .
          * * * * *
          Secretary Vilsack. And they make decisions based on where 
        those resources need to be allocated.
          Mr. Van Orden. Okay.
          Secretary Vilsack. So they would have the information in 
        terms of the number of grants and specific investments.
          Mr. Van Orden. Okay.
          Secretary Vilsack. So, we don't control--once we give the 
        resources to the innovation center, it is the innovation center 
        that makes the determination.
          Mr. Van Orden. So if we could get that information from these 
        guys later, or if you could help us do that, I would appreciate 
        it greatly.
          * * * * *
          Mr. Van Orden.. . . Many of my constituents are asking the 
        USDA to use their emergency powers to change the dairy pricing 
        formula from the ``average of'' to the ``higher of.'' No one 
        has testified in opposition to changing this formula. The USDA 
        is considering making the change through the FMMO hearing 
        process that just concluded. We talked about that. 
        Unfortunately, they are on step 5 of 12 in the process. Dairy 
        farmers can't wait till 2025. Do you support accelerating this 
        process?
          Secretary Vilsack. I am not prepared to answer that question 
        because I need to have a better understanding of exactly what 
        you are asking.

    The Federal Milk Marketing Order (FMMO) program regulates organic 
and conventional milk identically because the Agricultural Marketing 
Agreement Act of 1937, as amended, classifies milk based on form and 
use, not on farm production method. FMMOs require conventional and 
organic milk processors to pay the same classified price for milk based 
on its end use--fluid milk, soft products, or storable products.
    A proposal was submitted to treat organic milk differently within 
the FMMOs during the request for proposals in June 2023, in 
anticipation of the August 2023 hearing. Because the hearing was 
related to pricing formulas, the organic milk proposal was excluded 
from the hearing notice, a decision the Administrative Law Judge 
presiding over the hearing upheld.
    At any time, interested persons can submit a proposal to amend the 
FMMOs in accordance with the regulations at 7 CFR 900.3. All proposals 
should fully address the submission requirements outlined in 7 CFR 
900.22. Once a proposal has been submitted, USDA will consider the 
proposal and determine whether a hearing should be held.
Insert 4
          Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. . . .
          . . . I have heard from an alarming number of constituents 
        concerned about illegal vehicular camping occurring with the 
        Deschutes National Forest in my district. These activities are 
        not only taking away-from vital public resources from my 
        constituents, but also leading to lasting environmental damage. 
        Around Phil's Trailhead and along China Hat Road, there have 
        been numerous reports of unsanctioned bonfires, trash dumping, 
        and burning, drug usage, dumping of human waste, trespassing 
        onto adjacent private property, as well as violent crime 
        throughout.
          Not only is there a concern that there is no concrete plan of 
        action to address these concerns, but also I am told that local 
        volunteer organizations that are trying to work with the Forest 
        Service will no longer be deployed due to safety concerns. Do 
        you believe the current citation system is effective, or are 
        stronger enforcement mechanisms needed to ensure that those 
        that are trespassing will be held accountable and stop the 
        damage from getting worse?
          Secretary Vilsack. Well, I think we need to look into that 
        particular set of issues. I am more than happy to do that.

    The Deschutes National Forest (DNF) recognizes the challenges posed 
by unauthorized encampments and the associated environmental and public 
safety concerns. Addressing these issues is a high priority for the 
Forest Service, and we are actively working to mitigate the impacts in 
areas such as Phil's Trailhead and China Hat Road.
    Staff regularly patrol these areas, enforce regulations, and 
conduct clean-up operations to address issues such as trash dumping, 
unsanctioned fires, and natural resource damage. Homelessness, however, 
remains a complex societal issue that cannot be fully resolved by the 
Forest Service alone. We collaborate with local and Federal partners--
including the Deschutes County Sheriff's Office, City of Bend, and the 
Bureau of Land Management-on community-driven strategies to address the 
broader challenges of unauthorized encampments.
    To enhance our response, we are also focusing on fire prevention 
education, volunteer safety, and leveraging partnerships with 
organizations like the Public Land Stewards. Volunteer safety is 
paramount, and we ensure that no volunteers or employees are deployed 
in conditions where safety risks cannot be mitigated.
    Our enforcement capabilities are limited by law, which restricts 
our ability to remove individuals or their belongings without a Federal 
Magistrate's court order. While we continue to issue tickets for 
violations, these measures do not provide a direct mechanism for 
resolving long-term encampments.
    The current citation system provides a framework for addressing 
violations, but it has significant limitations in effectively deterring 
unauthorized long-term camping and mitigating its associated impacts. 
Issuing tickets for violations like resource damage or exceeding stay 
limits is a vital enforcement tool; however, it does not address the 
root causes of these encampments or provide immediate relief from the 
environmental and public safety issues your constituents have raised.
    More robust enforcement mechanisms may be necessary to ensure 
accountability and prevent further degradation of public lands. This 
could include policy changes that streamline the process for removing 
individuals and their property from unauthorized campsites when 
violations occur.

                          Submitted Questions
Response from Hon. Thomas ``Tom'' J. Vilsack, Secretary, U.S. 
        Department of Agriculture
Questions Submitted by Hon. Glenn Thompson, a Representative in 
        Congress from Pennsylvania
    Question 1. Many of the questions the current Dietary Guidelines 
Advisory Committee (DGAC) is studying are so granular that many are 
lacking sufficient evidence and, thus far, are having to be eliminated 
or are resulting in limited evidentiary conclusions. I am concerned 
this reality, as has happened with past DGACs, may result in the DGAC 
making recommendations based on analytical tools versus empirical 
evidence, such as food pattern modeling, that, while useful when 
studying consumption patterns, do not meet the evidentiary standard 
required for the Dietary Guidelines to establish nutrient or food group 
recommendations. How will USDA ensure that DGAC recommendations are 
based solely on dietary reference intakes and other proper scientific 
evidence rather than unproven tools as they seek to comment on the 
preponderance of the scientific evidence as required by statute?
    Answer. The 2025 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) is 
charged with reviewing the scientific evidence on nutrition and health 
to develop a scientific report for HHS and USDA, which will provide 
advice and recommendations to help inform the development of the 
Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2025-2030. To examine the evidence, 
the Committee is using three approaches: data analysis, food pattern 
modeling, and systematic reviews. Each approach has its own rigorous, 
protocol-driven methodology, and plays a unique, complementary role in 
examining the science.
    The 2025 DGAC's work in food pattern modeling explores the types of 
flexibilities that may or may not exist in dietary patterns. Of note, 
the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) 
recommended the Secretaries of USDA and HHS ``enhance food pattern 
modeling to better reflect the complex interactions involved, 
variability in intakes, and range of possible healthful diets''. The 
2025 DGAC's expanded food pattern modeling analyses, including a new 
analytic approach to diet simulations, are responsive to the NASEM 
recommendations for advancing the Dietary Guidelines development 
process.
    The food pattern modeling analysis involves hypothetical scenarios 
specifically related to ensuring the dietary patterns included in the 
Committee's advice meet the Dietary Reference Intakes, but this 
analysis alone does not equate to advice. The findings of the food 
pattern modeling analyses will be synthesized and put into context 
related to the Committee's findings from systematic reviews and data 
analyses. Findings from all three approaches will inform the 
Committee's advice and recommendations to HHS and USDA in its 
scientific report.

    Question 2. Federal spending on USDA FNS' Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program (SNAP) totaled over $110 billion in 2023. Currently, 
when a retailer store is audited, receipts are manually hand reviewed, 
a time-consuming and inefficient procedure. Recognizing this challenge, 
I understand USDA is conducting a Proof of Concept (POC) that uses 
Optical Character Recognition (OCR), an application of artificial 
intelligence. This initiative aims to streamline the auditing process 
by automating the review of a sample (limited to 1000) of FNS receipt 
and invoice data. FNS uses this data to demonstrate how the existing 
manual process can be automated, saving staff time, ensuring accurate 
review, and detecting difficult patterns. The goal of this POC will 
pave the way for a review system that (1) has an automated workflow and 
learns from analyst feedback (2) can incorporate known SNAP fraud 
patterns, identify new fraud patterns, and visualize alerts on these 
patterns on retailer invoices and receipts. Can you provide an update 
on the POC and any plans for scaling this effort into a fully 
operational production system that ensures SNAP funds are going only to 
families in need?
    Answer. SNAP integrity is of the utmost importance to USDA and 
continues to be one of the USDA Food and Nutrition Service's (FNS) most 
critical responsibilities. In the oversight of more than 260,000 
participating retailers, FNS constantly strives to deter and root out 
all types of fraud in SNAP. FNS continually looks to innovate and 
strives to stay ahead of bad actors who would violate program rules by 
utilizing the latest anti-fraud technology and techniques. The Proof of 
Concept (POC) for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is anticipated to 
begin testing by the end of Spring 2024. In the event the POC 
demonstrates the anticipated efficiencies, full implementation would be 
pursued by the end of the calendar year As suggested, OCR technology 
introduces several opportunities to modernize practices and provide the 
agency with tools to strengthen Program Integrity initiatives.

    Question 3. The Department has stated they are supportive of all 
forms of fruits and vegetables in feeding programs yet, publicly 
continue to push the narrative that that ``fresh is best,'' more 
beneficial, and that if you aren't serving or eating fresh, you're not 
eating ``healthy.'' For example, in 2023, GusNIP awarded 86% of its 
grant funding to fresh-only programs, and in November 2023, the 
Department put out this press release \1\ * equating fresh food to 
healthy and cheaper foods to less healthy. ``USDA is delivering on its 
promise to bolster food and nutrition security for underserved 
communities,'' said USDA Chief Scientist and Under Secretary for 
Research, Education and Economics Dr. Chavonda Jacobs-Young. 
``Investments like this enable people to afford and eat healthy fresh 
fruits and vegetables so they don't have to make a choice between 
healthy eating and cheaper less healthier options.'' The goal of many 
of these feeding programs is to increase nutrition access and reduce 
food insecurity by meeting families where they are, and the reality is, 
sometimes fresh produce may not be feasible or available. In fact, 
research shows that when a consumer has access to all forms of fruits 
and vegetables, consumption increases. What is the department doing to 
educate and help consumers understand the value of including additional 
forms of produce in their diet, and for example, how frozen can fit 
into a healthy lifestyle? As these are taxpayer-funded feeding 
programs, frozen can be a cost-effective option, especially since its 
long shelf-life results in less food wasted, thus extending recipients 
dollars. What is the department doing to work with the GusNIP TA center 
to encourage grocers to promote frozen as a choice for all consumers?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Answer. All foods have a place in a healthy dietary pattern. Across 
the NIFA portfolio of grant programs, Congressional authorizing 
legislation may emphasize specific crops or food groups, and may also 
provide National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) with broad 
discretion when implementing grant programs. As one example, the 
authorization for the GusNIP Produce Prescription Program, 7 U.S.C. 
7517(c), directs that to be eligible to receive a grant, projects must 
prescribe fresh fruits and vegetables.
    The legislative language for the GusNIP Nutrition Incentive 
Program, 7 U.S.C. 7517(b), provides NIFA with broad discretion to 
support projects that increase the purchase of fruits and vegetables. 
In the GusNIP Nutrition Incentive Program, fruits and vegetables are 
defined as any variety of frozen, canned, dried, or fresh; whole or cut 
fruits and vegetables; without added sugars, fats or oils, and salt 
(i.e., sodium).

    Question 4. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided the 
U.S. Forest Service over $2.8 billion for the National Forest System to 
carry out wildfire risk reduction and ecosystem restoration activities. 
You've had nearly 3 years to begin implementation and I've been hearing 
from various constituents that it is not making its way to the ground. 
Can you share with us how many communities you've protected with the 
hazardous fuels reduction projects, like installing fuel breaks, as 
authorized in IIJA? How many acres have been treated using the 
emergency authority?
    Answer. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) provided $1.4 
billion for hazardous fuels treatments, of which we will have allocated 
$848M by the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2024. The Forest Service and 
partners are making significant progress in implementing the Wildfire 
Crisis Strategy. Since the rollout of the strategy, we have now 
invested in the treatment of over a million acres across the 21 
Wildfire Crisis Strategy landscapes alone and accomplished 4.4 million 
acres of hazardous fuel treatments across the entire National Forest 
System (NFS) last year, an all-time record in the agency's history. Our 
work under the strategy is beginning to reduce risk to approximately 
550 communities, 2,500 miles of power lines, and 1,800 municipal 
watersheds, as well as many other values the public depends on and 
cares about.
    Since the passage of the BIL, USDA has exercised the emergency 
authority that Congress provided in the law to provide for more 
efficient forest management decisions in emergency circumstances and we 
have designated over 27 million acres of NFS lands for expedited 
analysis, decision-making, and implementation. Since that time, the US 
Forest Service has approved 43 emergency actions covering up to 1.2 
million acres. Thirty-seven projects are currently being reviewed and 
are at various stages of completion. Six projects have signed decisions 
authorizing up to 295,605 acres with implementation underway. As of 
this hearing we have completed treatments on approximately 24,000 acres 
using the emergency authority.
    With continued investments from Congress, we will be able to build 
upon the work we have already accomplished. USDA is committed to 
continuing to ramp up the pace and scale of our hazardous fuel 
reduction and forest management treatments to confront the crisis, 
using every tool and authority at our disposal. We must also continue 
to find ways to invest in our wildland firefighters, who are not only 
critical to our suppression activities but also for fuels management 
work on a year-round basis. It is important that we have resources that 
go to our land and forests, as well as the people who protect them.

    Question 5. As you know, a robust timber industry is critical to 
addressing the wildfire crisis. However, we continue to see declining 
levels of timber harvest across the National Forest System. Based on 
information we received from the U.S. Forest Service, over 80 units 
failed to meet their timber targets over the last 5 years. Mr. 
Secretary, can you please tell us how you are working diligently to 
increase the level of timber volume sold across National Forest System 
lands?
    Answer. In FY 2023, the Forest Service demonstrated its commitment 
to forest resilience and local economies by selling 3.144 billion board 
feet (BBF) of timber (5,894 thousand hundred cubic feet (MCF)), marking 
one of the highest output periods in recent decades. The agency has 
sold an average of 3.08 BBF (5,730 MCCF) annually over the past 5 
years. In FY 2023, the Forest Service sold 246 MCF of biomass, 
maintaining an average annual sale of 228 MCF over the past 6 years.

    Question 5a. The U.S. Forest Service received significant 
investments from the IRA and IIJA. Can you please provide the Committee 
with a detailed breakdown of which projects have included timber 
harvests?
    Answer. Multiple provisions of the Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act benefit our timber management 
program. These funds are additive to our already existing program of 
work and act as a force multiplier to accomplish more on-the-ground 
activities so that we can have a robust timber sale pipeline into the 
future. Funds from IIJA/IRA are used to perform such activities as NEPA 
planning, sale designation and marking, and numerous other presale 
activities that contribute to the pipeline of timber sales across the 
agency. We do not track IRA and IIJA funding specific to timber 
harvests.

    Question 6. Mr. Secretary, I think we all operate under the 
impression that Categorial Exclusions allow projects to go from 
proposal to completion faster given the lack of environmental effects. 
However, I continue to hear from my constituents that projects using 
Categorial Exclusions have taken years to complete. For example, in 
Region One, one project using a CE took more than 4 years to compete 
and another took more than 6 years. Can you explain to us why projects, 
especially those that are less than 3,000 acres, can take a half decade 
or more to complete?
    Can you tell me what the U.S. Forest Service is doing to avoid 
lengthy delays throughout the project planning process?
    Answer. From Fiscal Years 2019-23, the Forest Service averaged 146 
days to complete a Categorial Exclusions (CE). This time is less than 
the 158 day average it took the Forest Service to complete a CE in 
Fiscal Years 2014-18. The Forest Service is getting faster at 
completing CEs. There will be outliers in any large data set that bring 
with them unique situations and requirements, especially given that the 
Forest Service completes over 1,000 CEs annually. Projects occasionally 
are put on hold for a variety of reasons, such as shifting priorities, 
intervening events like wildfires, or at times upon the request of the 
project applicant.
    We are incorporating efficiencies at every stage of the planning 
process. The Forest Service's focus is on training, information 
sharing, community building, standardization, contracting, use of 
additional CE categories, CE adoption under the new Section 109 of 
NEPA, determination of NEPA adequacy, and programmatic agreements in 
order to expedite the review.

    Question 7. Mr. Secretary, it is well known that compliance with 
the Cottonwood decision is actively delaying hazardous fuel treatments, 
keeping the potential for dangerous wildfires higher, for longer. We've 
heard from the U.S. Forest Service that adhering to the Cottonwood 
decision will force current forest restoration projects to pause for 5 
to 10 years and cost the agency millions of dollars in re-consultation 
fees. Further, the Obama Administration is on record stating that a 
finalized forest plan is not an ongoing action and does not allow for 
discretionary involvement. Can you confirm that it is your position 
that a statutory fix for the Cottonwood decision is needed?
    Answer. Prior to the passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act 
of 2018 (P.L. 115-141) in which Congress provided the Forest Service a 
temporary safe harbor from Cottonwood-related litigation, forest 
restoration projects were expected to be delayed for 5-10 years and 
cost the agency millions of dollars in re-consultation efforts. Since 
the expiration of the initial five-year safe harbor provision in March 
2023, the Forest Service has faced-s and continues to face increased 
litigation risks and potential project implementation delays. The 
Forest Service continues to spend time and resources addressing plan-
level consultation and working to develop Biological Assessments for 
various species. The Forest Service's recent experience concerning 
plan-level reiniations has been that such reinitiation efforts 
typically do not result in any change to Land Management Plan (LMP) 
direction or additional conservation benefits beyond what is reflected 
in the reinitiation of consultation that occurs for ongoing projects.
    The Forest Service has not delayed any restoration projects since 
passage of the 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act solely because of 
failure to reconsult on newly listed species at a plan level. After a 
LMP is revised and associated consultation occurs, the Forest Service 
continues to perform project-level consultation for all existing and 
newly listed species and critical habitats and feels this is the 
appropriate level of consultation that should be undertaken.
    USDA continues to highlight the importance of the National Forest 
Management Act's incremental decision-making process for periodic and 
project-specific decision-making with the Services and the great 
ecological benefit such an approach can have. The Forest Service also 
continues to highlight the implications of Cottonwood-style litigation 
that could hinder the accomplishment of the administration's broader 
natural resource management objectives. USDA continues to seek out 
solutions that will allow for timely decision-making, while maintaining 
the important wildlife protections afforded by the Endangered Species 
Act and would welcome the opportunity to work with Congress on a 
legislative language related to Cottonwood.

    Question 7a. In your view, how has the Cottonwood decision made 
western communities more vulnerable to wildfire?
    Answer. During the initial 5 year safe harbor provision the Forest 
Service did not face a risk of delayed forest restoration projects 
solely because of failure to reinitiate plan-level consultation 
regarding newly listed species or critical habitat. The social, human, 
and environmental effects of proposed projects and activities continue 
to be analyzed at the project level, including any necessary 
reinitiation of consultation.

    Question 8. Mr. Secretary, it is my understanding that litigation 
has impacted timber sales across the National Forest System with over 
1.8 billion board feet impacted. 1.8 billion board feet is enough 
timber to build over 100,000 single family homes. Is that correct?
    Answer. Yes.

    Question 8a. Can you tell me what the U.S. Forest Service is doing 
to avoid litigation?
    Answer. The Forest Service strives to operate in a collaborative 
manner to reduce litigation. The pre-decisional administrative review 
(``objections'') process also helps to resolve conflicts and reduce 
litigation. The Agency provides training based on new and existing case 
law to provide support to employees and improve the quality of our 
project planning and decision-making and ultimately be more successful 
when litigated. Additionally, we engage with partner agencies in 
information sharing and project support to ensure there is a consistent 
approach to project planning.

    Question 9. A concern I often hear about is that agencies provide 
excessively detailed NEPA analyses to ensure their decisions will not 
be litigated. Mr. Secretary, can you provide us with an update on the 
department's compliance with the amendments to NEPA from the Fiscal 
Responsibility Act of 2023?
    How has the department streamlined environmental documentation as a 
result? Have you complied with the new deadlines as outlined in Section 
107(g)?
    Answer. The Forest Service is complying with the requirements of 
Sections 106, 107, 108, 109, and 111 of NEPA, where applicable. The 
Agency engaged with the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) in 2023 
to share information on E-NEPA (Section 110).
    The Forest Service is focused on compliance with Section 109 (CE 
Adoption). We are currently consulting with seven Federal agencies 
regarding the adoption or lending of 18 CE categories. The CE 
categories the Forest Service is seeking to adopt will assist with 
compliance for broadband infrastructure support, telecommunications, 
range and grazing operations, mining support activities, and 
transportation projects.
    For example, The Department of Commerce has several CE categories 
for which the Forest Service is requesting adoption, which will allow 
telecommunication infrastructure to be documented with a CE vs. an EA. 
This could reduce the timeline for environmental compliance for some 
telecommunication projects by over a year. In addition, it was recently 
announced that the Bureau of Land Management is adopting a permit 
streamlining policy already in use by the Forest Service and the Navy 
that will help BLM to approve geothermal exploration projects faster. 
The Forest Service is currently gathering information in support of 
reporting EAs and EISs that exceed deadlines associated with Section 
107(g) of the FRA.

    Question 10. Recently, the U.S. Forest Service initiated an 
unprecedented effort to review and amend all land management plans for 
units of the National Forest System, 128 plans in total, to ``include 
consistent direction to conserve and steward existing and recruit 
future old-growth forest conditions and to monitor their condition . . 
.''. Mr. Secretary, what has been the leading cause of loss of ``old 
growth'' forests over the last 2 decades? How does amending these 
forest plans address the biggest threat to ``old growth'' forests? How 
will this policy help the U.S. Forest Service implement this 
Administration's own 10 year Wildfire Crisis Strategy, which calls for 
a three-fold increase in forest restoration projects?
    What portion of the newly identified ``old growth'' forests are 
already included in roadless and/or wilderness areas? Do current forest 
plans already contain provisions and restrictions regarding ``old 
growth'' conservation?
    Answer. According to our recently completed Threat Analysis, the 
biggest threats to old growth over the past 2 decades have been 
wildfires (^712,000 acres), insects, and diseases (^182,000 acres). The 
proposed amendment would implement strategies to foster resiliency to 
these threats and drive proactive stewardship and forest management 
actions to retain old-growth forest conditions across national forests/
grasslands and complement the agency's wildfire crisis strategy. 
Healthy, climate-resilient old-growth forests store large amounts of 
carbon, increase biodiversity, reduce wildfire risks, enable 
subsistence and cultural uses, provide outdoor recreational 
opportunities, and promote sustainable local economic development.
    Land management plans are made up of a suite of plan components 
designed to address a multiple-use framework to ensure ecological 
integrity, and to provide for social and economic sustainability. Many 
land management plans throughout the National Forest System contain 
plan components that speak to the management of old-growth forest 
conditions and reflect the management objectives and desired conditions 
of a particular forest or grassland. This results in a multitude of 
approaches toward the management of old-growth forest conditions.
    The table below shows estimates of old-growth forests across 
various special land designations. On Forest Service-administered land 
about 55% of the old growth is in wilderness or inventoried roadless 
and about 45% is in general forest. For the BLM about 20% is in 
wilderness and inventoried roadless. See the table below for more 
details.

    Question 11. USDA's Climate Risk Viewer identifies several ways in 
which climate resiliency is already incorporated in USFS planning and 
NEPA. Secretary Vilsack, what specific gaps in existing policy and 
practices have you identified that fail to address the risks and 
threats to old growth? Additionally, under the proposed action how will 
the U.S. Forest Service balance other environmental aspects, namely 
enhancing and conserving wildlife habitat, that may not be analogous 
with old growth directives?
    Answer. It may be the case that, in some circumstances, existing 
old-growth policies and practices are effectively conserving old-growth 
conditions in the face of climate-induced threats. Putting a national 
framework in place that is responsive to local conditions/diversity is 
the logical step to take to validate and improve status quo management. 
The mature and old growth Threat Analysis highlighted the need for 
additional proactive stewardship actions to protect mature and old 
growth under certain conditions. In other situations, no action is 
needed. We are continuing to analyze the Threat Analysis and Inventory 
to develop guidance on identifying situations in which management 
actions are appropriate. The Agency will use the National Environmental 
Policy Act environmental impact statement process to evaluate the 
potential impact of the proposed action and alternatives on relevant 
resource issues, such as wildlife habitat.

    Question 12. Mr. Secretary, the U.S. Forest Service has over 27,000 
permanent employees--with over 26,000 in regional and field offices. 
I've heard from my constituents that these field offices are still not 
adequately staffed, despite guidance from the White House that the 
agencies must return to the office. Can you please tell us how you 
monitor whether employees in the field are returning to the office? 
What measures are in place to ensure the information you receive is 
accurate?
    Can you please provide the Committee with the management direction 
the U.S. Forest Service has provided its employees regarding returning 
to the office?
    Answer. As with most managerial matters, first-line supervisors are 
responsible for ensuring that their team members know the location of 
their duty station and the requirements for performing their duties in 
person. Employees and supervisors are also responsible for entering 
their hours worked in the agency's time and attendance system based on 
the location of their work. For Forest Service employees assigned to 
public-facing positions (such as a ranger station), the duty station in 
most instances is the location of the public-facing position. In those 
types of positions, most of the employee's duties may be performed only 
onsite, where direct, in-person communications can occur between 
members of the public and the employee. Approximately 80% of Forest 
Service employees are currently working in person at their duty 
stations.
    As before the pandemic, Forest Service employees must receive prior 
written approval from their supervisors for some type of leave, such as 
sick or annual leave, to be absent from their duty stations. Forest 
Service supervisors can readily verify that in-person personnel are 
reporting to their duty locations as required, using essentially the 
same procedures as before the pandemic. At the start of each day, 
supervisors ensure that their team members are present and accounted 
for at their duty stations. Typically, the process involves seeing team 
members at their assigned desks, during check-ins, and regularly 
scheduled meetings. Forest Service management has informed public-
facing personnel, e.g., those who routinely interact with the public, 
that they need to report to their duty stations on a regular basis. As 
a result of this policy, over 80% of Forest Service personnel are 
performing their duties in person, just as they were pre-pandemic. 
Forest Service management has also informed personnel assigned to the 
Washington Office that regular in-person attendance is required and has 
directed supervisors to coordinate their employees' in-person and 
telework days to maximize in-person collaboration.

    Question 13. The National Forest System, established under the 
Organic Administration Act of 1897, was designed to allow for 
multifaceted economic use of lands within the system, including water 
conservation and the provision of a continuous timber supply. The U.S. 
Supreme Court and subsequent Congressional actions have reinforced this 
multi-use principle, emphasizing that national forests are to be 
managed for a variety of uses, not solely for preservation purposes.
    Given the critical role of national forests in supplying valuable 
mineral and energy resources, which contribute significantly to the 
U.S. economy and job growth, it is imperative that land management 
plans foster rather than hinder access to these resources. Especially 
in light of the current mineral supply chain challenges and energy 
reliability concerns, ensuring access to these resources is paramount 
for national security and economic stability. Can you assure us that 
the updates to the USFS land management rule will not obstruct the 
exploration, development, and utilization of mineral and energy 
resources on National Forest System lands, thus maintaining the forest 
system's economic and strategic contributions to the nation?
    Answer. It is our understanding that your question refers to the 
proposed National Old Growth Amendment for the Conservation and 
Stewardship of Old Growth Forest Conditions. The proposed amendment is 
not a Federal Rulemaking but rather is a proposed amendment to all 128 
Land Management Plans throughout the National Forest System. The intent 
is to foster the long-term resilience of old-growth forest conditions 
and their contributions to social, economic, and ecological 
sustainability across the National Forest System as part of the 
agency's overall multiple-use and sustained-yield mission. The proposed 
amendment contains proposed plan components to prevent the degradation 
of old-growth conditions and to enable conservation and proactive 
stewardship within old-growth forest conditions. The amendment is 
expected to operate prospectively, will not impact valid existing 
rights, and will comply with all applicable statutes and regulations, 
including those related to mineral and energy development.

    Question 14. Currently, the U.S. economy is heavily reliant on 
foreign sources for many minerals. Permitting delays have exacerbated 
the problem. These delays plague the minerals industry throughout 
project development, but there is a unique difficulty on U.S. Forest 
Service lands because early-stage, small-scale exploration activities 
must be authorized through a plan of operations as opposed to a more 
streamlined notice-level process as allowed by the USFS' sister land 
management agency, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Under 43 CFR 
Subpart 3809, BLM utilizes a 15 day timeframe for determining whether a 
notice is complete, and the operator may conduct notice-level 
operations once it has submitted the required financial guarantee. In 
contrast, exploration projects on USFS lands can wait years to secure 
necessary approvals. Does the Forest Service intend to promote 
consistency with the BLM when the agency updates its locatable mineral 
regulations later this year?
    Answer. Yes, the Forest Service is seeking consistency with the 
BLM. The Forest Service is currently undergoing a regulatory revision 
of 36 CFR 228A, which governs the occupancy and use of National Forest 
lands in connection with mining--including prospecting, exploration, 
development, mining, processing, and reclamation. These regulations 
have not seen any significant revisions since they were adopted in 
1974. As a result, there are many inconsistencies with the BLM's 3809 
regulations. One of the many goals the Forest Service has in 
modernizing these regulations is to bridge the gap between the BLM 3809 
regulations and the Forest Service 228A, which includes clear criteria 
for when notice-level operations can occur or when a plan of operations 
is required. The Forest Service anticipates this regulatory change will 
facilitate the efficient process of over 240 operations each year.

    Question 15. On December 5, 2023, the Administration released the 
Draft National Strategy for Reducing Food Loss and Waste and Recycling 
Organics. Despite the immense contributions of the rendering industry 
in preventing and diverting wasted food from disposal, with more than 
54 billion pounds of organic loss and waste upcycled by renderers each 
year, the Draft National Strategy did not mention rendering a single 
time. Secretary Vilsack, can you explain to the Committee why rendering 
is omitted from your Draft National Strategy?
    How does the Administration expect to meet its goals of cutting 
food loss and waste in half, without rendering?
    Answer. On June 12, 2024, the Administration released the final 
National Strategy for Reducing Food Loss and Waste and Recycling 
Organics (National Strategy) after carefully reviewing the more than 
10,000 comments received in response to the draft Strategy. The 
National Strategy drives progress toward the National Food Loss and 
Waste Reduction Goal to reduce the loss and waste of food by fifty 
percent by 2030. USDA, EPA, and FDA appreciate the role that organics 
recycling, including rendering, plays in reducing food loss and waste. 
In response to comments on the draft Strategy, the final National 
Strategy includes a definition of rendering and added reference to 
rendering in Objective 3, ``Increase the recycling rate for all organic 
waste.'' We will be looking for additional opportunities to reference 
rendering's important role as a food waste management pathway.

    Question 16. There seems to be a trend of this Administration 
excluding rendering from its efforts to reduce food loss and waste. In 
October 2023, EPA scrapped its Food Recovery Hierarchy below and 
replaced it with a Wasted Food Scale, notably removing rendering from 
this framework. Secretary Vilsack, can you explain what input USDA 
provided to EPA in their transition from Food Recovery Hierarchy to 
Wasted Food Scale?
    Does the USDA support EPA's decision to remove rendering in the 
Wasted Food Scale?

        https://www.epa.gov/land-research/field-bin-environmental-
        impacts-us-food-waste-management-pathways.
    Answer. USDA was not involved in EPA's development of the Wasted 
Food Scale.

    Question 17. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has 
published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking title Potential 
Future Regulation for Emergency Release Notification Requirements for 
Animal Waste Air Emissions Under the Emergency Planning and Community 
Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). This proposal could reverse the 2019 rule 
that exempted reporting of animal waste air emissions which received 
wide support from the agriculture industry and first responders. 
Secretary Vilsack, how have you collaborated with the EPA as they 
consider a new rulemaking under EPCRA?
    How are you responding to the small producers concerns about this 
proposal's additional burdens on their operations?
    Answer. USDA continues to provide an advisory perspective on 
agricultural matters before the EPA. I will note that the biggest 
complaints that I hear from small livestock producers are making sure 
that we are ensuring a level playing field, creating more processing 
capacity, and fighting industry consolidation that is striping profits 
from our livestock producers.

    Question 18. Research and promotion programs--commonly referred to 
as checkoffs--promote and provide valuable research and information for 
the commodity they cover. These programs are voluntarily created by 
producers, financed by producers, and directed by producers through 
their boards. We have recently seen unprecedented attacks by animal 
rights activists and anti-agriculture groups to dismantle checkoffs as 
we know them. Mr. Secretary, can you talk about how these programs are 
formed and discuss the oversight mechanisms the USDA Agricultural 
Marketing Service (AMS) enforces for checkoffs?
    Answer. Since 1966, Congress has authorized industry-funded 
research and promotion (R&P) boards to provide a framework for 
agricultural industries to pool their resources and combine efforts to 
develop new markets, strengthen existing markets, and conduct important 
research and promotion activities. The Agricultural Marketing Service 
(AMS) provides oversight, paid for by industry assessments, which helps 
ensure fiscal accountability and program integrity. Standing up new 
check offs and considering the impact of legislative changes that would 
could these programs are funded with taxpayer dollars.
    To initiate a national research and promotion program, proponents 
must submit a proposal to USDA. A complete proposal should include: (1) 
industry analysis; (2) justification; (3) objectives; (4) impact on 
small business; (5) evidence of industry support for the program; and 
(6) the text of the proposed order. If determined to be a complete 
proposal, AMS publishes a proposed rule in the Federal Register. In 
addition, the establishment of a new research and promotion program 
requires a referendum.
    AMS oversees 22 research and promotion boards that empower farmers, 
ranchers, and agricultural businesses. The board members, which are 
appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture, and boards' staff direct and 
carry out programs and day-to-day board management responsibilities. 
Every R&P program's mission is to maintain and expand the markets for 
its commodity. AMS provides oversight and ensures fiscal 
responsibility, program efficiency, and fair treatment of participating 
stakeholders. In order to apply and enforce the legislative and 
regulatory provisions of checkoff acts and orders and promote 
consistency in oversight of all commodity promotion and research 
programs, AMS and the boards follow written and approved guidelines 
(Guidelines for AMS Oversight of Commodity Research and Promotion 
Programs--https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/
RPGUIDELINES
092015.pdf).
    In short, AMS provides oversight and direction to industry-funded 
and managed commodity research and promotion programs that broaden and 
enhance national and international markets for various commodities.

    Question 19. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 extended the 
registration review deadline for over 700 pesticides registered under 
FIFRA and directed EPA to take into account feedback from USDA when 
developing mitigation measures for these crop protection tools. This 
language was included as a direct result of growing concerns that EPA 
was ignoring feedback from USDA scientists. Secretary Vilsack, can you 
talk about how the consultation process between the EPA Office of 
Pesticide Programs and the USDA Office of Pest Management Policy has 
improved since the passage of this provision?
    Answer. OPMP continues to engage with EPA in a variety of ways. 
OPMP participated along with EPA, the DOI, and Commerce in the first, 
in-person public meeting of the FIFRA-Endangered Species Act 
Interagency Working Group. OPMP also helped to coordinate the 
Memorandum of Understanding between FPAC and EPA's Office of Chemical 
Safety and Pollution Prevention. In addition, OPMP continues to provide 
suggestions for more workable mitigation options and other potential 
areas of refinement for EPA's assessments, we continue to participate 
in workshops, and we are co-leading with EPA a workshop to help 
identify additional mitigation options and supporting data/information.

    Question 20. Under the Herbicide Strategy recently proposed by the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), farmers across the country would 
need to implement costly mitigation measures as a requirement to use 
herbicides. In comments on this proposal, the USDA estimated it could 
cost as much as $5.5 billion for corn growers in Iowa, Illinois, and 
Nebraska. Given that this cost estimate is for just one commodity grown 
in just three states, the nationwide cost of implementation is bound to 
be much higher. I understand that USDA has been actively engaging with 
EPA on this strategy. Secretary Vilsack, can you detail the 
interactions between USDA and the EPA on this strategy, specifically as 
it relates to the cost of implementation?
    Answer. Through OPMP, USDA has raised with EPA its concerns around 
the potential costs of EPA's efforts to agriculture. We have documented 
our concerns on the impact via public comments on EPA's proposal as 
well as in-person conversations and discussions. USDA has also provided 
alternative proposals that may lessen the impacts on our grower 
stakeholders.

    Question 21. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently 
proposed the Vulnerable Species Pilot Project which takes a draconian 
approach to pesticide restrictions, prohibiting producers from using 
pesticides in the ranges of the 27 selected species unless a producer 
implements at least four mitigations measures from a short list. Many 
of these selected mitigations are not appropriate for producers and 
have a high cost of implementation. In comments on this proposal, USDA 
predicted these areas could affect more than 3.1% of all cropped, 
forested, and pastured areas in the United States. Further, EPA has 
committed to expanding this pilot beyond the 27 selected species. 
Secretary Vilsack, can you detail how USDA has engaged with the EPA on 
the Vulnerable Species Pilot Project?
    Answer. USDA has engaged with EPA on the Vulnerable Species Pilot 
Project (VSPP) by providing detailed public comments on the proposal 
and encouraging EPA to address the issues above. We know that, since 
the release of the VSPP, EPA has provided an update to the VSPP that 
addresses many, but not all, of the concerns raised (or describes how 
they will be addressed). We believe that EPA's active efforts to refine 
any Pesticide Use Limitation Areas will reduce some impact on growers.

    Question 22. Secretary Vilsack, as you know, USDA leads many of the 
Federal efforts managing invasive species and wildfire risks. The use 
of pesticides are important tools in these efforts to control invasive 
pests and weeds that threaten our forests, prairies, wetlands and the 
native species and rural communities that reside there. Has USDA 
considered what impacts recent EPA proposals--such as the Herbicide 
Strategy and Vulnerable Species Pilot Project--would have on the 
Department's ability to use pesticides for these vital land management 
efforts?
    Answer. USDA has considered the potential impacts of EPA's ESA-
related proposals to pesticide users; all users will be impacted to 
varying degrees. Estimating impacts on USDA's land management efforts 
is impossible at this time with the level of information we have on 
EPA's proposals, i.e., we don't know the mitigation expectations for 
the use of any individual pesticide, and we wouldn't have that 
information until chemical-specific draft decisions are released. We 
will work actively with EPA during the re-evaluation of individual 
chemicals and during the implementation phase to help minimize impacts 
on USDA land management efforts.

    Question 23. The 2018 Farm Bill authorized the Agriculture Advanced 
Research and Development Authority (AGARDA) pilot program to develop 
technologies and research tools for long-term agricultural research. 
Since then, AGARDA has received $1 million in both FY 2022 and FY 2023 
to get the pilot started; however, the program has still not been 
implemented and the strategic plan was just released last year. 
Secretary Vilsack, can you provide a status update on AGARDA and 
explain where the money appropriated has gone?
    Answer. The limited initial discretionary annual appropriations 
provided for AGARDA has been used to support staff to develop the 
AGARDA Strategic Framework and host listening sessions to engage with 
partners and stakeholders. Funding constraints prevented us from 
dedicating a specific FTE to this initiative. About $2 million from FY 
2022 and 2023 appropriations have been obligated to support a high-
risk, high-reward, pilot projects. However, until AGARDA is properly 
resourced, this program cannot be implemented to make these the further 
advancements and innovation in agriculture that were envisioned when 
this was included in the 2018 Farm Bill. American investment in public 
agriculture research and development has fallen behind, a decision 
that, left uncorrected, will impact the clothes we wear, food we eat, 
air we breathe, and the innovations we can achieve.

    Question 24. According to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service (APHIS), only 20% of the Regulatory Status Review (RSR) 
timelines in FY 2023 were completed within the regulatory timeframe set 
forth by the SECURE Rule amendments to 7 CFR Part 340. Secretary 
Vilsack, what steps are the Department taking to ensure that RSR 
evaluations are completed within the specified timeframe moving 
forward? Will you commit to devoting the time and resources necessary 
to hasten these reviews?
    Answer. APHIS is working hard to bring the completion of Regulatory 
Status Reviews into greater alignment with the target timeframes in 7 
CFR 340. In FY 2024, APHIS made several improvements, including:

  <bullet> Establishing a review team to identify and implement time-
        saving process improvements.

  <bullet> Prioritizing recruitment and staff development for the work 
        unit performing the evaluations.

  <bullet> Completing the first phase of an information management 
        system that enables more efficient tracking of key steps for 
        pending Regulatory Status Review requests.

    With these efforts, in the first half of FY 2024, APHIS completed 
30 Regulatory Status Reviews (twice the number in completed in FY 
2023), with over 60 percent of these reviews meeting the target 
timeframes under 7 CFR 340.

    Question 25. The recent Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and 
Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence indicates that catalyzing AI 
research across the United States as a priority for the Federal 
Government. Prior to this Executive Order, the USDA National Institute 
of Food and Agriculture was already establishing itself as a leader in 
this space by partnering with the National Science Foundation to launch 
five agricultural-focused AI Institutes across the country. Secretary 
Vilsack, what is the Department's plan for these AI Institutes moving 
forward? What additional steps will USDA take to ensure that the United 
States remains a leader in agricultural focused AI research?
    Answer. Moving forward, the AI institutes will prioritize engaging 
stakeholders and addressing the social acceptance of AI technologies in 
agriculture. This includes fostering open dialogues, addressing ethical 
concerns around data privacy and fairness. The institutes will 
encourage cross-disciplinary research collaborations to tackle complex 
agricultural challenges holistically. They will identify and work on a 
wide range of research topics--from foundational AI to specific 
applications and sustainable practices. Efforts will be made to build 
new multidisciplinary communities and develop the workforce needed for 
an AI-powered revolution in agriculture through educational programs 
and training initiatives. NIFA will continue to strengthen partnerships 
and collaboration with the Agricultural Research Service (ARS). This 
joint effort aims to address research gaps, leverage expertise, and 
align efforts towards sustainability and food security. By implementing 
these strategies focusing on stakeholder engagement, multidisciplinary 
research, workforce development, and strategic partnerships, the AI 
institutes intend to position the United States as a leader in 
responsible AI adoption for transforming agriculture and food systems.
    We remain committed to advancing this crucial endeavor. USDA will 
continue making investments in AI institutes, which is vital to 
position the United States as a global leader in foundation AI research 
tailored for transforming agriculture and food systems while 
prioritizing equitable practices.

    Question 26. Our system of farm conservation has been extremely 
successful because it is producer-first, voluntary, incentive-based 
and, importantly, locally-led. Mr. Secretary, I continue to hear 
concerns from producers and stakeholders because IRA conservation 
funding is limited to so-called climate-smart practices. By restricting 
IRA conservation funding just to activities deemed climate-smart by the 
Department, a significant number of existing practices--some 30-70% 
depending on the state--cannot receive funding despite the proven 
natural resource benefits. How are you working to ensure the locally-
led component of farm bill conservation programs is not lost?
    Can you commit to doing more to protect the locally-led, voluntary, 
and incentive-based nature of farm bill conservation programs?
    Answer. The locally-led process does and will continue to drive 
NRCS's work. The IRA provides significant funding to NRCS for its 
conservation efforts, and the statute directs NRCS to use IRA funds for 
or to prioritize climate mitigation purposes. While IRA focuses on 
climate mitigation efforts, many climate mitigation practices have 
significant co-benefits, and the locally-led process, starting with 
local workgroups and the State Technical Committees, assists State 
Conservationists with prioritizing local resource concerns for general 
farm bill funding that includes the wide array of soil, water, air, 
plants, and animals resource concerns. States have the flexibility to 
utilize numerous fund pools and establish local priorities through the 
locally-led process. Whenever possible, the agency has identified 
opportunities to maximize the impact of this funding, within its 
authority, in providing multiple conservation benefits while directly 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing carbon storage 
associated with agricultural production. I should add that these 
climate practices in IRA are our most popular with producers and the 
data backs that up. Just look at the tremendous demand for these 
practices in FY 2023, when the IRA made $850 million available for 
climate-focused conservation, and the applications NRCS received 
totaled a staggering $2.8 billion.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/09/19/usda-sees-
record-interest-conservation-and-clean-energy-programs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    These are voluntary, farmer friendly, and locally-led projects and 
practices and USDA is fully committed to helping producers with this 
work that in the long run can improve their soil, prevent erosion, earn 
farmers more money, potentially create new revenue streams, and 
increase their productivity.

    Question 27. Mr. Secretary, a letter was recently sent to you by 
several Senators and Representatives requesting that waste storage 
facilities, biogas capture facilities, livestock feed management and 
waste separation facilities not be eligible for IRA conservation 
funding. What is USDA's position on this request?
    Answer. On February 27, 2024, the USDA responded to the referenced 
letter stating that we evaluate all practices designated as climate-
smart mitigation activities using a rigorous science-based, systematic 
process including compelling scientific literature, critical review of 
the best available evidence, and expert knowledge and experience.
    According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Inventory 
of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks, in 2022 U.S. livestock farms 
emitted approximately 46 percent of the U.S. agriculture sector's 
greenhouse gas emissions. USDA support for improved livestock manure 
and feed management technologies not only benefits farmers but also 
provides public benefit by reducing emissions. USDA works to ensure 
activities supported by its programs do not result in harmful localized 
impacts. When USDA supports voluntary farmer-implemented conservation, 
safeguards are in place to ensure public safety and environmental 
performance.

    Question 27a. How will IRA funding be made available in the future 
for similar kinds of infrastructure or livestock-related conservation 
practices? Can USDA commit to the Committee that livestock producers 
will be given fair consideration and will receive contracts through IRA 
funding?
    Answer. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is authorized through 
September 2031. We anticipate that IRA and farm bill funding for 
infrastructure or livestock-related conservation practices may continue 
to be sustainable under flagship conservation programs, such as the 
Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). Through EQIP, NRCS 
provides agricultural producers with one-on-one assistance to plan and 
implement conservation improvements on livestock operations. Yes, USDA 
will commit that livestock producers will be given fair consideration 
and receive contracts through IRA funding.

    Question 28. We've heard loud and clear from producers and 
stakeholders that RCPP agreements are extremely difficult to get 
approved due to an overly arduous process. Mr. Secretary, what 
specifically is USDA doing to help improve the administration of RCPP?
    Answer. NRCS has identified ways to streamline and simplify RCPP, 
ease the burden on employees and partners, and help maximize 
flexibility for partners to leverage their investments with NRCS 
resources and capabilities. Through a concerted effort since the start 
of this Administration, USDA has taken steps to address those concerned 
with RCPP using guidance, feedback, and expertise from partners, 
employees, leadership, and stakeholders, NRCS has identified several 
improvements that the agency expects to implement in the months and 
years ahead such as:

  <bullet> Streamlining RCPP agreements and moving to one programmatic 
        agreement to begin implementing the RCPP projects awarded under 
        the Fiscal Year 2024 notice of funding opportunity. This will 
        allow partners to more quickly begin implementation of their 
        RCPP projects.

  <bullet> Entrusting program management and negotiation to the State 
        Conservationists, who lead NRCS programs in each state, further 
        encouraging the locally-led process and ensuring the necessary 
        technical needs and costs were realized before project proposal 
        submission.

  <bullet> Establishing parameters and expectations for easement 
        negotiations, including availability of easement deed templates 
        and established program processes to reduce partnership 
        agreement negotiation and implementation timeframes.

  <bullet> Improving RCPP guidance and training, ensuring RCPP policies 
        and procedures are communicated in a uniform and consistent 
        manner.

  <bullet> Enhancing existing business tools to improve the user 
        experience while beginning development of new business tools 
        that, through integration and automation, will reduce the time 
        required for agreement negotiation, processing obligations, and 
        making payments to partners.

    The RCPP improvements are coming at a critical time, as they will 
strengthen NRCS's ability to implement the Inflation Reduction Act, 
which provided $4.95 billion in additional funding for the program over 
5 years.

    Question 28a. As we move forward with a new farm bill, how can 
Congress help improve the program?
    Answer. We ask that Congress continue to support us while we work 
to make positive changes for the American people. There is already an 
RCPP improvement effort underway that includes updates in this year's 
RCPP funding opportunity, as part of an ongoing effort to streamline 
NRCS conservation programs and efficiently implement the Inflation 
Reduction Act.

    Question 29. Since ``no net loss'' of wetlands was adopted as a 
national goal in 1977, it has seen support from both Democratic and 
Republican Administrations. Has the Biden-Harris Administration 
reaffirmed this long-standing goal or refined the goal to express a 
goal for ``net gain'' in wetlands? What is your Administration doing to 
prioritize and support voluntary restoration of wetlands to mitigate 
wetland losses?
    Answer. NRCS has been supporting the voluntary restoration of 
wetlands since the Wetlands Reserve Program began in 1992. The 
Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP) was enacted as part 
of the 2014 Farm Bill. Wetland Reserve Easements (WRE) through ACEP 
allow private and Tribal landowners to protect, restore, and enhance 
wetlands that have been previously degraded due to agricultural uses. 
Through Fiscal Year 2023, NRCS has closed on 15,322 ACEP-WRE and 
predecessor program easements covering 2,842,078 acres.
    On September 28, 2023, the Biden-Harris Administration Announced a 
historic $3 billion dollars for climate-smart \3\ practices on 
agricultural lands through the Investing in America agenda. NRCS 
identified priorities for ACEP investments under the Inflation 
Reduction Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/09/28/biden-
harris-administration-makes-available-historic-3-billion.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In Fiscal Year 2023, NRCS enrolled 42 Wetland Reserve Easements 
through the Inflation Reduction Act. In fiscal year 2024, NRCS expanded 
the priority areas for ACEP Wetland Reserve Easements, prioritizing:

  <bullet> Eligible land with soils high in organic carbon,

  <bullet> Eligible lands that will be restored to and managed as 
        forests like bottomland hardwood forests,

  <bullet> Eligible lands in existing forest cover that will be managed 
        as forests,

  <bullet> Several geographically specific priorities (i.e., former 
        cranberry bogs, wet meadows, and ephemeral wetlands in 
        grassland ecosystems).

    The Wetland Mitigation Banking Program \4\ ** (WMBP) also supports 
the development of mitigation banks for the restoration, creation, or 
enhancement of wetlands to compensate for unavoidable impacts to 
wetlands at another location. WMBP supports critical wetland 
restoration and protection while also expanding options for producers. 
These projects allow us to collaborate with states, local governments, 
and other qualified partners to restore, create, and enhance wetland 
ecosystems.

    Question 30. The Migratory Bird Resurgence Initiative (MBRI) within 
the Environmental Quality Incentives Program has been a great success 
in the Prairie Pothole Region and the Pacific, Mississippi, and Central 
Flyways by creating habitat for migrating birds on private lands. Do 
you support the continuing and prioritizing of funding for this 
important initiative?
    Answer. NRCS continues to be committed to supporting this important 
initiative. For the second time, in the spring of 2024, NRCS announced 
that it would be accepting applications from agricultural producers for 
enrollment in a special Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) 
sign-up. NRCS is investing at least $12 million to support agricultural 
producers through the EQIP-MBRI, helping to protect and improve natural 
resources and habitat for migratory birds and other avian species in 
the Prairie Pothole Region and targeted areas of the Pacific, 
Mississippi, and Central Flyways.

    Question 31. Mr. Secretary, by statute, the Rural Energy for 
America Program is limited to ``agricultural producers and small 
businesses.'' How has this limitation impacted the ability for 
agricultural producers to participate in the program through a member-
owned cooperative?
    Answer. The existing statute creates challenges for agricultural 
cooperatives (and farmers) wanting to use the REAP program. 
Agricultural cooperatives can only participate in the REAP program if 
they qualify as a small business as defined by SBA.

    Question 31a. Do you, as the Secretary of USDA, have the ability to 
adequately define the term ``small business'' for the purposes of this 
program to address those concerns?
    Answer. USDA continues to evaluate this.

    Question 32. Siting for solar energy is becoming a bigger and 
bigger issue for my district. Solar developers are outbidding farmers 
for good, highly productive farmland. This has a lasting impact on 
local economies that depend on agricultural production. As you know 
farmland not only produces the food, fuel, and fiber this country 
needs, but also provides tremendous conservation benefits like cleaner 
air and water and habitat for wildlife. What is or what can the 
Department do to ensure that we don't lose our most valuable and 
productive farmland to solar developments?
    Answer. While renewable energy is growing rapidly, it remains less 
than one percent of the loss of farmland nationally, while 99 percent 
of farmland loss is driven by suburban expansion. Federally funded 
projects--including wind and solar projects--must be evaluated for 
significant impact on farmland and alternative sites to minimize the 
use of Federal funds on unnecessary conversion of farmland to 
nonagricultural uses must be considered. This is legally required under 
the Farmland Protection Policy Act and guided by the USDA Natural 
Resource Conservation Service as part of the environmental review 
process. In 2022, 32 Federal agencies evaluated projects that combined, 
could potentially reach roughly \1/100\ of 1 percent (0.014 percent) of 
farmland, and approximately \3/1000\ of 1 percent (0.003 percent) of 
prime or unique farmland. That annual scale is comparable to findings 
from the last 15 years.

    Question 33. Mr. Secretary, it has been roughly 2 years since USDA 
announced $3.1 billion for 141 Climate-Smart Partnership projects, and 
it is my understanding that implementation began in late Spring 2023. 
We've heard from many stakeholders that it's been slow getting projects 
off the ground. How much money has gone out the door, and how much of 
that has reached farmers, ranchers, or foresters?
    Answer. As of February 2024, USDA had finalized agreements for over 
130 agreements ranging from $250,000 to $90,000,000 focused on 
expanding climate-smart markets. Many of these projects have already 
started enrolling producers. Based on the ambitious targets USDA has 
set with these projects, in 2023, nearly 2,000 producers were enrolled 
in the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities initiative, 
encompassing nearly 2 million acres. The USDA expects to see these 
numbers continue to grow rapidly, estimating at least 50,000 farms 
reached in the next 5 years, encompassing more than 25 million acres of 
working land engaged in climate-smart production practices like cover 
crops, no-till, nutrient and manure management, as well as pasture and 
forest management.

    Question 33a. Are you on track to reach the stated goal of an 
emissions reduction of 60 million metric tons of CO<INF>2</INF>?
    Answer. Yes, USDA is working with partners on expanding climate-
smart markets through Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities 
projects that we estimate will result in these reductions. In producing 
climate-smart commodities, a broad range of climate-smart practices 
across different types of commodities is being applied, and we're 
learning from projects on how to scale these practices across thousands 
of farms. These include soil health practices, such as no-till, cover 
crops, and intensive grazing that sequester carbon; practices that 
reduce methane emissions, like manure management practices, covering 
lagoons, and alternative wetting and drying on rice; and fertilizer 
management practices, including using enhanced efficiency fertilizers 
to reduce nitrous oxide emissions. These projects plan to also test 
innovative approaches to measure and monitor the climate benefits from 
these practices, and the approaches include testing innovative 
measurement technologies, leveraging satellite data, employing 
blockchain, developing new data collection systems, and scaling 
estimation methods to provide credible greenhouse gas benefits at low 
cost.

    Question 34. Mr. Secretary, the Security Exchange Commission plans 
to release the final rule for its climate disclosure proposal in April 
2024. Since the SEC initially proposed the rule, it has received 
significant backlash, specifically on the question of SEC's authority 
to require companies to disclose scope three emissions. How have you 
worked with the Chairman to relay the detrimental impacts this rule 
would have on the United States agriculture industry?
    Answer. USDA engaged with the Chairman and SEC staff to communicate 
the potential implications and concerns regarding their climate 
disclosure rule. At the time the proposed rule was being considered, 
USDA provided feedback on options under consideration, including 
concerns around the potential burden of Scope 3 reporting requirements. 
On March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted final rules to enhance and 
standardize climate-related disclosures by public companies and in 
public offering. The final rules will provide more consistent, 
comparable, and reliable information about the financial effects of 
climate-related risks on a registrant's operations and how it manages 
those risks. SEC noted that ``while many investors today are using 
Scope 3 information in their investment decision making, based upon 
public feedback, we are not requiring Scope 3 emissions disclosure at 
this time.'' We will continue to follow the developments of greenhouse 
gas emissions and climate-related financial risk regulation and ensure 
that SEC is informed on the implications of potential approaches on the 
suppliers of agricultural and forestry commodities.

    Question 35. On December 19, 2023, the Rural Utilities Service 
issued a correction notice in the Federal Register, amending the Notice 
of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for the Community Connect Program for 
Fiscal Year 2023. This correction extended the application window to 
February 20, 2024, and notably altered the definition of an eligible 
Proposed Funded Service Area, shifting from areas lacking broadband 
service of 25/3 Mbps to those lacking service of 10/1 Mbps, aligning 
with the 2018 Farm Bill requirements.
    We have heard from stakeholders who have expressed concerns that 
this correction has adversely affected entities' eligibility, leading 
to wasted time and resources in their application process. Can you 
provide insights into the events that prompted the corrective notice to 
the March 20th NOFO, and what measures can the Department implement in 
the future to prevent such occurrences, ensuring that rural communities 
do not expend valuable time and resources on ineligible applications 
for USDA programs?
    Answer. Unlike the 2018 Farm Bill broadband program, the agency did 
not realize that the Community Connect program's definition of 
broadband service was fixed at 10/1 Mbps, without the ability to revise 
the minimum level of service. The FCC's definition of broadband service 
was 25/3 Mbps at the time, and the agency mistakenly attempted to align 
the definition with them but did not apply. Once the error was known, 
the agency was quickly required to reverse course. Going forward with 
the program, the flexibility to define broadband would allow USDA to 
adjust the definition of broadband to be consistent with consumer 
demand and the FCC changes in the definition of broadband. Note that 
the FCC changed the definition of broadband service to 100/20 Mbps in 
March 2024 and has adopted a long-term goal of 1 Gbps/500 Mbps, and so 
the Community Connect program is drastically out of step with the rest 
of the Federal Government and the industry.

    Question 36. Mr. Secretary, USDA has consistently increased the 
build-out speeds in the ReConnect Program since its inception. Most 
recently, in Rounds 3 and 4, entities must now deliver symmetrical 100/
100 speeds, up from 25/3 speeds in Rounds 1 and 2. This symmetrical 
speed mandate seems to diverge from the statutory directive that the 
ReConnect Program maintains ``technological neutrality'' and avoids 
favoring any particular technology. Could you provide us with the 
reasoning behind the Department's decision to institute a universal 
symmetrical speed requirement, seemingly favoring fiber optic networks 
while potentially undermining the technological neutrality principle?
    Can you share with us what specific data the department relied upon 
to determine that retail broadband customers require symmetrical 
broadband speeds?
    Answer. The symmetrical 100/100 build-out speed was chosen to 
fulfill the Congressional mandate to ``future proof'' the investment in 
rural broadband infrastructure. Early build-out investments in rural 
broadband infrastructure were based on the definition of broadband at 
that time. This was 10/1. Broadband demand has expanded well beyond 
that definition. It is important that current broadband infrastructure 
investments, the so-called ``once in a lifetime'' opportunity, meet 
current and future consumer needs. Data on consumer broadband 
subscriptions show a dramatic and rapid ship to high-speed broadband.
    In addition, the rapid advancement of precision agriculture 
technology is creating a rapid increase in on-farm need for high-speed 
broadband. The nature of precision agriculture broadband relies on 
upload as well as download speeds. Symmetric high-speed broadband is a 
vital tool enabling the agriculture sector to fully utilize the 
benefits of precision agriculture.
    Finally, 100/100 symmetric broadband is an important component 
supporting emergency communications in rural areas.
    The build-out speed requirement is based on current and future 
customer needs, including precision agriculture and emergency 
communications. This is a technology-neutral approach. Any type of 
technology that meets this standard can be supported. Significant 
advances in fixed wireless technology put the 100/100 symmetric 
standard within its reach.
    The 100/100 symmetric standard is consistent with the FCC proposed 
``long-term speed goal of 1 Gbps/500 Mbps to give stakeholders a 
collective goal towards which to strive--a better, faster, more robust 
system of communication for American consumers.'' [https://
docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-400675A1.pdf] 

    Question 37. Mr. Secretary, as you know, there have been concerns 
about staffing challenges within the USDA, particularly in the Rural 
Development Office based in Washington, DC. In previous hearings, you 
mentioned that USDA Rural Development is facing 'difficult strategic 
decisions' regarding budget and staffing. Could you elaborate on these 
challenges and outline your strategy to address them, ensuring that 
Rural Development has the necessary staff to effectively carry out its 
mission?
    Answer. Since 2010, the staffing in Rural Development has been 
declining as the programs have increased exponentially. Based on a 
study done in 2020, the optimal staffing level for RD is 6,800 FTE to 
support the necessary loan, grant-making, and servicing needs across 
RD. Due to budget considerations, we are requesting 4,671 FTE in the 
2025 Budget. Between regular appropriations averaging $48 billion in 
program level in the last 3 years, IRA funding supporting $12.2 billion 
in budget authority, and the $2 billion provided in the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Bill, RD is struggling to deploy this unprecedented 
funding levels with the same amount of people for the last 3 years. 
Additionally, RD struggles to provide the much-needed continued 
servicing and support of the recipients of the RD funding provided 
year-over-year. USDA is also focusing on supporting disadvantaged 
communities that need additional assistance from the Federal 
Government. The 2025 budget is requesting a modest increase to continue 
to support our regular program. For the supplemental programs we 
received, with the authorities provided in the law, we are able to 
provide the administrative support to deploy the supplemental programs, 
however, the continued servicing and support to our customers remains a 
challenge. RD is also evaluating their IT processes and developing a 
full business case analysis in several areas to determine the most 
cost-effective and efficient automation available towards streamlining 
our automation solutions. We will continue communications with Congress 
indicating our progress on delivering the funding provided.

    Question 37a. In your testimony, you mention the Rural Partners 
Network, which was created to provide full-time Federal staffers on-
the-ground in certain rural communities to assist the community in 
applying to Federal programs by providing technical assistance.
    Can you elaborate on the number of Federal staff that you have 
selectively placed in certain rural communities? How has this 
expenditure on staff impacted the department's ability to meet the 
strategic challenges you just outlined?
    Answer. The Rural Partners Network was launched in April 2022 with 
the express purpose to address the needs of distressed rural 
communities that have long been challenged by substantial under-
investment through Federal resources. RPN is a recognition that the 
Federal Government can do more to support these communities. The 
addition of the Federal staff we have hired to support the identified 
communities and the collaboration amongst 25+ Federal agencies has led 
to increased visibility and access to Federal programs. For example, in 
Fulton County, Kentucky, local leadership leveraged RPN to address 
long-standing challenges in the transportation space leading to 
significant investments from the Department of Transportation. It is 
one thing to make opportunities available to rural communities, but if 
we are seeking to assist a small community with a part-time Mayor and a 
town clerk, there is also a need to assist with significant capacity 
challenges. RPN exists to fill and strengthen those capacity gaps.
    Specifically, we have hired 36 staff supporting 36 multi-
jurisdictional networks across the country. That same staff also 
supports additional distressed rural communities in the states in which 
they reside to connect these communities to appropriate resources. 
While they are USDA employees, this staff serves as excellent 
ambassadors to Federal programs beyond just USDA and have directly 
leveraged over $300 million in assistance to RPN communities. Given the 
value proposition, this staff positively impacts USDA's ability to meet 
our strategic challenges, while also supporting our Federal partners' 
efforts to address needs in underserved communities. We have received 
requests from additional communities and would love an opportunity to 
implement RPN in more places, with consideration for smart expansion 
based on budget and needs.

    Question 38. Mr. Secretary, the Rural Innovation Stronger Economy 
(RISE) Grant Program has been quite popular as it helps rural 
communities foster job creation and support new businesses. However, 
there remains a pressing concern among my constituents regarding 
existing workforce challenges. Sectors such as telecommunications, 
water and wastewater services, electric services, health care, and 
other key community services are experiencing a scarcity of prospective 
employees.
    As we work on drafting the upcoming farm bill, what strategies do 
you envision to more effectively address these current workforce 
challenges we see in rural America?
    Answer. The Rural Innovation Stronger Economy (RISE) Grant Program, 
launched in the last farm bill, has experienced high demand since 
inception, however, the challenges to the program have been funding 
levels and oversubscription. The RISE program received a portion of 
authorized funding in Fiscal Years 2021, 2022, and 2023 with no funding 
in FY 2024. There were 16 awards made out of nearly 400 applications in 
those years.
    The RISE program provides funding for collaborative regional 
stakeholder projects addressing current workforce challenges in rural 
areas. In particular, RISE helps secure funding for innovative 
programs, which results in providing a solution to one of the key 
workforce challenges in rural areas, high-paying jobs. Additionally, 
with an aging population in rural areas, shortages of highly skilled 
labor continue to occur. Programs such as RISE help address innovative 
regional planning and implementation to provide high-paying jobs and to 
train rural citizens in skilled employment.

    Question 39. In October 2023, the USDA and the Small Business 
Administration signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) focused on 
aspects such as capital access and support for businesses in rural 
America, reminiscent of a previous MOU from early 2018 that lapsed last 
year. Could you highlight the lessons learned from the 2018 MOU, 
discuss how both agencies aim to enhance their collaborative efforts, 
and provide us with your expectations on the anticipated benefits this 
collaboration will bring to rural America?
    Answer. The 2018 MOU did not take advantage of all the potential 
synergies across the Department of Agriculture, and its focus was 
limited to the Rural Development mission area.
    The 2023 MOU expanded upon the previous MOU by including more 
mission areas and agencies explicitly in the MOU thereby providing more 
opportunities for collaboration across both agencies. There is a table 
of synergies where USDA and SBA can strengthen their partnerships and 
break down silos to provide greater access to capital and opportunities 
in rural America.
    Right now, USDA is making sure small businesses in Rural Partners 
Network (RPN) community networks can take advantage of SBA's HUB Zone 
programs. Our expectations are that through the MOU, USDA and SBA will 
take advantage of the existing synergies. We also expect more 
opportunities for cooperatives to have access to SBA products and tools 
to support rural communities.

    Question 39a. The recently signed MOU in October delineates 
potential synergies between the USDA and the Small Business 
Administration in the realm of lending. While collaboration is crucial, 
I want to emphasize the significance of USDA's lending programs, 
specifically tailored to our farmers. Can you assure that these 
programs will not be compromised by the involvement of another agency, 
and commit to ensuring their continued effectiveness?
    Answer. The focus of the MOU is providing access to capital to 
rural small businesses that are uniquely at a disadvantage. The MOU 
will also help cooperatives access SBA products since their business 
structure limits the eligibility for SBA programs. The MOU serves to 
complement USDA programs rather than as a substitute for USDA programs 
that lend to our farmers.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Austin Scott, a Representative in Congress 
        from Georgia
    Question 1. Mr. Secretary, as you know, Section 1005 of the 
American Rescue Plan was intended to provide loan forgiveness to 
``socially disadvantaged'' borrowers, based solely on race and 
ethnicity and irrespective of any other factors. In response to the 
filing of Holman v. Vilsack, a court opinion dated July 8, 2021 
declared a nationwide injunction on all debt forgiveness in which the 
judge concluded that USDA was unable to prove that the loan forgiveness 
failed to meet the necessary tests, that the ``Plaintiff has shown a 
substantial likelihood that he will prevail on his claim that Section 
1005 violates his right to equal protection under the law'' and that 
``the remedy chosen and provided in Section 1005 appears to fall well 
short of the delicate balance accomplished when a legislative enactment 
employs race in a narrowly tailored manner to address a specific 
compelling governmental interest.''. Ultimately, Section 1005 was 
repealed via the Inflation Reduction Act and the case is moot, yet the 
legal rationale for the injunction remains valid. One would think your 
Department would consider this court ruling in the development of 
future efforts that provide relief based on racial and ethnic factors, 
yet it seems that your Department is doubling down.
    Answer. USDA makes all efforts to ensure that its actions are 
consistent with the law.

    Question 2. In the Extending Government Funding and Delivering 
Emergency Assistance Act (P.L. 117-43) Congress provided funding to 
cover losses due to a litany of disasters occurring in 2020 and 2021. 
In order to ensure equity amongst producers who paid substantial 
premiums for insurance and risk management coverage vs. those that did 
not, Congress instructed USDA that any calculation utilizing crop 
insurance indemnities should utilize net indemnities (i.e., ``minus any 
premiums or fees paid for such coverage'') rather than gross 
indemnities. This essentially resulted in a premium rebate that was 
provided to all producers. Yet in the assistance for 2022 losses 
provided by the Disaster Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2023 
(P.L. 117-328), USDA decided to arbitrarily exclude white males from 
receiving this premium rebate despite no material changes in the 
statutory text. Mr. Secretary, in the absence of direction from 
Congress and in light of the court's opinion in Holman v. Vilsack, 
please explain your rationale for this clearly discriminatory 
administrative decision. Mr. Secretary, I continue to hear from family 
farmers in my district about the failure of the 2022 Emergency Relief 
Program for Production Agriculture. Farmers were already anticipating a 
lower level of disaster assistance for their losses due to lack of 
funding, only to learn that USDA in D.C. had implemented a new 
methodology for ERP that would only pay a fraction of what was already 
a partial payment on losses. If Congress approves disaster assistance 
funding for crop year 2023, do you anticipate USDA using the same ERP 
structure as in 2022?
    Answer. USDA can deliver more assistance to disaster-affected 
producers when available funding more closely aligns with uncovered 
losses. If Congress authorizes additional disaster assistance funding 
for crop year 2023, USDA will carefully consider that statutory 
authority and the funding provided in designing disaster assistance.
    As I have shared with many others on this Committee, for disasters 
occurring during the calendar years 2020 and 2021, Congress authorized 
$10 billion in emergency relief funding to assist agricultural 
producers impacted by wildfires, droughts, hurricanes, winter storms, 
and other eligible disasters. Yet, in early conversations about the 
need for 2022 emergency relief assistance, USDA informed Congress that 
the estimated disaster-impacted producers incurred at least $10 billion 
in uncovered losses. Actual numbers are closer to $12 billion in 
uncovered losses.
    Given that available funding for crop losses (approximately $3.2 
billion) was substantially less than the estimated costs to adequately 
cover 2022 disaster losses, USDA designed a program within those 
funding constraints and within the statutory authority.
    USDA used its discretion to design a program to deliver more 
benefits to the majority of producers. The end result was a more 
advantageous, equitable distribution of the limited funds to more 
producers in need of assistance. Specifically in your home state of 
Georgia, the ERP 2022 progressive factoring option resulted in more 
advantageous than the flat factor for 75% of Georgia program 
participants, approximately 3,212 producers.

    Question 3. I saw the USDA press release yesterday where you 
announced yet another new conservation program hiring additional staff 
for USDA. Small, medium, and large size growers, as well as lenders, 
community banks, and farm credit, are telling me and my staff that the 
current 2018 Farm Bill programs are not functioning effectively with 
the increased input costs of production farmers have experienced. Your 
own staff has issued reports, both before the Holidays and recently, 
that demonstrate a continued slide in net farm income and an 
agricultural trade deficit. We are going to lose a generation of 
farmers unless we shift from climate initiatives to a focus on 
production agriculture. You have the resources to work with the 
Committees on how to increase reference prices, and where to find 
funding, for farmers that are producing our food and fiber. Will you 
ask your staff to spend more time on how to address the financial 
situation of production agriculture versus how to expand climate 
initiatives?
    Answer. Thank you for your question, I expect the press release you 
recently saw was related to the February 12, 2024 announcement that 
USDA was hiring staff to help with the record numbers of applications 
from farmers, ranchers, and rural small businesses that are seeking 
USDA funding for clean energy projects under the Rural Energy for 
America Program \5\ (REAP). Those new positions were funded by the IRA 
and are necessary to ensure that our nation's small-, medium-, and 
large-size producers, rural businesses, and communities are able access 
the historic IRA funding to make clean energy improvements at their 
farms, ranches, and businesses that will help them to lower energy 
costs, bring in new streams of income, and also address climate change. 
It is a false dilemma to think that acting on climate change and 
supporting those IRA programs is not also helping farmers financial 
bottom lines.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    With respect to farm income USDA has taken unprecedented actions to 
level the playing field so that our small and mid-sized farmers can get 
a fair price for their products, while making billions of dollars in 
transformative investments through the ARP and IRA to create new 
markets and new income opportunities for family farmers so it is not 
simply the old proposition of get big or get out. USDA will continue to 
focus its efforts on helping these producers by enhancing economic 
resiliency and robust price competition, increasing our farmers' and 
ranchers' earnings, increasing the ability to compete, and keeping 
farming viable and rural communities thriving.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Doug LaMalfa, a Representative in Congress 
        from California
    Question 1. Mr. Secretary, domestic competitiveness is very 
important for all producers. In your trade agenda, with Under Secretary 
Taylor, you've stated trade should benefit everyone, but specialty 
crops especially are facing import pressures and problems with domestic 
competitiveness. Besides RAPP, what can the USDA do to enhance domestic 
product competitiveness against imports?
    Answer. On November 9, 2023, USDA announced the Specialty Crops 
Competitiveness Initiative (SCCI) as part of a larger effort to support 
specialty crop producers. The objective of SCCI is to better focus USDA 
resources and identify needs to support the competitiveness of U.S. 
specialty crops in domestic and international markets, minimize costs, 
manage pests and diseases, strengthen supply chains, and support 
climate outcomes. Senior USDA officials have held roundtable meetings 
to meet directly with specialty crop stakeholders in Arizona, 
California Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and 
Washington State. Currently, USDA is reviewing comments on the Request 
for Information, published in the Federal Register that closed on March 
8, 2024.
    Utilizing a portion of Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) funding, 
the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) developed a $100 million 
initiative designed to address the unique export challenges of the 
specialty crop sector and provide support to overcome them. The effort, 
known as the Assisting Specialty Crop Exports Assisting Specialty Crop 
Exports (ASCE) initiative, will complement, but not replicate, support 
already provided through the Market Access Program (MAP) and the 
Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops (TASC) program. This 
initiative is an opportunity for FAS to partner with the specialty crop 
industry beyond the provision of grants, by leveraging the depth and 
breadth of USDA's expertise to address foreign trade barriers. We will 
match that expertise with specific industry-identified bottlenecks. 
USDA will design projects based on industry feedback. Funds will be 
directed to organizations that can deliver the education, the data 
collection, or the research needed to address the export barriers 
identified.

    Question 2. Mr. Secretary, the Emergency Relief Program had 
different implementation approaches from 2021-2022, putting California 
producers at a disadvantage. Changing process is difficult for 
producers and the payments are so low many producers found the process 
not worth it. How can the USDA create more certainty for producers 
impacted by disasters?
    Answer. For disasters occurring during the calendar years 2020 and 
2021, Congress authorized $10 billion in emergency relief funding to 
assist agricultural producers impacted by wildfires, droughts, 
hurricanes, winter storms, and other eligible disasters.
    In early conversations about the need for 2022 emergency relief 
assistance, USDA informed Congress that the Department estimated 
disaster-impacted producers incurred at least $10 billion in uncovered 
losses. Actual numbers are closer to $12 billion in uncovered losses.
    Given that available funding for crop losses (approximately $3.2 
billion) was substantially less than the estimated costs to adequately 
cover the disaster losses for 2022, USDA designed a program within 
those funding constraints.
    USDA can deliver additional assistance to disaster-affected 
producers when available funding more closely aligns with uncovered 
losses. Permanent disaster authority and funding would provide 
certainty for producers that additional resources are available to 
reduce the impact of uncovered losses when unexpected disasters occur.

    Question 3. Mr. Secretary, the current labor shortage continues to 
be a big issue for farmers across the country and in my district, 
especially for the specialty crop industry. Although your agency does 
not have direct jurisdiction on the H-2A temporary worker program, the 
USDA can further the advancement of mechanization and automation 
research and development.
    Answer. See response to LaMalfa Question 3a.

    Question 3a. What conversations have your Administration had on the 
topic and is anything being done to further mechanization research and 
development?
    Answer. Title VII, Section 7610 of the Agriculture Improvement Act 
of 2018 includes a request to identify programs of the USDA that 
accelerate the development and use of automation or mechanization in 
the production or processing of specialty crops. USDA has six such 
programs in the Agricultural Marketing Service, the Agricultural 
Research Service, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture. 
The USDA Economic Research Service submitted a report to Congress in 
2020 describing these programs (https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/
pub-details/?pubid=958
27).
    USDA has leveraged several opportunities provided by Congress to 
accelerate the development and use of automation or mechanization in 
the production or processing of specialty crops. The Agricultural 
Marketing Service (AMS) provides a variety of services to establish the 
quality and availability of agricultural products for U.S. consumers 
and market opportunities domestically and internationally for U.S. 
agricultural producers. Support for rural America and the Nation's 
agricultural sector is provided, in part, through a variety of AMS-
managed competitive and non-competitive grant programs, including the 
Specialty Crop Block Grant Program (SCBGP). The SCBGP is a non-
competitive grant program, which provides funds (approximately $72.3 M 
in FY 2024) to state departments of agriculture to enhance the 
competitiveness of specialty crops. Promoting new research and 
development is one of seven key outcomes and performance measures under 
the SCBGP, which USDA actively monitors and evaluates as part of an 
annual performance report. Legislative authority is provided under 
section 101 of the Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act of 2004 (7 
U.S.C.  1621 note) and amended under section 10107 of the Agriculture 
Improvement Act of 2018, Public Law 115-343 (the farm bill).
    Under the SCBGP, State Departments of Agriculture have utilized 
funding to administer a wide range of projects promoting mechanization 
and automation efforts, including unmanned aerial systems/drone 
technology, precision agriculture, and artificial intelligence.

    Question 3b. Has your agency identified any ways in which your sub 
departments can implement these strategies?
    Answer. See response to LaMalfa Question 3a.

    Question 4. Mr. Secretary: Recently, the EPA finalized a proposal 
that will lower the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for 
Particulate Matter 2.5. Additionally, USDA just concluded a comment 
period for a proposal that would implement a land management plan 
change to all national forests specifically for old growth. States in 
the West like California have tremendous fuels treatment needs and this 
new standard could significantly limit the number of windows available 
for land managers to conduct essential prescribed burns to prevent 
future catastrophic wildfires.
    Given the catastrophic impact of wildfire in the West, can you 
discuss what kind of impact EPA's new rule as well as a new-found focus 
on old growth will have on other Forest Service priorities such as the 
10 year strategy for confronting the wildfire crisis?
    Answer. We believe the proposed amendment will provide more 
certainty, which will facilitate, rather than hinder, implementation of 
the Wildfire Crisis Strategy and other priorities.

    Question 4a. Regarding the PM<INF>2.5</INF> ru[l]ing, have the 
agencies discussed how to address prescribed fire on private lands?
    Answer. The EPA strengthened the primary (health-based) annual fine 
particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality 
Standard (NAAQS) from 12 micrograms per cubic meter to 9 micrograms per 
cubic meter. The stronger standard may affect burners of wildlands 
regardless of land ownership whether Federal, state, Tribal, local, or 
private land. Since the EPA released the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
(NPRM) in early 2023, the USDA, Forest Service, EPA, DOI, and CDC have 
been discussing potential implications of the revised NAAQS at 
leadership to staff levels. On November 9th of 2023, EPA Administrator 
Michael S. Regan, DOI Secretary Deb Haaland, USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack 
and Director of CDC Mandy Cohen announced a Memorandum of Understanding 
\6\ (MOU) to further their joint work to protect communities from the 
impacts of wildfire smoke, while promoting land management practices 
that reduce the risk of large, severe wildfires which includes 
strategic use of prescribed fire (Biden-Harris Administration Agencies 
Sign Interagency Agreement to Address Wildfire Risk and Protect 
Communities from Smoke D The White House \6\).

2023/11/09/biden-harris-administration-agencies-sign-interagency-
agreement-to-address-wildfire-risk-and-protect-communities-from-smoke/
.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Forest Service, EPA, DOI, and CDC released a joint workplan 
outlining wildland fire-related priorities the agencies will focus on 
for fiscal years 2024-2025. This workplan, which had activity starting 
in 2023, specifically builds on concerns about the implementation of 
the new standard for all landowners that use prescribed fire on 
wildlands. One of the joint exercises, a multi-day tabletop effort held 
in Georgia in January 2024, highlighted the specific challenges for 
private landowners who use prescribed fire and how Federal, state, and 
local forestry, air quality, and public health agencies will need to 
work together to ensure continued use of prescribed fire under the 
revised PM<INF>2.5</INF> standard. As the standard is now effective, 
the EPA, USDA, Forest Service, DOI, and CDC are continuing the work to 
evaluate implementation of the standard, efficient application of 
pertinent existing Clean Air Act regulations that affect prescribed 
fire use and to work together to build tools to support an alignment of 
land management and air quality objectives.

    Question 4b. What measures are in place to ensure we can use 
prescribed fire regardless of jurisdiction?
    Answer. As part of the aforementioned MOU and workplan, the 
application of the EPA's Exceptional Events Rule \7\ (EER) (Treatment 
of Air Quality Monitoring Data Influenced by Exceptional Events D U.S. 
EPA \7\) will be an important tool for maintaining wildland prescribed 
fire use for all jurisdictions under the revised annual 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> standard. After meeting provisions of the Rule, the 
EPA allows for exclusion of data influenced by prescribed fires on 
wildland in the context of an action of regulatory significance. Such 
actions include initial area designations, which is currently ongoing 
following the final NAAQS revision. Thus, states may seek exclusion 
through the EER for data influenced by prescribed fires on wildland, 
consistent with the EER, for purposes of the initial area designations 
process. The EPA and other signatories to the MOU have developed 
several tools and approaches to make the EER process as efficient as 
possible to aid in this monitoring data being subsequently excluded for 
purposes of initial area designations. The MOU has facilitated 
productive conversations with EPA and we are exploring frameworks that 
will allow state, local, and Tribal air managers to avoid the burden of 
unneeded analysis, have needed data readily available, and other 
efficiencies that meet the needs of air managers while avoiding 
creating a disincentive for the use of prescribed fire on wildlands 
regardless of jurisdiction.

    Question 5. Mr. Secretary: The Fish and Wildlife Service recently 
proposed an updated policy and new rule for management of the National 
Wildlife Refuge System focused on Biological Integrity, Diversity, and 
Environmental Health (BIDEH). In the section of the proposal entitled 
``Management activities and uses with potential to ensure biological 
integrity, diversity, and environmental health,'' FWS proposes to ban 
native predator control, the use of genetically engineered organisms, 
and agricultural uses, except where required by statute or other 
limited reasons. Farmers and ranchers are an important part of the 
refuge system, and indeed the FWS website says ``Cooperative 
agriculture--partnering with farmers and ranchers to meet wildlife 
management objectives--is a long-standing practice on national wildlife 
refuges.'' You have testified before this Committee and given speeches 
expressing concern about farms getting pushed out of business in recent 
years.
    Was USDA consulted about these proposals in its capacity as part of 
the Federal Government's coordinated, risk-based system to ensure that 
new biotechnology products are safe for the environment and human and 
animal health?
    Answer. USDA's APHIS was not consulted as part of the Coordinated 
Framework. USDA welcomes the opportunity to collaborate with the 
Service as it determines next steps and as contemplated in the U.S. 
Coordinated Framework for the Regulation of Biotechnology, which 
describes how Federal agencies will work together to ensure the safety 
of biotechnology products.

    Question 5a. Was USDA consulted about the impact that removing 
agriculture from the Refuge System could have on family farms and rural 
communities?
    Answer. USDA's APHIS was not consulted on this rule.

    Question 6. Mr. Secretary, I continue to be concerned about Buy 
American requirements in school meals. American dollars should support 
American-produced food products. U.S. farmers produce some of the 
safest and most nutritious food worldwide for our families and children 
while creating American jobs. I have a bill to tighten some of these 
requirements and sent a letter with my colleagues about the 
requirements in your proposed school meals rule.
    Can you commit that any final rule on school meals will tighten Buy 
American requirements and close the current loopholes that allow 
overseas fruits and vegetables that could be bought from farmers in my 
district?
    Answer. The Biden-Harris Administration shares your commitment to 
prioritizing American products in the school meal programs. Under the 
National School Lunch Act, all schools participating in Federal school 
meal programs are required to purchase domestic commodities and 
products ``to the maximum extent practicable.'' Implementing guidance 
provides two exceptions under which schools may purchase non-domestic 
foods:

  (1)  When a product is not produced or manufactured in the U.S. in 
            sufficient and reasonably available quantities of a 
            satisfactory quality; or,

  (2)  When the cost of the U.S. product is significantly higher than 
            the foreign product.

    Recently proposed regulations entitled ``Child Nutrition Programs: 
Revisions to Meal Patterns Consistent with the 2020 Dietary Guidelines 
for Americans \8\'' would strengthen Buy American requirements for 
school meals and would make it easier for schools to buy locally grown 
foods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\ https://www.fns.usda.gov/cn/fr-020723.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In order to further strengthen the Buy American provision, USDA 
proposed to institute a five percent ceiling on the non-domestic 
commercial foods a school food authority may purchase per school year. 
By proposing to institute a five percent cap, USDA is balancing the 
intent of the Buy American provision to support American farmers and 
ranchers while also recognizing that there are times when purchasing 
domestic foods is not practicable for schools.
    Furthermore, the proposed regulations would make it clear that 
schools can use a geographic preference to procure local food for 
school meals.
    USDA Foods in Schools purchases about 2 billion pounds of food from 
American farmers each year, which makes up about 15 to 20 percent of 
the food served in the National School Lunch Program. All USDA Foods 
must be domestically produced.
    Additionally, the USDA Department of Defense Fresh Fruit and 
Vegetable Program (USDA DoD Fresh) helps schools to use USDA Foods 
entitlement dollars to buy fresh domestic produce, offering schools a 
variety of U.S.-grown whole and pre-cut fresh fruits and vegetables. In 
Fiscal Year 2023, more than 42,000 schools placed orders for weekly 
deliveries of American-grown fresh fruits and vegetables through USDA 
DoD Fresh spending over $552 million in support for domestic fruits and 
vegetables.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Trent Kelly, a Representative in Congress 
        from Mississippi
    Question 1. The states of the Lower Mississippi Valley, especially 
my home state, experienced historic conversion of wetlands to produce 
the food and fiber necessary to feed and clothe our nation. The broad 
suite of USDA conservation programs, especially the Wetlands Reserve 
Easements, are popular with our producers and benefit society broadly. 
What is your Administration doing to ensure significant funding 
continues to flow to this region for producers to voluntarily restore 
wetlands?
    Answer. NRCS is updating its processes around easement acquisition 
activities including appraisals and land surveys to enroll land into 
easements. NRCS plans to encourage procurement of land surveys earlier 
in the acquisition timeline, such as when an application has been 
tentatively selected for an ACEP-WRE enrollment. NRCS is also 
increasing its use of partnerships to assist with acquiring the land 
surveys and has simplified the review process for producer-acquired 
land surveys. This will speed up the time it takes producers and 
landowners to enroll.
    These improvements are the first step in an ongoing effort to 
streamline ACEP and ensure that significant funding can flow to the 
region through easier and convenient utilization of the program. The 
improvements will also strengthen implementation of the Inflation 
Reduction Act, which included 1.4 billion in additional funding for 
ACEP over 5 years.
    NRCS annually announces additional funding opportunities through 
the Wetland Reserve Enhancement Partnership (WREP). The purpose of WREP 
enrollment is to target and leverage resources to address high-priority 
wetland protection, restoration, and enhancement objectives through 
agreements with states.

    Question 2. Inflation Reduction Act funding was intended to support 
climate-smart conservation practices and help level the playing field 
for historically underserved producers to adopt these practices. My 
state, along with the other Southern states, has the greatest 
proportion of producers in the U.S. How much of the IRA funding and in 
what proportion has been provided for climate-smart practices and 
historically underserved producers in our region?
    Answer. NRCS has continued to reach out and interact with the 
historically underserved groups. In addition to this targeted outreach, 
NRCS has been looking at ways to streamline programs and reduce 
barriers to program participation. Below is a table showing the amount 
of IRA funding for CSP and EQIP at a national level and in the 
Southeast Region. The states included in the Southeast region are 
Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and the Caribbean 
Area.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Through the Rural Energy for America Program, in FY 2022 and FY2024 
so far, the Rural Development has obligated over $362 million to 
projects serving historically underserved producers across the country, 
which represents nearly 4% of the program. For the States of North 
Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, 
Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Texas a total 
of over $122 million has been invested in underserved communities.
    Projects by underserved producers score higher and are prioritized 
by our Technical Assistance providers for outreach and support to 
underserved communities.

    Question 3. Thank you for USDA's leadership in promoting voluntary 
and incentive-based climate-smart agriculture programs. Robert Bonnie, 
Under Secretary for Farm Production and Conservation, has made the case 
that technology will be critical to ensuring farmers can reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining global food supplies. Bonnie 
has noted that some climate-smart practices are dependent on the use of 
herbicides. Secretary Vilsack, how is USDA working with EPA to ensure 
that growers have access to safe and effective pesticide tools to 
continue to utilize climate-smart agriculture practices and meet our 
sustainability goals?
    Answer. The USDA is led in pesticide policy by the Office of Pest 
Management and Policy (OPMP) and the Natural Resources Conservation 
Service (NRCS), which actively works with the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) on the registration of new active ingredients and 
pesticide registration review. OPMP and NRCS coordinate Departmental 
activities and services regarding the development, availability, and 
use of economically and environmentally sound pest management tools and 
practices.

  <bullet> USDA provides EPA with the most accurate data available to 
        help ensure that pesticide decisions are based on modern, 
        realistic agricultural practices.

  <bullet> USDA reviews and responds to proposed pesticide risk 
        mitigation strategies.

  <bullet> USDA conducts surveys and analyzes available data to answer 
        pest management-related research questions.

  <bullet> USDA communicates with stakeholder groups regarding pest 
        management-related decisions and policies.

    On February 6, 2024, the USDA signed a memorandum of understanding 
(MOU) with the EPA. This MOU describes how EPA can reference NRCS 
conservation practices so that growers who voluntarily perform those 
practices can meet pesticide label requirements.

    Question 4. Congress directed the EPA to consult with USDA and ESA-
FIFRA Interagency Working Group members to develop measures to reduce 
the effects of pesticides on listed species and their critical 
habitats. Secretary Vilsack, how did EPA reach out to USDA when 
developing the new ESA work plan, work plan update, the Vulnerable 
Species Pilot, and the Herbicide Strategy? EPA has mentioned that they 
are working with NRCS regarding voluntary conservation efforts in their 
ESA mitigation efforts. Secretary Vilsack, can you give the Committee 
some idea of what EPA and NRCS are working on? How do we ensure that 
NRCS programs continue to be voluntary?
    Answer. As part of the IWG, USDA had the opportunity to provide 
comment on the ESA workplan. USDA and EPA staff have regular calls to 
discuss pesticide issues, including the ESA workplan and its 
implementation.
    The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Department 
of Agriculture (USDA) signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to 
better align EPA's strategies for protecting endangered species from 
pesticides with USDA's National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) 
voluntary and incentive-based producer conservation practices. This 
coordination will help EPA meet its obligations under the Endangered 
Species Act (ESA) while increasing flexibility for the agricultural 
community and keeping safe, effective pest management tools in farmers' 
hands. As part of the review process for the MOU, USDA worked to ensure 
that the MOU clearly states that NRCS programs must remain voluntary. 
NRCS and USDA will continue to maintain that position in the 
development of any additional guidance materials on the MOU.

    Question 5. The Office of Pest Management Policy works well with 
EPA. Still, sometimes, their comments are not addressed by the EPA 
during the registration and reevaluation process for pesticides. How 
are you working with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency to ensure that during the interagency process that OPMP data and 
information is included?
    Answer. OPMP is constantly working to ensure that our data and 
information are included in decision-making by providing clear and 
transparent information in such a way as to be most useful and easily 
understood by EPA at all levels. We also provide that information 
through public processes to ensure that that information is in the 
public record should laws or policies change in the future.

    Question 6. Formaldehyde is an essential building block in 
chemistry with various uses that are essential to keeping America's 
meat, poultry, crop protection, and aquaculture products safe. These 
uses are especially important for the Mississippi aquaculture industry, 
which produces 65% of the nation's catfish. Aquaculture operations use 
formaldehyde to control fungi and prevent deadly bacterial infections. 
Pork and poultry producers use formaldehyde products to prevent viruses 
and bacteria, including protecting against a catastrophic outbreak of 
African Swine Fever. The EPA is undertaking a risk evaluation for 
formaldehyde under TSCA and FIFRA. I've heard concerns from agriculture 
stakeholders who worry that unreasonable regulations not based on sound 
science will threaten these vital uses. Secretary Vilsack, has the EPA 
engaged with USDA to discuss the formaldehyde risk evaluation? Given 
the impact of agriculture and food safety, will you commit to ensuring 
USDA is voicing the concerns of the ag community during the interagency 
process?
    Answer. We share your interest in ensuring farmers have access to 
tools that help keep America's meat, poultry, crop protection, and 
aquaculture products safe. When other Departments or Agencies pursue 
significant rulemaking, USDA actively engages in the interagency review 
process established by Executive Order 12866. There are currently no 
EPA rules on formaldehyde in the interagency review process. On March 
15, 2024, EPA released the draft risk evaluation under TSCA for 
formaldehyde for public comment. This is the next step in a process 
that could result in regulations in 2026. EPA also released for public 
comment the draft risk assessment under FIFRA on April 19, 2024. USDA 
provided comments during the FIFRA public comment periods that EPA will 
consider as it revises the assessment and we will be actively engaged 
in the interagency review of any regulations that flow from this risk 
assessment.

    Question 7. Mr. Secretary, Congress approved over $18 billion in 
conservation dollars through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. I 
hear from my constituents back home about a lack of conservation 
funding actually getting to working lands programs and producers on the 
ground. For legislation passed over 2 years ago, can you explain to the 
Committee why the Department is taking so long to get these funds out 
to the countryside and how you intend to get those funds on the ground 
faster and more effectively?
    Answer. Recently, NRCS has experienced unprecedented demand for 
conservation from farmers and ranchers, with applications outpacing 
available funding. Even with Inflation Reduction Act funding, NRCS had 
significant unmet producer demand for conservation through the 
Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and the Agricultural 
Conservation Easement Program (ACEP).
    Please refer to our February 13, 2024, press release,\9\ which 
talks about how NRCS made record investments in private lands 
conservation in fiscal year 2023 thanks to historic resources made 
available by President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, the largest 
investment in climate action in history. I can assure you that we are 
getting these conservation investments to our working lands programs 
and to producers on the ground who are eager to sign up for these 
climate practices. That said as I shared at the hearing, we have seen 
demand for these climate practices and our working lands programs in 
IRA and the farm bill far outstrip the funding Congress provided. We 
will continue to work with farmers, ranchers, and forestland owners on 
the ground to help them both protect natural resources and enhance 
production.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    For Fiscal Year 2023, NRCS has also released data showing its 
investment of over $2.8 billion in financial assistance for 
conservation and supported more than 45,000 contracts, more than any 
year in the agency's 89 year history. The agency obligated 99.8 percent 
of all available FY 2023 Inflation Reduction Act financial assistance 
funds to farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners across America and is 
on track to have robust producer participation in 2024.
    The agency has also released updated state-by-state data\10\ 
showing where investments went in FY 2023 for the farm bill and 
Inflation Reduction Act. Minnesota alone had 175 IRA contacts in FY 
2023 totaling $9.8 million in conservation funding covering over 77 
million acres. There were also additional investments through farm bill 
conservation funding.

    Question 8. Mr. Secretary, Congress appropriated $3 billion of ad 
hoc disaster assistance for crop losses from the 2022 crop. Can you 
explain to the Committee why it's taken the Department almost a year to 
implement the program and why the Department structured the program in 
such a way that producers who suffered significant losses aren't 
getting adequate help due to the payment reduction factors?
    Answer. The rollout timing of ERP 2022 was due to the 
Administration's efforts to incorporate key enhancements from lessons 
learned through the administration of ERP Phases 1 and 2. Specific 
enhancements include but are not limited to, implementation of a multi-
track process to provide all disaster-affected participants with access 
to relief simultaneously in lieu of phased delivery, inclusion of 
additional substantial beneficial interest (SBI) holders on prefilled 
applications, and development of an automated process supporting 
updates to prefilled applications as new or updated crop insurance and 
Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) records are 
available. Enrollment began October 31, 2023. An ending date has not 
been announced.
    For disasters occurring during the calendar years 2020 and 2021, 
Congress authorized $10 billion in emergency relief funding to assist 
agricultural producers impacted by wildfires, droughts, hurricanes, 
winter storms, and other eligible disasters.
    In early conversations about the need for 2022 emergency relief 
assistance, USDA informed Congress that the Department estimated 
disaster-impacted producers incurred at least $10 billion in uncovered 
losses. Actual numbers are closer to $12 billion in uncovered losses 
for 2022 disasters. However, Congress chose to only provide $3.2 
billion in funding for uncovered crop losses and an additional $494.5 
million for uncovered livestock losses.
    Given that available funding for crop losses (approximately $3.2 
billion) was substantially less than the estimated costs to adequately 
cover the disaster losses for 2022, USDA designed a program to deliver 
more benefits to the majority of producers within those funding 
constraints. USDA made every effort to incorporate lessons learned from 
our previous disaster programs and glean important input from 
producers, commodity groups, members of Congress, and other stakeholder 
groups before opening the program for applications. The end result was 
a more advantageous, equitable distribution of the limited funds to 
more producers in need of assistance. Specifically in your home state 
of Mississippi, the ERP 2022 progressive factoring option resulted in 
more advantageous than the flat factor for 76% of Mississippi program 
participants, approximately 2,135 producers.

    Question 9. Mr. Secretary, in light of the recent Federal court 
case impacting the use of the herbicide dicamba, is your office of 
pesticide programs communicating with the EPA to make sure they 
understand the critical situation this court ruling makes for growers 
who have purchased this product for the growing season and are 
requesting that the EPA issue a flexible existing stocks order on this 
for 2024 use?
    Answer. Yes, our Office of Pest Management Policy is communicating 
with EPA on this issue. We were happy to see that EPA is allowing over-
the-top dicamba product to move through channels of trade for use 
during the 2024 growing season using its existing stock provisions, 
though we are hearing that some clarity is needed around that policy 
for distributers. We will stay abreast of this important issue as we 
know this situation is of critical concern to soybean and cotton 
growers.

    Question 10. Mr. Secretary, could you provide insights into how 
agricultural industries can lead the way in implementing strategies to 
address environmental concerns within the agriculture sector while 
ensuring reliable agricultural production?
    Answer. Maintaining and improving productivity of U.S. agriculture 
is critical for both feeding the world and continuing to be responsible 
environmental stewards. The U.S. agricultural sector has and will 
continue to lead the way through practicing the following strategies 
that both address environmental concerns while also continuing to 
maintain productivity.

  <bullet> Maintain and improve soil health--reducing emissions and 
        enhancing soil carbon sequestration;

  <bullet> Improved nitrogen management--implementing the 4 R's of 
        nitrogen management, reducing nitrous oxide emissions, and 
        protecting water quality;

  <bullet> Livestock partnerships--reducing potent methane emissions 
        from manure and protecting water quality;

  <bullet> Improved grazing--reducing emissions, building or 
        maintaining soil carbon stocks, and improving animal 
        production;

  <bullet> Agroforestry, forestry, and wildlife--building and 
        maintaining carbon stocks in perennial biomass and soils;

  <bullet> Restoration of disturbed lands--reducing erosion and 
        improving the quality of previously mined or degraded lands to 
        increase soil and perennial biomass carbon stocks;

  <bullet> Energy, combustion, and electricity efficiency--reducing 
        emissions from agricultural operations and infrastructure 
        through reduced energy and fossil fuel use;

  <bullet> Wetlands--restoring wetlands to enhance carbon storage in 
        soils and vegetation;

  <bullet> Alternate wetting and drying irrigation systems in rice--
        reducing methane emissions from rice fields through irrigation 
        and water management.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Don Bacon, a Representative in Congress 
        from Nebraska
    Question 1. It is our understanding that USDA currently reports in 
its USDA's Cropland Data Layer database a single number for converted 
grassland acres. Because this single number does not differentiate 
between acres rotated from perennial cover into crops and those acres 
converted from native grassland or range into row crops, it is 
difficult to distinguish between the two types of acreage. This could 
have future implications with foreign trading partners whose policies 
might not capture the differences in acreage if the USDA cannot 
differentiate between the data.
    What is the USDA's rationale for reporting this single number for 
converted grassland acres?
    Has the USDA considered changing the reporting to differentiate 
between the two types of acreage mentioned above?
    Answer. The Census of Agriculture and published official 
statistics, which are based primarily on surveys, are considered the 
authoritative sources when measuring and reporting pasture/grassland 
and crop acreage via the NASS Quickstats (https://
quickstats.nass.usda.gov/) database. NASS does not report on land 
conversions or differentiate between acres rotated from perennial cover 
into crops and those acres converted from native grassland or rangeland 
into row crops. However, rotational/conversion analysis can be 
performed by either industry or affiliated USDA agencies using 
published NASS data.
    The USDA NASS Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is a land cover 
classification based on satellite imagery that is derived using USDA/
FSA Common Land Unit as training data and published annually. The 
purpose of the CDL is to provide supplemental planted acreage estimates 
to the NASS Agricultural Statistics Board for major commodities. The 
accuracy is excellent for large area row crops but much lower for 
grasslands. The CDL identifies planted/tilled crops for the growing 
season and does not inform on land cover/land use change or land 
conversions. Additionally, NASS does not provide data services to 
analyze land cover or land use change; it publishes what was planted 
during the growing season via the CDL. The NASS data portal of 
CroplandCROS (https://croplandcros.scinet.usda.gov/) can be used for 
change analysis or visualization by data users.
    NASS does not use the CDL to produce any reports/statistics on 
grassland/cropland conversions. There is a historical catalog of CDL 
data, so it is likely users/industry have attempted to derive their own 
calculations of grassland conversion, such as ``Recent land use change 
in the Western Corn Belt threatens grasslands and wetlands'' https://
www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1215404110  from 2013 and 
``Accuracy, Bias, and Improvements in Mapping Crops and Cropland across 
the United States Using the USDA Cropland Data Layer'' https://
www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/5/968  from 2021.
    It is very challenging to accurately identify perennial grasses vs. 
pasture/grasslands using satellite imagery. Definitionally it is 
difficult to identify via satellite whether a unit of land is pasture/
grassland used for farming intentions with or without the presence of 
livestock or simply native grasses. Thus, the CDL is not the best 
indicator of pasture/grazing land, albeit it is highly accurate for the 
identification of major commodities. Determinations of land conversions 
are left to the researchers for their reporting based on the available 
datasets.
    In summary, NASS does not report on land conversions or 
differentiate between acres rotated from perennial cover into crops and 
those acres converted from native grassland or rangeland into row 
crops. The CDL is not well suited for that purpose.

    Question 2. Mr. Secretary, about a year and half ago (November 
2022), USDA proposed to cut the amount of milk in the WIC program, so 
pregnant women, nursing mothers, infants, toddlers and young children, 
would each get less milk and dairy. Since then, bipartisan House 
Members sent a letter urging you not to go forward with that milk cut. 
The House Agriculture Appropriations bill includes a provision that 
would ensure any changes to the WIC food package would not cut milk.
    I've heard USDA say that increases in WIC participation will 
increase milk sales in WIC. But USDA's own analysis of the proposed 
rule shows a net-decrease (cut) in redemptions for WIC's milk/dairy 
category: which would translate into a $25 million increase per year 
decrease in milk redemptions and at least a $7.5 million per year 
decrease in cheese redemptions. That demonstrates this cut in milk and 
dairy in WIC is real and will have real consequences for WIC moms and 
their children. But this isn't about milk sales. This is about cutting 
the amount of milk for each mother, infant and toddler in the WIC 
program and harming their nutrition. Milk is one of the top items 
redeemed in WIC and one of the items fully utilized. And there is 
survey data showing that 76% of WIC moms oppose this cut, including 20% 
who say they would not re-enroll and another 34% unsure if they would 
stay in the WIC program if this cut goes forward.
    Can you tell the Committee if you still plan to go forward with 
cutting milk in USDA's final rule modifying the WIC food package?

    Answer. By law, USDA is required to conduct scientific reviews of 
the WIC Food Packages and update them, as needed, to reflect the latest 
nutrition science and public health needs, while also recognizing the 
supplemental nature of the package.
    Although the intention of WIC is to provide a variety of under-
consumed nutrients in supplemental amounts, the current WIC food 
packages provide more than a supplemental amount of milk, amounting to 
85 to 128 percent of the total dairy recommended by the Dietary 
Guidelines. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and 
Medicine (NASEM) recommended--and USDA proposed--modest decreases in 
the amount of milk provided to align with the supplemental nature of 
the program. At the proposed levels, WIC would still provide milk 
equivalent to 71 to 96 percent of the total amounts of dairy 
recommended by the Dietary Guidelines.
    The Department anticipates the comprehensive set of changes made in 
this final rule align with nutrition science and consumer preferences 
and will result in more participants fully redeeming their food 
benefits. For example, the proposed rule would provide more flexibility 
for states to authorize a variety of container sizes allowed for 
yogurt. Paired with these added flexibilities, we still expect USDA to 
spend around $900 million on dairy products per year in WIC. Put in 
context, the decrease we estimated in spending on milk and cheese 
represents only about 2% of WIC's annual spending on dairy overall.
    USDA is committed to modernizing the WIC program to best serve 
participants and maximize the reach of the program's proven benefits. 
USDA anticipates that our efforts to modernize WIC, coupled with 
efforts to create a more appealing food package, will increase WIC 
participation, and subsequently help more families access dairy 
benefits as well as other nutritious foods.

    Question 3. Crop production is a key part of my district's economy, 
and we depend on exports to keep demand strong. Secretary, we 
appreciate your clear acknowledgement of the importance of trade in the 
announcement of the Regional Ag Promotion Program. As you know, the 
Market Access Program and the Foreign Market Development program are 
also vital tools to bolster current market access and find new 
opportunities. It is my view that the RAPP program is supplemental to 
the MAP and FMD programs, and should not serve to replace the 
longstanding investments that MAP and FMD have cultivated over time.
    Could you share your views about the importance of export promotion 
in general?
    Do you agree that RAPP is supplemental to MAP and FMD, given that 
there are different markets targeted in RAPP as well as different 
parameters in place for eligibility?
    Answer. Export promotion is vitally important for the success of 
American farmers. Trade promotion investment helps keep existing 
markets open and creates access to new markets. Exports to these 
markets provide income directly back to U.S. farmers and producers. For 
decades, USDA's Market Access Program (MAP) and Foreign Market 
Development (FMD) program have been very successful in expanding U.S. 
exports to markets across the globe. A study on the economic impact of 
these programs determined that the U.S. agricultural export value 
increased by $24 for every dollar invested in export market 
development. These programs provide a significant boost to the U.S. 
agricultural industry, which in turn helps strengthen the economy not 
just in rural communities, but across the entire United States.
    Successful market development takes time and significant resources, 
however, MAP and FMD funding has remained level since 2006. The new 
Regional Agricultural Promotion Program (RAPP), which is utilizing the 
critical CCC funds, is designed to complement MAP and FMD by supporting 
eligible projects that enable exporters to break into new markets and 
increase market share in growth markets. Market diversification is an 
important tool for maximizing growth opportunities for U.S. 
agriculture, and to hedge the risk of market contraction and general 
volatility in the global marketplace. Given the significant investment 
necessary to open and develop new export markets, RAPP will help 
provide that start-up capital so that American exporters can diversify 
their markets and create new opportunities. RAPP encourages exporters 
to establish, build, and grow their presence in regions like South and 
Southeast Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Africa, markets 
with growing middle classes and increased demand for U.S. products.

    Question 4. Corn exports are a key part of my district and the 
Cornhusker State's economy and corn growers are not unique among other 
U.S. agriculture commodities in facing challenges with expanding access 
in export markets. For example, corn exports to our key customers have 
dropped in recent years, and Brazil has claimed market share. As you 
are well aware, once market share has been lost, it is fairly difficult 
to get back. Obviously, I am acutely aware of USTR's primary role in 
negotiating trade agreements or other trade initiatives.
    However, can you share how USDA is working with USTR to underscore 
the need for a proactive approach so that our competitors do not 
continue to gain market share and capture opportunities that would have 
otherwise been ours?
    Additionally, how is USDA working to resolve SPS and technical 
barriers?
    Answer. Last year, USDA worked with USTR, foreign governments, 
international organizations, and our private sector partners to reduce 
and eliminate trade barriers for U.S. exports, preserving more than 
$6.4 billion in overall U.S. agricultural exports. USDA continues to 
actively work together with USTR to prevent market share loss. USDA 
continues to raise specific trade concerns for sanitary and 
phytosanitary (SPS) and technical barriers to trade during annual 
committee meetings, as well as through official USG comments to the 
WTO.
    In addition, USDA provides trade capacity building to current and 
emerging trading partners to promote international trade and open 
markets for U.S. agricultural exports--creating predictable and 
transparent trade environments favorable to U.S. agricultural exports. 
USDA oversees projects that help U.S. trading partners understand and 
implement science-based international SPS standards and practices, as 
well as managing projects that address technical barriers to trade and 
trade facilitation. USDA collaborates with domestic and international 
experts to help build the institutional regulatory capacity of our 
trading partners to expand and ensure predictable market access for 
U.S. exporters.

    Question 5. New export market opportunities exist all around the 
globe and will play a critical part in the years to come as our export 
markets shift.
    In your opinion, where are some areas of the world that present 
potential for U.S. agriculture exports, particularly beef, pork, corn, 
and soybeans?
    Answer. USDA remain laser-focused on expanding trade and market 
opportunities for U.S. food and agricultural products and building on 
significant wins under the Biden-Harris Administration to break into 
new markets. Since 2021, we have actively engaged with trading partners 
to reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers for more than $21 billion of 
U.S. agricultural exports.
    USDA is also investing in a variety of initiatives to boost U.S. 
exports to a variety of global markets, with an emphasis on markets 
with large and growing middle-class populations. The $1.2 billion USDA 
investment to implement the Regional Agricultural Promotion Program 
(RAPP) complements other traditional export market development and 
promotion programs to enhance exporters' ability to diversify into new 
markets and increase market share in growth markets.
    When it comes to U.S. pork and pork exports, USDA works closely 
with U.S. industry representatives to understand and identify key 
markets with growth and export potential for U.S. products. Beyond 
maintaining traditional markets such as Mexico, Canada, Australia, and 
China, we see opportunity for export growth of U.S. pork to countries 
such as the Dominican Republic and Central American countries and 
hopefully South Africa and Jamaica once barriers can be removed.
    Similarly, in addition to the goal to maintain market share in our 
traditional beef markets of South Korea, Japan, Mexico, Canada, and 
now, China, we also see opportunity for U.S. beef in markets such as 
Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines, which have burgeoning 
populations and high middle-class growth. We also think Africa presents 
opportunities for U.S. beef.
    With respect to corn and soybean exports, USDA is actively working 
to maintain markets for corn in countries such as Mexico, Japan, and 
China. Soybean exports are also being maintained in China, the EU, and 
Mexico. With USDA's new RAPP specifically targeting Africa, we view 
this as an opportunity to build momentum for U.S. beef, corn, and 
soybean exports to the region.

    Question 6. Mexico is the number one destination for U.S. corn 
exports, and in fact 47.5% of our total corn exports go to our southern 
neighbor. As you know, Mexico's biotech ban on certain uses of biotech 
corn has already had an impact on U.S. corn exports and it threatens to 
upend market access to our most important customer if Mexico's corn 
decree is fully implemented. We appreciate the work of USTR and USDA in 
launching the dispute settlement process under USMCA.
    How has USDA been coordinating with USTR to ensure that the U.S. 
position is successful, and that the panelists can vividly see that the 
science is on our side?
    Answer. Addressing this issue through the USMCA dispute resolution 
process is a top priority for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
and the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR). Under 
the USMCA, we and our partners have jointly agreed to maintain science-
based measures to protect human, animal, and plant life and health. For 
decades, our system has ensured that commercialized biotech-improved 
products are as safe as conventional counterparts--and it will continue 
to do so. This USMCA dispute is currently in active litigation, and 
USDA is working very closely with USTR to ensure U.S. corn growers have 
full and fair access to the Mexican market.

    Question 7. Kenya presents a market access opportunity for 
agricultural exports, including corn and soybeans. Kenya's view of 
biotechnology has shifted in recent years, perhaps providing an 
opportunity for access. I understand access for biotechnology products 
depends on the Kenyan court system, but simultaneously, the U.S.'s 
trade talks with Kenya can also tackle barriers related to ag biotech.
    How is USDA working with USTR to capitalize on this momentum in 
order to create tangible benefits for American growers?
    When do you expect negotiations to conclude?
    Answer. USDA is committed to working alongside USTR to emphasize 
science and risk-based decision making amongst trading partners. While 
market access for agricultural biotechnology products is reliant upon a 
positive outcome from the court system in Kenya, USDA is also working 
continuously to facilitate connections between U.S. industry and Kenyan 
counterparts.
    Over the past few years, USDA has funded approximately $186,000 of 
Market Access Program (MAP), Foreign Market Development (FMD), and 
Emerging Markets Program (EMP) projects in Kenya, supporting the work 
of our agricultural commodity and trade association cooperators. In 
2024, pending the Government of Kenya's approval, the U.S. Grains 
Council anticipates fulfilling a 60 metric ton shipment of dried 
distillers' dried grain with solubles (DDGS) containing products of 
agricultural biotechnology under USDA's Quality Samples Program (QSP); 
with this first shipment, potential customers will be able to discover 
the benefits of U.S. DDGs. Through engagements and programs, such as 
the QSP, MAP, EMP, FMD, or USDA's new Regional Agricultural Promotion 
Program (RAPP), USDA will continue to capitalize on momentum created by 
trade talks to support opportunities for growers of agricultural 
biotechnology products.
    USDA continues to work alongside USTR on the U.S.-Kenya Strategic 
Trade and Investment Partnership (STIP). The agriculture team is making 
tremendous progress and is working hard to improve bilateral trade for 
all agricultural stakeholders. We are looking forward to a positive 
outcome in the near future.

    Question 8. Taiwan is an important trading partner and regional 
ally of the United States. The U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st Century 
Trade is a step in the right direction to embolden our relationship. I 
understand that trade discussions with Taiwan are still active but are 
likely to address agricultural issues like biotechnology and pesticide 
maximum residue levels. How is USDA ensuring that market access 
opportunities present in Taiwan will be harnessed throughout 
discussions on this initiative?
    Answer. The discussions around the U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st-
Century Trade are indeed active. The United States is pursuing high-
standard commitments to enhance market access for American farmers, 
ranchers, workers, and businesses. For example, we are seeking 
disciplines to ensure that sanitary and phytosanitary measures are 
science-based, and developed and implemented in a transparent, 
predictable, and non-discriminatory manner. These provisions are 
intended to provide tools to tackle a wide range of barriers to safe, 
wholesome U.S. agricultural products, and thereby increase access to 
the Taiwan market for U.S. agriculture.
    In addition to bilateral efforts with Taiwan and other partners, 
USDA aims to create more opportunities for market access for U.S. 
agricultural products through international organizations such as Codex 
Alimentarius and the World Trade Organization. USDA, along with other 
government agencies, is working to achieve the best possible outcomes 
for American farmers, ranchers, and producers.

    Question 9. In the 2022/2023 marketing year, the U.S. exported 1.25 
billion gallons of ethanol, equivalent to 423 million bushels of corn. 
Ethanol imports offer several advantages to foreign customers who are 
seeking fuel options that are less carbon intensive. The U.S. has 
historically exported ethanol into Brazil. However, Brazil applied a 16 
percent tariff on ethanol imports in 2022 that rose to 18 percent last 
month, which has essentially closed off market access for the U.S. How 
is USDA prioritizing market access opportunities for ethanol and 
working to address Brazil's trade action?
    Answer. USDA continues to support U.S. ethanol market access 
opportunities through engagement and programs, such as the Market 
Access Program (MAP), Foreign Market Development (FMD), and USDA's new 
Regional Agricultural Promotion Program (RAPP). USDA actively engages 
our foreign counterparts around the world to resolve both tariff and 
non-tariff trade barriers, including in coordination with the U.S. 
industry to resolve issues they are facing.
    USDA continues to actively engage with Brazil, in coordination with 
the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, to address the restrictive 
tariff imposed on U.S. ethanol. This engagement has included 
government-to-government dialogues and meetings. USDA has also actively 
engaged with Brazilian regulators on their low carbon fuel policy, 
RenovaBio, seeking technical corrections that will allow U.S. ethanol 
to be certified under the program. Through these and other engagements, 
and despite exports dropping more than 99 percent to Brazil, 2023 was a 
record year for U.S. ethanol exports, valued at over $3.8 billion, an 
increase of three percent from 2022. Volume-wise, U.S. ethanol exports 
amounted to over 5.4 billion liters in 2023, a nine percent increase 
from nearly 5 billion liters in 2022.

    Question 10. USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service and its Brussels 
Office support U.S. agriculture on a myriad of new regulations coming 
out of the European Union's Farm to Fork policy. Importantly, the 
European Parliament rejected legislation to cut the use of pesticides 
in the EU and also passed legislation on a regulatory approach for new 
genomic techniques. At the same time, the EU is banning neonicotinoid 
use, even on imports, based on environmental criteria in third 
countries, not food safety. The environmental conditions and pest 
pressures in the United States or Kenya or Vietnam have no similarity 
to those in the European Union. With European farmers calling on their 
policy makers to force farmers around the world to follow the same 
strict requirements as European farmers and agribusinesses, what is the 
prospect of maintaining the EU as an export market and ensuring that 
European regulations do not act as unwarranted trade barriers. What 
more can USDA do, in cooperation with industry, to ensure regulations 
are science based, non-discriminatory and taken for legitimate food 
safety, plant health and animal health reasons?
    Answer. Maintaining market access to the European Union for 
America's farmers is a key priority for USDA. USDA teams in Washington 
work closely with our agricultural attaches in Brussels and at the 
national level in EU Member States to monitor the complex and evolving 
regulatory landscape in Europe and alert our growers and ranchers of 
upcoming issues that may result in trade issues. USDA is committed to 
addressing technical or sanitary and phytosanitary trade barriers such 
as burdensome requirements related to reductions in pesticide maximum 
residue levels, contaminant maximum levels, labeling, or certification 
requirements which otherwise may negatively impact our specialty and 
commodity crop producers from shipping high-quality products overseas.
    USDA agencies work closely with our interagency partners, 
including, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as others, to ensure that 
regulations are science-based and taken for legitimate reasons. USDA 
engages bilaterally with the EU partners with USTR at the World Trade 
Organization (WTO) in support of U.S. agricultural producers and 
exporters.
    The United States Codex Office (USCO), located in USDA, 
participates in the development of international food safety and 
commodity standards. USCO works with USDA agencies and interagency 
partners to build support for U.S. policy positions and to counter 
policies that are not based on sound science, completed risk 
assessments, and reflective of international norms.
    In addition to efforts within the EU, USDA supports projects 
designed to counter EU regulatory influence in third countries. Some 
countries apply hazard-based approaches to regulation based on the end 
market for their exports (e.g., the EU) or because of a lack of 
technical knowledge or enforcement of international risk-based 
practices and measures. USDA works with third countries to strengthen 
their use of science and risk in regulatory development and their 
engagement in the rules-based trading system. This work will continue 
and expand under the new Assisting Specialty Crop Exports (ASCE) 
initiative.

    Question 11. Mr. Secretary, I am concerned about growing foreign 
threats to agriculture like ownership of farmland, acquiring American 
agricultural technology, or stealing innovations and research from 
companies and universities. The recent House Select Committee on 
Strategic Competition with China suggested the Secretary of Agriculture 
should be added to CFIUS as voting member. What is the role of USDA 
across government in countering foreign threats to agriculture and what 
agencies at USDA are currently responsible?
    Answer. As a result of discussions between USDA and the Treasury 
Secretary, USDA's role in CFIUS has grown. Each week, Treasury sends 
the USDA Office of Homeland Security CFIUS Program (OHS/CFIUS) a Case 
Log listing new and active CFIUS cases, as well as a Directorate of 
National Intelligence (DNI) Summary of each new case the Committee has 
started to review that week. Within 5 business days of receipt, USDA 
must assess these summaries for agricultural equities. If there are 
agricultural interests, USDA notifies Treasury that it would like to 
review the full case filing. With respect to such cases, USDA becomes a 
full participant in the CFIUS review process, evaluating if there is a 
national security risk and, if so, if that risk can be mitigated. USDA 
has been operating under this structure for approximately 18 months. 
Last year there were over 400 CFIUS cases filed at Treasury and 
reviewed at USDA.
    Within the Department, CFIUS work is led by a small team in the 
Office of Homeland Security. However, CFIUS work is done in conjunction 
with the Office of the General Counsel, the Office of the Secretary, 
and subject matter experts, as appropriate, from across the Department 
to best inform each case to which we are party. USDA can provide a wide 
range of expertise in cases related to agriculture, agribusiness, 
forestry, rural utilities or housing, or any other such issue area that 
falls under the Department's purview.

    Question 11a. How can (What actions have been taken and how can) 
USDA more proactively engage industry and land-grant universities to 
help analyze, identify, counter, and mitigate potential threats to 
agriculture?
    Answer. Engaging industry and land-grant universities in analyzing, 
identifying, countering, and mitigating threats to agriculture requires 
a whole-of-government approach. USDA shares resources available from 
the U.S. law enforcement and intelligence community with USDA 
stakeholders. USDA is committed to protecting USDA investments in 
science, technology, and innovation. International cooperation can 
accelerate discoveries that contribute to the health and well-being of 
the American people, while informing and working to solve global 
challenges. However, cooperation should be conducted in a manner that 
is mutually beneficial, while protecting USDA investments and, 
subsequently, U.S. economic and national security.
    Finally, USDA has funded research with industry partners and land 
grant universities to study and address emerging threats to 
agriculture. This includes research on plant pests, diseases, and 
invasive species.

    Question 11b. What additional resources and/or authority is needed 
to proactively address current and future threats?
    Answer. USDA OHS needs resources to support its sector risk 
management responsibilities and an authority. We have asked for funding 
to support the Food and Agriculture Critical Infrastructure Sector, one 
of the 16 Critical Infrastructure sectors. USDA is open to engaging 
more on this topic. USDA has reviewed with great interest the 
authorities and subsequent resources provided to the National Science 
Foundation (NSF) in the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (H.R. 4346), 
including, but not limited to, establishment of a Research Security and 
Policy office within the Office of the NSF Director with at least four 
full-time staff (Section 10331-10332). The office is charged with 
coordinating all research security policy issues across NSF which 
includes identifying and addressing potential security risks that 
threaten research integrity and other risks to the research enterprise; 
developing research security policy and best practices; conducting 
outreach and education activities for recipients on research policies 
and potential security risks; educating NSF program managers on 
evaluating for potential security risks; communicating reporting and 
disclosure requirements; performing risk assessments of NSF proposals 
and awards using analytical tools to assess nondisclosures of required 
information; establishing policies to ensure compliance with NSPM-33; 
and conducting or facilitating due diligence with regards to 
applications for NSF R&D awards. The CHIPS and Science Act authorizes 
the NSF Office of Research Security and Policy, in coordination with 
the NSF OIG, to conduct risk assessments, including through the use of 
open-source analysis and analytical tools, of research and development 
award applications and disclosure to NSF (Section 10336).

    Question 12. Mr. Secretary, I understand how important it is to see 
food security as national security, and as such I have been a strong 
supporter of the ``three-legged stool'' of animal health. Can you 
please outline any areas of risk the Department sees as we look to 
ensure foreign animal diseases like African Swine Fever, Foot-and-Mouth 
Disease, and others do not enter the United States?
    Answer. We appreciate Congress' support for the new animal health 
programs in the last farm bill. Those have already yielded many 
benefits for us in identifying new techniques for detecting and 
responding to animal health emergencies. We know the diseases that you 
mention are circulating throughout the world and that is why those new 
programs are so important. They build on and enhance the work we 
already do.
    APHIS has a strong system of overlapping safeguards in place and 
works every day to mitigate or eliminate risk of introducing high-
consequence foreign animal diseases. From the regulations that limit 
imports from countries where diseases are present to the extensive 
surveillance network, including the National Animal Health Laboratory 
Network, which looks for and detects possible diseases, APHIS works to 
keep that risk offshore. APHIS also invests in state, Federal, and 
industry partnerships to ensure that diseases are recognized as quickly 
as possible and that producers are familiar with biosecurity practices 
that can protect their livelihoods.
    Further, the agency's Smuggling and Interdiction and Trade 
Compliance program explores domestic pathways for ways illegal goods 
may be smuggled or moved. Just as important is the strong partnership 
we have with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, whose agents and 
detector dogs, all trained by us, serve as the front-line defense, 
looking at passengers and cargo for pathways for pests and diseases and 
ensuring compliance with our science-based regulations.
    The farm bill programs you mentioned have been a great tool in 
helping us prepare for foreign animal diseases. APHIS has invested 
nearly $40M through the National Animal Disease Preparedness and 
Response Program (NADPRP) to support over 180 projects that help 
stakeholders identify potential risks and prepare to respond to the 
most critical animal health threats facing livestock industries today. 
It allows APHIS and its partners to enhance our capacity to respond to 
foreign animal diseases like African Swine Fever and Food and Mouth 
Disease.
    Separate from the authorizations that the Committee has been 
focused on for the farm bill, it is critical for you to understand that 
the discretionary annual appropriations for APHIS to address, prevent, 
and potentially respond to foreign animal diseases is vital to our 
response on animal health. As are the discretionary appropriations to 
support ARS and NIFA related to animal health matters. This Committee 
has followed closely our work in APHIS to mitigate the outbreak of 
highly-pathogenic avian influenza in the poultry industry since the 
first case of HPAI was confirmed in a commercial flock in February 
2022. That immediate response, veterinary expertise, and work to 
educate the industry on biosecurity is dependent on our dedicated APHIS 
employees that rely on discretionary annual appropriations as well as 
some uses of the CCC.
    Lastly, many on the Committee has been closely involved or at least 
closely followed the work to authorize and establish the new National 
Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) in Manhattan, Kansas, an effort 
that has been underway for some 17 years. This state-of-the-art maximum 
biocontainment (BSL-4) facility will be able to study high-consequence 
zoonotic diseases affecting large livestock and will serve as a 
national asset to help protect against the threat and potential impact 
of serious animal diseases. The NBAF facility will serve as a ``One 
Health'' national and international resource, offering capabilities for 
training, research and development, surveillance, prevention, and 
response to emerging infectious diseases. However, the upkeep and 
maintenance of this facility will be critical in continuing USDA's 
foreign animal disease work.

    Question 13. In July 2023, President Biden said: ``Mark my words: 
the next 20 years, farmers are going to be providing 95% of all the 
sustainable airline fuel.'' I know you agree with this vision--you have 
spoken often about the promise of SAF as a new market for U.S. 
agriculture . . . as one part of a biobased economy where each farm can 
become a center of entrepreneurship that is focused on sustainable 
agricultural practices that the market values. This vision of 
homegrown, clean SAF produced by American agriculture is one that I 
think all of us on this Committee can get behind. That is why I am so 
puzzled by the situation with the Administration's guidance on tax 
credits for SAF. In December, the Treasury Department named Argonne 
National Lab's GREET model as a secondary model for calculating tax 
credits for sustainable aviation fuel production. But, rather than use 
the model developed by the independent Argonne National Lab, the 
Administration is unnecessarily changing the GREET model, causing 
delays that are slowing private investment and inserting updates that 
seem to be intended to prevent American farmers from getting credit for 
investments in the very sustainable ag practices that the 
Administration claims to support. Will the Administration meet its 
deadline of March 1 to have the GREET model update completed and will 
the section 40B SAF tax credit be usable by SAF producers on that day?
    Answer. We anticipate that the Biden-Harris Administration will 
issue a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) notice as part of the Investing 
in America agenda. The notice will catalyze innovation in the aviation 
industry, incentivize the production of cleaner, more sustainable 
aviation fuels, and help make the United States a leader in 
decarbonizing the aviation industry. The Treasury Department's Notice 
will provide important clarity around eligibility for the SSAF tax 
credit that was established in the Inflation Reduction Act. The SAF tax 
credit incentivizes the production of SAF that achieves a lifecycle GHG 
emissions reduction of at least 50% as compared with petroleum-based 
jet fuel.

    Question 13a. Please explain how the GREET model update will 
continue to deliver value to farmers by accurately crediting 
conservation practices and emissions reductions from regenerative 
farming, climate smart agriculture, and carbon capture and storage--all 
techniques that could massively lower carbon emissions, if adopted?
    Answer. As part of this effort, the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) and other Federal Government agencies (EPA, DOT/FAA, and DOE) 
will jointly announce the 40B GREET 2024 model. This model provides 
another methodology for SAF producers to determine the lifecycle GHG 
emissions rates of their production for the purposes of the SAF tax 
credit. The 40B tax credit also incorporates a USDA Pilot Program to 
encourage the use of Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) practices for SAF 
feedstocks. We are taking this path because we want to recognize the 
climate benefits of these CSA practices and encourage their adoption, 
but also recognize there is additional work to do to assess 
verification mechanisms, empirical data, and modeling. Incorporating 
CSA practices into the production of SAF provides multiple benefits. 
These include lower overall GHG emissions associated with SAF 
production, improved accuracy of overall carbon intensity estimation, 
sustainable production of domestically-produced aviation fuel, and 
increased adoption of farming practices that are associated with other 
environmental benefits, such as improved water quality and soil health.

    Question 13b. What steps is USDA taking to ensure that the GREET 
modeling update that is underway uses the same rigorous science on 
which the model is based and does not manipulate the model to deliver a 
predetermined outcome, such as excluding ag-based biofuels from 
eligibility for the SAF credit?
    Answer. The modified version of GREET released in conjunction with 
the April 30, 2024, SAF tax credit guidance incorporates new data and 
science, including specific new modeling of key feedstocks and 
processes used in aviation fuel and certain categories of indirect 
emissions. It integrates other categories of indirect emissions--such 
as crop production and livestock activity--in addition to land use 
change emissions informed by GTAP-BIO. The modified GREET model also 
integrates key greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies such as 
carbon capture and storage, renewable natural gas, and renewable 
electricity.

    Question 14. Mr. Secretary, the Agricultural Marketing Service 
(AMS) Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) is important to cattle 
producers who use this data as a base price point when pricing cattle. 
About 99% of pricing formulas use data from LMR. When the data is 
unavailable from this service, chaos and uncertainty occur in the 
cattle market. During the 2013 shutdown, and again in the recent near 
shutdown last fall, LMR was deemed unessential and went dark for 7 
days. Thankfully, we averted a shutdown this past fall, however your 
department informed our offices that you were going to repeat this 
decision in the event of another government shutdown. While we can 
agree that government shutdowns are not the answer to our fiscal 
problems, hanging Nebraska's cattlemen out to dry is not the answer 
either. Why was your department so willing to cause such deep 
disruption to the markets when it was so easily foreseeable and 
avertable?
    In the event of a future government shutdown, can I get your 
commitment to do your part to ensure that the United States government 
continues to provide essential services to America's farmers and 
ranchers like LMR?
    Answer. The Agricultural Marketing Service's Market News 
activities, including Livestock Mandatory Reporting, are 100% funded 
with annually appropriated funds and legally could not and cannot 
continue during a government shutdown without further action from 
Congress. AMS would ask that LMR packers continue to submit data 
voluntarily through the Mandatory Price Reporting System and historical 
reports would continue to be available. I should add that across-the-
board government shutdowns and simply the threat of a shutdown are 
incredibly disruptive. At USDA alone as many as 50,000 workers could be 
furloughed, hurting USDA operations in every county in the country. Far 
beyond these AMS report matters it must be stressed how disruptive a 
shutdown is and that there are real consequences to real people in a 
real way.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Mike Bost, a Representative in Congress 
        from Illinois
    Question 1. Protecting U.S. farmland from being gobbled up by 
foreign adversaries is a matter of national security. As of December 
2022, foreign investors held an interest in over 43.4 million acres of 
U.S. agricultural land.\11\ This is up 3.4 million acres from 2021.

EPAS/PDF/2022_afida_an-
nual_report_12_14_23.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Last month, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a 
report which found that USDA has not been accurately recording foreign 
investment data and that USDA has not been sharing the data it does 
have in a timely manner.\12\ This is a national security risk in more 
ways than one.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \12\ https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-106337.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    By sharing data with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the 
United States (CFIUS) only once a year, USDA is creating space for 
foreign bad actors to go unnoticed for months. This is particularly 
concerning with foreign investments near military installations, like 
Scott Air Force Base in my district, the headquarters of the U.S. 
Transportation Command. This military base oversees all transportation 
for the Department of Defense.
    Another concern of mine with foreign investment in U.S. 
agricultural land is the number of acres that are being converted to 
non-agricultural uses, like solar energy. From the foreign investment 
data that USDA did collect for my district, more than half is being 
repurposed for solar panel development or non-agricultural uses.\13\ 
While I am not opposed to solar energy in general, I am opposed to 
taking prime farmland out of production for the sake of solar panels.

policy-analysis/afida/agricultural-foreign-investment-disclosure-act-
afida/index.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    All in all, I believe there needs to be more oversight on foreign 
investment in U.S. agricultural land and that USDA needs to be more 
detailed in both their data collection and communication skills with 
other agencies. That being said, I respectfully request responses to 
the following questions:
    Has USDA reviewed the GAO's report recommendations and what actions 
will the Department take to address these issues? Do you have an 
anticipated timeline for their implementation?
    Answer. GAO made six recommendations, including that USDA share 
detailed and timely Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act 
(AFIDA) data with CFIUS agencies, improve reliability of AFIDA data, 
and assess its ability to adopt an online submission system and public 
database. USDA generally agreed with GAO's recommendations and noted 
the need for financial assistance.
    In the FY 2024, full-year budget, AFIDA received $1 million in 
funding. We are appreciative of this funding, but also note that the 
total Farm Production and Conservation--Business Center (FPAC-BC) funds 
were reduced to provide for AFIDA. Those funds that were reduced 
account for staff and expenses for the FPAC-BC as a whole. Further, the 
$1 million is insufficient to complete implementation for the build-out 
of a modern solution that allows FPAC's efficient management of AFIDA 
filings. Without an additional appropriation of funding sufficient for 
the development and maintenance of an online filing portal and funding 
for IT staffing, it will be difficult to provide more real-time filings 
to meet the mandate of Sec. 773 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 
2023. Part of that mandate involves creating and maintaining an online 
filing portal; the other part involves development of a public AFIDA 
database. The first step in developing an online filing system involves 
ensuring we are collecting the appropriate data. USDA convened an 
internal, inter-agency working group in 2023 to develop a new AFIDA 
form that is more precise and more accurately captures leaseholds and 
impacts of foreign investment as a first step in portal creation. The 
proposed form was published in the Federal Register in December 2023 
and the comment period closed in February 2024. We are assessing 
comments.

    Question 2. Additionally, can you speak to the role that USDA 
currently plays in being consulted on foreign investment reviews at 
CFIUS? Do you think further coordination between USDA and CFIUS is 
warranted?
    Answer. As a result of discussions between the USDA and the 
Treasury, USDA's role in CFIUS has grown. Each week, Treasury sends the 
USDA Office of Homeland Security CFIUS Program (OHS/CFIUS) a Case Log 
listing new and active CFIUS cases, as well as a Directorate of 
National Intelligence (DNI) Summary of each new case the Committee has 
started to review that week. Within 5 business days of receipt, USDA 
must assess these summaries for agricultural equities. If there are 
agricultural interests, USDA notifies Treasury that it would like to 
review the full case filing. With respect to such cases, USDA becomes a 
full participant in the CFIUS review process, evaluating if there is a 
national security risk and, if so, if that risk can be mitigated. This 
status is also reflected in CFIUS language in the Agriculture, Rural 
Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Fiscal 
Year 2024 Appropriations Bill.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Dusty Johnson, a Representative in Congress 
        from South Dakota
    Question 1. Mr. Secretary, I appreciate your comments regarding the 
Administration's work on vaccination for highly-pathogenic avian 
influenza (HPAI). As you continue working on this important matter, I 
would like to bring to your attention a letter I sent along with five 
of my colleagues to you regarding the potential for platform vaccine 
technology to help quickly develop new vaccinations. Has your 
Administration considered the use of platform vaccine technology to 
combat the spread of HPAI? Would the use of this technology alter the 
timeline for deployment, or future response to other strains of HPAI?
    Answer. We are always looking at ways to strengthen animal health 
outcomes and platform vaccine technology may be an effective tool for 
vaccination. While the intent of the platform approach is to 
standardize some of the materials and manufacturing to expedite some of 
the regulatory requirements, it is still critical to demonstrate the 
safety and efficacy of these products. USDA has already licensed 
several platform technologies.
    Vaccines manufactured using this technology are promising with 
regard to the speed with which the product is made available to the 
market. It could work similarly for highly-pathogenic avian influenza 
but will require some additional studies to demonstrate the 
effectiveness in the field as well as in providing efficient delivery 
systems that factor in how poultry is produced in this country.

    Question 2. As you know, USDA approved the regulatory framework for 
platform technologies during your previous tenure as Secretary. Beyond 
highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), what opportunities are there 
for UDSA to engage more significantly with the private sector to 
optimize platform technologies in USDA's work on foreign animal disease 
surveillance and prevention? Can you commit to such collaboration and 
engagement, so we are utilizing all resources and technologies at our 
disposal to help protect all sectors of our livestock industry?
    Answer. We are always happy to meet with our stakeholders and learn 
more about their innovative ideas. We have previously met with 
companies that produce platform technologies to learn more about them 
and how they can help protect animal health. One thing we have told 
them to consider is the tool Congress gave us in the last farm bill. 
The National Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program could be 
a great resource for vaccine developers to partner with states, 
universities, or industry on projects that could demonstrate the 
importance of this technology or further continue its development. 
Vaccine developers are welcome to submit proposals, which we consider 
through a competitive program subject to available funding.

    Question 3. Mr. Secretary, new export market opportunities exist 
all around the globe, and will play a critical part in the years to 
come as our export markets shift. In your opinion, where are some areas 
of the world that present potential for U.S. agriculture exports?
    Answer. Diversifying export market opportunities is important for 
maximizing growth for U.S. farmers, ranchers, and foresters, as well as 
to hedge the risk of market contraction and general volatility in the 
global marketplace. While we remain committed to our established 
customer base around the world, we are also setting our sights on new 
growth opportunities in places like Africa, Latin America, the Middle 
East, and Southeast Asia. Africa especially has untapped market 
potential with the 2019 ratification of the African Continental Free 
Trade Area and a drive towards more integrated trade on the continent. 
By 2050, one in four people on the planet will be on the African 
continent. That is huge untapped potential. Likewise, countries in 
Latin America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia who are experiencing 
rapid GDP growth, expanding middle classes, urbanizing populations, and 
increasingly modern food retail systems are prime markets for 
establishing lifelong consumers of U.S. food and agricultural products.
    USDA is also investing in a variety of initiatives to boost U.S. 
exports to a variety of global markets, with an emphasis on markets 
with large and growing middle-class populations. The $1.2 billion USDA 
investment to implement the Regional Agricultural Promotion Program 
(RAPP) complements other traditional export market development and 
promotion programs to enhance exporters' ability to diversify into new 
markets and increase market share in growth markets.

    Question 4. Mr. Secretary, in the 2022-2023 marketing year, the 
U.S. exported 1.25 billion gallons of ethanol. These exports offer 
several advantages to foreign customers who are seeking renewable fuel 
options. The U.S. has historically exported ethanol into Brazil. 
However, Brazil applied a 16% tariff on ethanol imports in 2022 that 
then rose to 18% last month--essentially closing off market access for 
the U.S. How is USDA prioritizing market access opportunities for 
ethanol and working to address Brazil's trade action?
    Answer. USDA continues to support U.S. ethanol market access 
opportunities through engagement and programs, such as the Market 
Access Program (MAP), Foreign Market Development (FMD) program, and 
USDA's new Regional Agricultural Promotion Program (RAPP). USDA 
actively engages our foreign counterparts around the world to resolve 
both tariff and non-tariff trade barriers, including in coordination 
with the U.S. industry to resolve issues they are facing.
    For example, in 2023, FAS tirelessly worked to expand U.S. ethanol 
market access to Japan in the update to their biofuels policy so U.S. 
ethanol can meet 100 percent of the market, an increase from a market 
share of roughly 66 percent. Efforts also included obtaining 
legislative recognition on land use and biodiversity criteria under 
Canada's Clean Fuel Regulation (CFR), maintaining nearly $3 billion of 
U.S. ethanol and biodiesel exports by removing potential trade barriers 
for U.S. participation under the CFR and establishing a new blending 
program in Panama which should lead to increased U.S. ethanol exports 
and serve as a global example for new biofuels policies. Vietnam and 
India also lowered their import tariffs on ethanol which will increase 
price competitiveness of U.S. ethanol for increased exports. Additional 
efforts, including in coordination within the U.S. government 
interagency, continue on these and other markets to support increased 
emphasis on U.S. biofuels in a variety of international forums to 
provide further weight to our U.S. biofuels requests.
    USDA continues to actively engage with Brazil, in coordination with 
the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, to address the restrictive 
tariff imposed on U.S. ethanol. This engagement has included 
government-to-government dialogues and meetings. USDA has also actively 
engaged with Brazilian regulators on their low carbon fuel policy, 
RenovaBio, seeking technical corrections that will allow U.S. ethanol 
to be certified under the program. Through these and other engagements, 
and despite exports dropping more than 99 percent to Brazil, 2023 was a 
record year for U.S. ethanol exports, valued at over $3.8 billion, an 
increase of 3 percent from 2022. Volume-wise, U.S. ethanol exports 
amounted to over 5.4 billion liters in 2023, a 9 percent increase from 
nearly 5 billion liters in 2022.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Tracey Mann, a Representative in Congress 
        from Kansas
    Question 1. Thank you for your comments regarding the importance of 
animal disease traceability. As we discussed, I am supportive of USDA's 
electronic identification rulemaking as it would enhance our ability to 
rapidly trace diseases and outbreaks in cattle and bison covered in 
official USDA interstate movement. However, I am concerned that 
agricultural producers in Kansas and across the country would be 
responsible for the cost. APHIS currently provides free EID tags and 
financial assistance for related infrastructure to prepare for 
compliance efforts with the regulation. Is USDA open to offsetting 
costs to producers through the Animal Health Technical Services account 
where voluntary EID tags are currently funded?
    Will USDA use other funding resources, such as the National Animal 
Disease Preparedness and Response Program, to pay for the rulemaking?
    Answer. In response to the concerns that you have heard from 
producers, the Committee passed FY 2024 Agriculture Appropriations bill 
included $10 million for the purchase of Electronic Identification 
(EID) tags and related infrastructure. USDA is hopeful that the final 
FY 2024 Appropriations bill will include necessary resources to help 
USDA to provide tags to producers free of charge to jump-start efforts 
to transition to this new system and help enable the fastest possible 
response to animal disease. The science is clear that traceability is 
necessary for controlling both fast-moving diseases, like foot-and-
mouth disease, as well as slower-moving diseases, like bovine 
tuberculosis and brucellosis. This system will allow us to not only 
show our trading partners proof of where animals have been, thus 
protecting export markets, but it also helps guarantee rapid response 
in the event of an animal disease emergency.

    Question 2. With more than $166 billion in Federal funding directed 
to broadband in the last 5 years, how will USDA ensure that the money 
will not duplicate--and will compliment--existing funding 
opportunities?
    Answer. USDA meets regularly and on an ad hoc basis with the FCC/
NTIA/Treasury to ensure that Federal dollars are spent in the most 
efficient way possible. Additionally, USDA shares information with our 
Federal partners regarding the awards made under our programs to enable 
other agencies to take those awards into consideration to ensure 
projects do not overlap or overbuild existing services already made 
available.

    Question 3. The private-sector regularly works to support farmers 
who voluntarily implement conservation practices or choose to try new 
conservation practices. For example, General Mills recently 
commissioned a study that found that for every $1 contributed towards 
regenerative agriculture in the Cheney Lake Watershed, approximately $5 
in additional economic value is generated. How can USDA continue to 
leverage the private sector's work and findings in its own work?
    Answer. Through its technical and financial assistance programs, 
USDA is leveraging work already being done by the private-sector and 
incorporating its research and learnings into USDA's ongoing efforts.
    The Agricultural Conservation Easement Program provides financial 
and technical assistance to help conserve wetlands and sustain their 
benefits to terrestrial and aquatic wildlife. We have multiple 
initiatives to improve water quality. For example, in California, 
through the Bay Delta Initiative, USDA and its local partners are using 
snowmelt information from differing geographic locations within the 
Bay-Delta Plan to address critical water quantity, water quality, and 
habitat restoration needs of the Bay Delta region by implementing 
voluntary conservation on private lands.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Randy Feenstra, a Representative in 
        Congress from Iowa
    Question 1. Does USDA have any information on the impact Prop. 12 
will have on increasing consolidation in the pork industry?
    Answer. No, USDA does not currently have research which examines 
how Proposition 12 may impact consolidation within the pork industry.

    Question 2. NAHLN funding is vital to safeguarding our nation's 
food supply. This funding provides for state of the art testing 
capabilities, enhancing biosecurity, and increasing U.S. emergency 
preparedness. What started with 12 laboratories has now grown to over 
60 through this program. What is USDA doing to ensure this network is 
focused on innovative solutions to animal health threats especially 
during this time of immense growth?
    Answer. NAHLN is the backbone of our surveillance detection network 
and is key to our ability to rapidly detect and respond to foreign 
animal diseases. The new animal health programs in the previous farm 
bill gave APHIS a dedicated stream of funding from the Commodity Credit 
Corporation to enhance this critical network. Since the farm bill 
program began, we have provided almost $30 million to the network above 
the appropriated amount.
    Each year we solicit project ideas from these laboratories and fund 
the most promising ones. Past projects have standardized the 
interoperability of communication between the labs and USDA and 
increased the capacity of the network in detecting disease. The yearly 
funding stream allows the laboratories to help us identify gaps in our 
animal health testing capabilities and innovative and promising 
solutions, strengthening the labs themselves and our overall animal 
health surveillance abilities.
    Additionally, we have funded five NAHLN laboratories to represent 
their regions in providing risk assessment and assay development to 
address potential pathogens threatening animal agriculture. We have 
also set up working groups across laboratories that have enhanced 
collaboration across the network. Some examples:

  <bullet> The NAHLN Methods Technical Working Group, made up of 
        diagnosticians from both NAHLN laboratories and the National 
        Veterinary Services Laboratories reference laboratories, 
        evaluates new technologies to support a response to potential 
        emerging diseases. Methods comparisons help to identify the 
        best tools for surveillance and response for high-consequence 
        animal diseases.

  <bullet> The NAHLN Exercises and Drills Working Group engages NAHLN 
        laboratories, their state government representatives, and 
        industry partners in preparedness exercises at the local level 
        while supporting similar activities at the regional and 
        National level.

    Question 3. New export market opportunities exist all around the 
globe and will play a critical part in the years to come as our export 
markets shift. In your opinion, where are some areas of the world that 
present potential for U.S. agriculture exports, particularly corn and 
pork?
    Answer. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) remains laser-
focused on expanding trade and market opportunities for U.S. food and 
agricultural products and building on significant wins under the Biden-
Harris Administration to break into new markets. Since 2021, we have 
actively engaged with trading partners to reduce tariff and non-tariff 
barriers for more than $21 billion of U.S. agricultural exports.
    USDA is also investing in a variety of initiatives to boost U.S. 
exports to a variety of global markets, with an emphasis on markets 
with large and growing middle-class populations. The $1.2 billion USDA 
investment to implement the Regional Agricultural Promotion Program 
complements other traditional export market development and promotion 
programs to enhance exporters' ability to diversify into new markets 
and increase market share in growth markets.
    USDA is committed to supporting export opportunities for U.S. pork 
exports. USDA works closely with U.S. industry representatives to 
understand and identify key markets with growth and export potential 
for U.S. products. Beyond maintaining traditional markets such as 
Mexico, Canada, Australia, and China, we see opportunity for export 
growth of U.S. pork to countries such as the Dominican Republic, 
Central American countries, and hopefully South Africa and Jamaica once 
barriers can be removed.

    Question 4. Mexico is the number one destination for U.S. corn 
exports, and in fact 47.5% of our total corn exports go to our southern 
neighbor. As you know, Mexico's biotech ban on certain uses of biotech 
corn has already had an impact on U.S. corn exports and it threatens to 
upend market access to our most important customer if Mexico's corn 
decree is fully implemented. We appreciate the work of USTR and USDA in 
launching the dispute settlement process under USMCA. How has USDA been 
coordinating with USTR to ensure that the U.S. position is successful, 
and that the panelists can vividly see that the science is on our side?
    Answer. Addressing this issue through the USMCA dispute resolution 
process is a top priority for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and 
the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR). Under the 
USMCA, we and our partners have jointly agreed to maintain science-
based measures. For decades, our system has ensured that commercialized 
biotech-improved products are as safe as conventional counterparts--and 
it will continue to do so. This USMCA dispute is currently in active 
litigation, and USDA is working very closely with USTR to ensure U.S. 
corn growers have full and fair access to the Mexican market.

    Question 5. What actions has the USDA taken, such as assigning a 
director and others, to support AGARDA?
    Answer. USDA is uniquely poised to lead development of 
transformative technologies, research tools, and products through 
advanced research on long-term and high-risk food and agriculture 
challenges. The science team across USDA has experience, 
infrastructure, and a proven record of innovative accomplishment. As 
climate change fuels a hotter, drier future, we must do more to ensure 
producers have the tools to continue producing the safest and most 
abundant food supply in the world. USDA believes it is critical that we 
support high-risk, high-reward agricultural innovation research that 
can help to address major challenges in agriculture and forestry 
systems at USDA through the AGARDA pilot program. Our vision is to 
construct a scalable organization, pending appropriation from Congress 
in the coming fiscal years.With current funding, we are in a planning 
posture. This has involved engaging with partners and stakeholders, 
listening, and planning a pilot project. Once AGARDA is properly 
resourced, this program can further advance innovation in agriculture.

    Question 6. In 2015 we had a devastating outbreak of HPAI, and here 
we are again entering year 3 of an HPAI outbreak unfortunately breaking 
new records of HPAI cases. What are the proactive steps USDA is taking 
to answer the questions that still remain unanswered about this virus? 
Have you put together a plan that addresses all the concerns that are 
ultimately needed to eliminate this virus?
    Answer. We know a lot about this virus: where it comes from, how it 
spreads, and how to address it. While the outbreak has had a 
devastating impact on producers throughout the country, the good news 
is that we know how to eliminate the virus from commercial facilities 
and our efforts work. In March 2022, we had 51 outbreaks in commercial 
facilities. In February 2024, we had just seven. We know the virus is 
largely transmitted by wild birds. While our epidemiological 
investigation does sometimes identify farm-to-farm spread, the most 
common source of infection is from wild birds. This is why we have so 
heavily stressed biosecurity at these facilities. There are simple 
measures producers can take to harden their biosecurity and to 
dramatically reduce the risk of infection. In the event a farm does 
become infected, we have standardized processes in place to quickly 
eradicate the disease and to get affected farms back into production as 
quickly as possible.
    We know that improvements to biosecurity can be expensive for 
producers to make, so we are making sure producers understand the role 
the Farm Service Agency (FSA) can play. They have resources that may be 
helpful to poultry producers seeking to enhance their biosecurity, 
specifically their structural biosecurity (e.g., physical construction 
and maintenance of coops, pens, poultry houses, farm areas). FSA offers 
direct and guaranteed loans to promote, build, and sustain family 
farms. Among many other uses, these loans can assist poultry producers 
with implementation of biosecurity measures for their operations.

    Question 7. Small and beginning farmers, especially those without 
inherited land have started to feel the pressure of increased interest 
rates. According to the Kansas City Fed, rates were more than a full 
percentage point higher than average rates last year and stayed between 
eight and nine percent. That rate hike can see all margin squeezed away 
even if they are able to access land. Would tax policy set by Congress 
that would reduce interest rates on producers by 1% have a positive 
impact on young, beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers?
    Answer. The Department is willing to engage in conversations with 
the U.S. Department of Treasury, which has the institutional expertise 
in tax policy, and your office to better understand your proposals and 
its potential impacts.

    Question 8. Competition has been a key piece of your agenda. Just 
as producers price shop for seed, fertilizer and other inputs, they 
also shop for credit. Do you think added competition in the 
agricultural lending space would be beneficial to interest rates 
offered to producers?
    Answer. USDA is supportive of policies and practices that encourage 
robust participation in the agricultural lending space. Numerous 
lending options create an environment of healthy competition that leads 
to innovative credit products tailored to the specific needs of an 
individual, an industry, and a community. FSA Farm Loan Programs fill 
an important role in the lending community, with particular emphasis on 
funding opportunities for beginning farmers and historically 
underserved farmers. FSA's direct and guaranteed loan programs support, 
and often work in partnership with, traditional credit resources from 
banking institutions, credit unions, and the Farm Credit System. FSA 
also recognizes the increasingly important role of other non-
traditional lenders, such as insurance companies, farm input suppliers, 
and equipment manufacturers. The many options for prospective borrowers 
to choose from can create an environment where loan costs and interest 
rates are kept as low as possible in many situations. However, FSA 
recognizes there are still regions where lending options are limited. 
In these areas, sometimes referred to as ``credit deserts'', FSA may be 
the only significant agricultural lender. To ensure all producers have 
reliable access to credit regardless of where they farm, the 
Administration has included legislative language in the FY 2025 
President's Budget that would remove a cap on the number of years a 
producer could use FSA direct loan programs.

    Question 9. How does USDA, specifically APHIS, work with other 
countries animal disease traceability agencies to prevent African Swine 
Fever or Foot-and-Mouth Disease from coming into the United States? And 
what can Congress or USDA look to improve upon when it comes to 
ensuring foreign animal diseases do not enter through our ports?
    Answer. APHIS has strong partnerships with our foreign trading 
partners and that is an important part of our ability to keep foreign 
animal diseases out of this country. These relationships are especially 
critical when determining whether and under what conditions imports can 
safely occur. We exchange technical information about the animal health 
status and veterinary infrastructure in these countries that allow us 
to make informed decisions about what to import and what risk 
mitigation measures we need to put in place to allow imports to come in 
safely. In the case of a disease like foot-and-mouth, this may mean the 
responses we get from a trading partner result in an analysis that 
determines there is no safe way to import an animal or animal product.
    The previous farm bill gave APHIS brand new tools to fight foreign 
animal diseases, in particular, the National Animal Disease 
Preparedness and Response Program (NADPRP). NADPRP gives APHIS 
additional resources to work with its partners to expand the reach of 
its animal health programs and to identify and fill in gaps in our 
existing preparedness and response capabilities. Under NADPRP, APHIS 
provides funds to states, universities, industry organizations, Tribal 
partners, and other eligible entities to support projects that help 
prevent and prepare for the most serious animal diseases that threaten 
U.S. livestock, poultry, and related industries. The program has been a 
great success and our state, university, and other partners have 
provided hundreds of project suggestions over the years, far exceeding 
the level of funding available for these projects. In the last two 
NADPRP funding opportunities, APHIS has only been able to fund 57% of 
the project proposals submitted by our partners.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Mary E. Miller, a Representative in 
        Congress from Illinois
    Question 1. During your testimony, you said you have had 
discussions about agriculture and climate change with John Kerry. What 
did you and John Kerry discuss regarding farmers and Climate Change?
    Answer. As part of the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to 
combat climate change, the Department is focused on advancing 
investment in climate-smart agriculture, food systems, and forest 
management.

    Question 2. Have you had any discussions about farming and 
agriculture with John Podesta? What have you and John Podesta discussed 
regarding the agriculture industry?
    Answer. See answer to Bost Question 2.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Brad Finstad, a Representative in Congress 
        from Minnesota
    Question 1. As you are aware, EPA has been taking a novel approach 
to come into compliance with the endangered species act. They have the 
ESA workplan, the Herbicide Strategy, the Vulnerable Species Pilot 
Program. We have heard from several grower groups that since none of 
these actions are considered rulemakings, EPA has not provided 
responses to comments, despite the enormous cost this will mean for 
producers. It would seem that these action bypass peer review and the 
coordinated interagency review process that should normally happen. 
Given that EPA is seemingly cutting out public participation, what 
role, if any, is USDA playing?
    Answer. USDA, through the Office of Pest Management Policy, is 
encouraging EPA to respond in writing to public comments. In addition, 
OPMP will be co-hosting a workshop with EPA to help identify additional 
mitigation measures that are needed so that all growers are able to 
comply with EPA's expectations, as well as identify information and 
data available to support those measures.

    Question 2. Since EPA is applying the mitigations using the FIFRA 
framework, not under the ESA. FIFRA requires EPA to complete cost-
benefit analysis for their actions. Are you aware if EPA is consulting 
with your Chief Economist on what these proposed mitigations--like 
taking land out of production--will cost growers?
    Answer. USDA's OPMP, under the Office of the Chief Economist, has 
provided information to EPA proactively on the expected impacts of 
EPA's proposals to growers, including the potential for financial and 
land use impacts.

    Question 3. Mr. Secretary, I know that you are considering the best 
way to implement the SUSTAINS Act. A number of Minnesota companies, 
including General Mills and others, are very interested in how this law 
will be implemented. Organizations like General Mills have been working 
on sustainability issues for a long time, including providing multiple 
grants to Minnesota organizations to do things like train certified 
crop advisors and provide farmer to farmer soil health education. 
Without clear information on program implementation, companies are 
curious whether their conservation work would be more impactful through 
the SUSTAINS Act or if continued efforts outside of the Department 
would be more impactful. Their insights could be very valuable to USDA 
as you continue to navigate this space.
    Can you please provide an update on what the plan is for 
implementation of the SUSTAINS Act and how do you intend to engage with 
private industry as you make implementation decisions?
    Answer. Over the next several months, USDA will engage stakeholders 
to seek feedback on the best way to leverage the SUSTAINS Act through 
new conservation public-private partnerships. We will be holding 
listening sessions with a range of stakeholders, including private 
industry representatives. The Department wants to understand 
stakeholder interest in leveraging conservation funds through SUSTAINS 
as we aim to develop a program that maximizes benefits for producers 
and conservation outcomes.

    Question 4. Mr. Secretary, as you mentioned before the Committee, 
the states carry out nutrition programs authorized through the farm 
bill. However, as you know, USDA holds final accountability for 
ensuring that benefits reach the intended beneficiaries. In 2022, 
SNAP's error rate was nearly 12 percent. Meanwhile, approximately \1/
20\ of 1 percent of the annual nutrition budget is spent on program 
integrity. It is Congress' expectation that your department works with 
states to ensure taxpayer confidence in these programs is upheld rather 
than passing the blame.
    Mr. Secretary, do you agree that USDA should do more to prioritize 
investments in integrity measures for USDA's nutrition programs?
    Answer. USDA is deeply committed to ensuring program integrity and 
good stewardship of taxpayer dollars. We have taken aggressive action 
to modernize and strengthen SNAP, including protecting the program from 
any threats to its integrity. USDA takes our oversight and monitoring 
role of state SNAP performance seriously. Rather than passing the 
blame, we work collaboratively with states to support, build, and 
maintain high-quality SNAP programs that offer strong customer service 
and program integrity.
    USDA is also working aggressively to help states accelerate their 
progress on reducing payment errors. To be clear, error is not 
synonymous with fraud. Rather, the SNAP Payment Error Rate is a measure 
of how accurately states determine eligibility and benefit amounts. The 
SNAP Quality Control system, which involves both state and Federal case 
reviews to assess payment accuracy, is among the most robust quality 
control systems across Federal programs. In addition to continuing to 
strengthen the SNAP Quality Control System, USDA has doubled down on 
our work with state partners to decrease payment errors by tackling the 
issues at their root cause-including through ongoing engagement with 
states on error analysis and targeting corrective actions.
    Beyond USDA's efforts to work with states to improve payment 
accuracy, USDA has proposed additional investments in Federal oversight 
of retailers to ensure program integrity. We agree that additional 
investments would enhance USDA's efforts to prevent and combat SNAP 
fraud and more robustly support state actions to ensure program 
integrity. In fact, USDA's FY 2024 budget requested much-needed funding 
to do just that, including: a ``strike force'' of retailer 
investigators for improved oversight of the more than 260,000 retailers 
authorized to redeem SNAP benefits and other activities that promote 
retailer integrity efforts; State-of-the-Art Systems for SNAP Retailer 
Management; enhanced system security and data encryption capabilities 
to address evolving cyber-security threats; and other modernization and 
benefit theft fraud prevention efforts.
    Unfortunately, Congress did not fully fund these requests--despite 
the fact that the required funds would not have counted towards the 
discretionary caps. Instead, the specific SNAP line-item that would 
have funded these efforts only received a minimal increase, 
insufficient to meet our program integrity needs and thereby hampering 
our ability to tackle fraud head-on. We have requested these proposals 
again for FY 2025 to support USDA's fight against SNAP fraud in any 
form and welcome your support. These investments would strengthen 
crucial pieces of our robust fraud prevention efforts and help USDA 
fulfill our deep commitment to program integrity and good stewardship 
of taxpayer dollars--a goal we all share.

    Question 4a. What steps has USDA taken, including investments in 
asset verification systems, to ensure bad actors are prevented from 
defrauding the American taxpayer and stealing benefits from the 
intended individuals in need?
    Answer. USDA is committed to combatting SNAP fraud in any form, 
including recipient fraud, retailer fraud, and SNAP benefit theft 
through card skimming, card cloning, or other fraudulent methods. Those 
who defraud SNAP are committing a serious crime that takes advantage of 
low-income families. While the vast majority of SNAP benefits are used 
as intended--to supplement the food budgets of eligible families in 
need--we do not tolerate any fraud in our programs. USDA works closely 
with state and Federal partners, law enforcement, SNAP retailers, EBT 
processors, and other industry experts to protect SNAP benefits and 
combat SNAP fraud. We are continuously innovating to ensure program 
integrity--striving to stay ahead of those who would violate program 
rules and utilizing the latest anti-fraud technology and techniques.
    We work collaboratively with states to support, build, and maintain 
high-quality SNAP programs that offer strong customer service and 
program integrity. While Medicaid requires states to implement Asset 
Verification Systems (AVS) for determining some types of Medicaid 
eligibility, SNAP does not have a similar requirement and instead 
prioritizes using documentary evidence and other data-matching systems. 
SNAP state agencies have some discretion when verifying resources. 
However, all states must verify any resource information that appears 
to be questionable. State agencies use documentary evidence, such as 
bank statements, as the primary source of verification. If documentary 
evidence cannot be obtained or if the verification provided is 
insufficient, the state may require a collateral contact. There are a 
number of challenges associated with AVS that may not make it suitable 
for SNAP-specifically, not all financial institutions participate in 
AVS, and the results are not available in real-time, which may affect 
application timeliness. USDA has instead prioritized targeted fraud 
prevention efforts that more effectively promote program integrity, as 
follows.
    USDA has a robust team of highly-trained data analysts and 
investigators dedicated to preventing and prosecuting retailer fraud 
and trafficking. In our oversight of more than 260,000 participating 
retailers, we constantly strive to deter and root out all types of 
fraud in SNAP. USDA monitors all SNAP retailers in a variety of ways 
including, for example, via undercover investigations and the 
monitoring of transactions for anomalous activity. In FY 2022, USDA 
conducted nearly 9,000 investigations, took action against more than 
4,000 retailers, and permanently disqualified nearly 1,000 retailers.
    USDA also provides significant support to our state partners in 
fulfilling their responsibilities to prevent, detect, and eliminate 
fraud. For example, USDA developed the SNAP Fraud Framework in 2018, a 
toolkit of evidence-based strategies that combines data analytics with 
best practices from industry to empower states to detect and prevent 
fraud. To date, USDA has provided approximately $18.9 million in SNAP 
Fraud Framework Implementation grants to 34 state agencies to support 
their fraud prevention, detection, and investigation efforts. For 
example, Texas developed an automated fraud data analytics model that 
allows investigative staff to identify households that may be engaging 
in SNAP fraud, and Colorado received grant funding to develop a 
database that contains all transaction information from EBT cards to 
inform analytic-driven decision-making. USDA has also undertaken 
several other initiatives over the last decade aimed at supporting 
states in implementing business process reengineering and improving 
client education and data analytics activities to prevent recipient 
fraud.
    Additionally, FNS is taking aggressive action to combat card 
skimming, card cloning, and other methods of stealing SNAP benefits, 
which can be devastating for victims who rely on their benefits to feed 
their families. USDA and our state partners are working quickly to help 
SNAP participants harmed by these crimes, catch the perpetrators 
involved, and prevent future theft, so we can ensure that households in 
need can use their benefits to put food on the table and taxpayer 
dollars are appropriately used. Specifically, USDA is encouraging 
states to enhance card security, including by providing technical 
assistance to any SNAP state agency interested in adopting chip-enabled 
cards, and advancing national standards for higher security SNAP EBT 
cards. USDA is also piloting mobile contactless payments in SNAP in 
five states, which has the potential to help protect families from 
having their SNAP benefits stolen because of card skimming. Notably, 
USDA is using innovative new tools to identify fraud through real-time 
monitoring of SNAP transactions. For example, USDA is piloting an 
application that collects SNAP transaction details in real-time, which 
could help us identify and prevent fraud and EBT card skimming earlier.

    Question 4b. In FY22, USDA awarded grants to 16 states, including 
Minnesota, to evaluate their use of third-party databases to verify 
earned income. Can you provide an update on how USDA's deployment of 
these pilots has strengthened program integrity, including in relation 
to earned income verification?
    Answer. In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Congress 
provided the USDA with funding intended to improve states' ability to 
verify household earnings via third-party income databases for SNAP 
purposes. Using this funding, USDA issued a total of 21 grants to 
states to support these efforts in Fiscal Years 2020 through 2023. As a 
condition of these grants, SNAP state agencies provided qualitative and 
quantitative information to USDA about their experiences using third-
party income databases (TPIDs) to verify earned income. Through this 
effort, USDA gathered information about state processes and procedures 
for accessing and using TPID data and the impacts of TPID access on 
program administration and access. This project helped USDA support 
states in improving wage and salary information verification, 
recognizing that this is a long-standing driver of payment errors, as 
well as procedurally based denials of SNAP applications and delays in 
providing benefits to eligible households. USDA also issued a Request 
for Information (RFI) in May 2022 to obtain information to further 
inform a national strategy for enabling access to TPID data.
    In October 2023, USDA awarded a national contract to Equifax and 
Experian to provide third-party employment and earned income 
verification data services to SNAP state agencies. This contract, known 
as the SNAP Earnings Verification Service (EVS), is an optional, 
nationwide resource working to provide participating state agencies 
with access to third-party databases to verify applicants' and 
participants' employment and earnings. USDA expects that real-time 
access to current earned income information will reduce administrative 
burden and improve customer service while also improving payment 
accuracy. USDA continues to regularly meet with states to answer 
questions and offer technical support.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Mark Alford, a Representative in Congress 
        from Missouri
    Question 1. Agricultural biotechnology is a cornerstone of U.S. 
agriculture, enabling us to produce food and agricultural products with 
less land, less water, and reduced emissions. Unfortunately, APHIS's 
current system of permitting for the interstate, lab-to-lab movement 
for certain engineered microorganisms is burdensome and creates 
significant delays. This stifles innovation. Do you commit to work with 
Congress on a more streamlined, risk-proportionate approach to allow 
for intra-organizational movement of certain engineered microorganisms 
across state lines?
    Answer. We recognize the importance of microbe research to 
industry, academia, and American agriculture. In recent years, APHIS 
has made great strides in modernizing the biotechnology regulatory 
process. The agency continues to commit significant resources to this 
effort while ensuring safety and accountability under the Plant 
Protection Act.
    More recently, APHIS has engaged with industry and academia to 
better understand the challenges they face and additional regulatory 
flexibilities they seek related to working with modified microbes. 
Based on this feedback, in October 2023, APHIS updated its permit guide 
\14\ *** to allow unlimited interstate movement-for up to three years-
of specific microorganisms to all facilities listed on the permit that 
have demonstrated the capacity to safely contain these microbes. APHIS 
also enabled applicants to include multiple species of microorganisms 
in one permit application to reduce administrative burden. In addition, 
in March, APHIS began allowing a new permit flexibility that allows 
developers to include multiple destination locations in biotechnology 
import permits.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In the near future, APHIS looks forward to seeking input from 
stakeholders regarding pathways to commercialize modified microbes by 
publishing a request for information in the Federal Register or hosting 
listening sessions. With this effort, we are focused on eliciting new 
ideas and approaches to better serve companies working with these 
products.

    Question 2. Biobased products play an important role in our 
national security, reliability of our supply chains, and markets for 
agricultural producers. I introduced the Biomanufacturing and Jobs Act 
alongside my colleague Rep. Angie Craig to improve USDA's BioPreferred 
Program and further encourage the purchase and use of biobased 
products. Developing biobased products and processes will also support 
the U.S. in competing against countries with more established 
bioeconomies.
    Can you share your perspective on USDA's role in educating agencies 
on proper procurement, and how USDA's work on biobased products impacts 
our economic and national security while fostering a competitive 
agriculture bioeconomy in the U.S. and globally?
    Answer. The growing bioeconomy has the potential to create 
unprecedented growth in the rural economy and create a higher level of 
self-sufficiency for farming and rural communities. USDA programs 
support development of a more robust rural economy and assist rural 
businesses and cooperatives expand, gain increased access to capital, 
leverage existing market opportunities, and facilitate competitive 
markets. The BioPreferred<SUP>'</SUP> Program supports and encourages 
the purchase of biobased products and has the ability to spur economic 
development, increase jobs, and provide new markets for farm 
commodities. The program provides biobased product manufacturers with 
market opportunities for their biobased products and increases the 
purchase and use of biobased products in the Federal Government. In 
addition to economic impacts, substituting renewable agricultural 
feedstock for petroleum-based products can help us reduce our 
dependence on petroleum as well as increase the potential to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions.
    USDA looks to continue to build the program and ensure its long-
term success and will remain committed to providing leadership, 
direction, integration, and coordination of the biobased program for 
USDA and the Federal Government. We will maintain ongoing efforts to 
develop new training programs for Federal Procurement Officers and 
improve reporting and tracking of biobased product purchases. The 
program intends to expand outreach efforts to make sure we are 
communicating with manufacturers and vendors and disseminating 
information to other agencies who work with manufacturers and vendors. 
We also believe a key to the development and successful implementation 
of an affirmative biobased procurement program is through promotion, 
education, and technical assistance.

    Question 3. The American bioeconomy provides vital opportunities 
for growers in my district and across the country, while also powering 
important investments across the nation in manufacturing. Can you share 
how the USDA BioPreferred program is working to help these important 
growers and manufacturers capture a premium in the market?
    Answer. With the goal of increasing the development, purchase, and 
use of biobased products, USDA's BioPreferred<SUP>'</SUP> Program 
strives to be the Federal Government's official advocate and market 
accelerator for biobased products. The Program's primary goals are to 
spur economic development; create new markets for farm commodities; 
increase the development, purchase, and use of biobased products; 
create new jobs; support people in rural communities; promote 
innovation; and contribute to a growing and thriving bioeconomy. The 
Program requires Federal agencies and contractors to give purchasing 
preference to biobased products. The USDA BioPreferred Program also 
includes a certification and labeling initiative for biobased products 
to be labeled with the USDA Certified Biobased Product Label. More than 
2,400 companies spanning all fifty states participate in the Program. 
From farm and field all the way through the manufacturing process, the 
expanding market for biobased products creates jobs and helps support 
economic growth in rural America.
    The USDA Certified Biobased Product Label helps to create and 
expand markets for biobased products by making them stand out to 
consumers, particularly for those consumers with a desire to purchase 
products that positively impact climate change and promote healthier 
indoor and outdoor environments. The label and other promotions by USDA 
help to establish new markets for biobased products and increase market 
share for these products, helping farmers, manufacturers, and 
investors.

    Question 3a. How many products are currently certified and in the 
pipeline?
    Answer. There are currently 8,400 USDA Certified Biobased Products 
with about 250 applications in the screening and testing stages. 
Products take about 60 days to go through the BioPreferred Program's 
screening, undergo testing, and obtain certification. On average, the 
BioPreferred Program receives approximately 115 new applications each 
month.

    Question 3b. How have those products been treated in the Federal 
procurement space?
    Answer. Products in the BioPreferred<SUP>'</SUP> Program support 
the strategic goal of creating a market for biobased products through 
mandatory government-wide purchasing requirements. The Program's 
central registry and online catalog now includes 139 product categories 
representing over 8,900 biobased products and allows Federal 
contracting and procurement officials to locate and compare products 
that meet the mandatory procurement requirements.
    Federal Service and Construction contractors are required to report 
their biobased product purchases annually. In FY 2023, these 
contractors reported purchases of biobased products from 130 distinct 
categories with a total reported spend of $64 million. Executive Order 
14081, Advancing Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Innovation for a 
Sustainable, Safe, and Secure Bioeconomy, requires additional Federal 
agency reporting to the Office of Management and Budget, The 
BioPreferred Program looks forward to agency purchasing results from 
other procurement vehicles.

    Question 3c. How many USDA BioPreferred products are included in 
Federal procurement catalogues--not just at USDA but across the 
government?
    Answer. Currently, there are approximately 8,285 USDA Certified 
Biobased Products and 8,900 biobased products that qualify for Federal 
purchasing listed in the USDA BioPreferred Program's online catalog.
    Both GSA Advantage! and DoD FedMall offer biobased products in 
their environmental aisles. The BioPreferred Program strongly 
encourages Program participants to obtain a GSA schedule contract to 
take advantage of these markets for their products. Through our website 
and newsletters, we also encourage Federal buyers to make purchases 
through these resources.

    Question 4. The University of Missouri's Agricultural Experiment 
Station performs cutting-edge research over 14,000 acres, and houses 
the Bradford Research Farm, one of the largest concentrations of 
research plots for crops and soils in Missouri. To ensure that 
agricultural innovation developed at our universities support our 
farmers, on-farm trials are essential. Secretary Vilsack, how can NRCS 
programs like the Conservation Innovation Grants under EQIP better 
support the use of innovative research that will increase yields and 
efficiencies, while also reducing emissions?
    Answer. The Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG) program stimulates 
the development, adoption, and evaluation of innovative conservation 
approaches. The CIG program, both Classic and On-Farm Conservation 
Innovation Trials (OFCIT) has a history of projects led by 
universities. OFCIT in particular includes farmer field trials and 
incentive payments to encourage the adoption of innovative conservation 
approaches like the ones described above. In FY 2023 we removed the 
match requirement for OFCIT to make it easier for entities to 
participate in the CIG program.

    Question 5. Mr. Secretary, as you know, the U.S. has long enjoyed a 
trade surplus in agricultural goods. However, in recent years we have 
been losing that advantage. Recent USDA projections have forecasted a 
record trade deficit of $30.5 billion for the fiscal year 2024. 
Enforcing existing trade agreements is crucial to supporting market 
access for our ag producers.
    On that front, I know your department has been working to reopen 
markets to U.S. poultry products in both China and Columbia. For China, 
trade has been blocked from a large number of states due to stated 
concerns about HPAI (Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza) despite the 
fact that there are existing bilateral agreements governing the Hi-Path 
protocols with which the U.S. is compliant. For Columbia, we understand 
that Columbia has stopped issuing import permits for all poultry 
products but have not provided official notification of market closure.
    Could you briefly give us an update on your department's efforts 
and progress towards reopening these markets?
    Answer. USDA has been working diligently to facilitate exports 
globally and continues to press forward to remove as many barriers to 
trade as possible. With regards to Colombia, you are correct that in 
August 2023, Colombia did restrict the import of poultry, egg, and 
genetic products due to HPAI concerns. This was viewed as a deviation 
from the 2012 regionalization agreement under the U.S.-Colombian Trade 
Promotion Agreement. In February of 2024, agreements were reached by 
both the Colombian and U.S. Governments, completely reopening the 10th 
largest market globally for poultry, estimated in value at over $100 
million annually.
    In October and November 2023, the People's Republic of China (PRC) 
updated registration lists for the first time since 2022, including new 
facilities which are preparing to ship ``cooked paws''. There are still 
31 U.S. states that are under HPAI-related restrictions. However, as of 
March 2024, the PRC has not removed state-level HPAI import suspensions 
on multiple states that already meet the criteria for HPAI freedom 
under the 2020 bilateral protocol. The PRC remains the second leading 
market for U.S. poultry exports, despite serious challenges related to 
HPAI-based restrictions. In 2022, U.S. poultry export sales totaled 
nearly $1.1 billion, making PRC the second largest foreign market for 
U.S. poultry and poultry products, following Mexico. To date, APHIS-
Beijing has now submitted HPAI release letters and supporting documents 
for 27 U.S. states that are eligible to export according to the terms 
of the protocol.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Derrick Van Orden, a Represntative in 
        Congress from Wisconsin
    Question 1. Dairy Business Innovation Initiative: Secretary 
Vilsack, dairy is an economic engine for the upper Midwest and provides 
bountiful nutrition for millions of Americans. I'm so glad the U.S. 
House passed the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act in December--we need 
more milk options for schools and children, less chalk water more real 
milk. I am really interested in solving problems and leveraging private 
industry to make investments in dairy. One of the efforts USDA offers 
is the Dairy Business Innovation Initiative. These initiatives convene 
farmers, industry partners, and academia to tackle production, 
processing, and marketing needs of the dairy industry specific to each 
initiative's coverage area. Focused on enhancing the capacity and 
vitality of the dairy industry, the program offers grants to industry 
participants.
    I'd like to know how strong is the demand for the DBI's. Can you 
tell me how many project are funded, how many applications are 
received, how much funding is requested by companies and farmers 
applying, and how are we measuring the effectiveness of each DBI?
    I hear good things about the one in Wisconsin, so I'm interested 
these public-private investments that grow dairy innovation and trade.
    Answer. The Dairy Business Innovation (DBI) Initiatives support 
dairy businesses in the development, production, marketing, and 
distribution of dairy products. DBI Initiatives provide direct 
technical assistance and subawards to dairy businesses, including niche 
dairy products, such as specialty cheese, or dairy products derived 
from the milk of a dairy animal, including cow, sheep, and goat milk.
    In 2023, AMS awarded $23 million in awards to support dairy 
businesses and producers under the DBI program. The funds were awarded 
to the four current DBI Initiatives according to the formula mandated 
in the appropriation: $1.8 million was awarded to the California State 
University Fresno and $7 million each was awarded to the University of 
Tennessee, Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets, and the 
University of Wisconsin. The DBI Initiatives provide technical 
assistance to dairy businesses and use at least 50% of the award 
funding for subawards to dairy businesses. The DBI Initiatives' 
approach of providing both technical assistance and subawards to dairy 
businesses serves as a unique and effective model by facilitating the 
development of critical relationships with local dairy producers and 
processors to support their on-the-ground needs.
    Since 2019, which was the DBI Initiatives' first year of funding, 
the initiatives have funded over 600 subaward projects from over 1,800 
applications received, representing over $64 million in funding to 
support the growth of dairy businesses in the 40 states the DBIs serve. 
Each initiative designs its subaward program to meet the needs 
identified in the region. More information is available in the Dairy 
Business Initiatives Report to Congress here: https://www.ams.usda.gov/
sites/default/files/media/DBIReporttoCongress.pdf.
    AMS works with the initiatives to gather information on the impact 
of the technical assistance the initiatives are providing as well as 
subaward data, including accomplishments, impacts, and success stories. 
Recently, AMS conducted listening sessions with the initiatives to 
standardize the collection of data that aligns with what the 
initiatives are collecting from their subaward recipients. This data 
standardization helps AMS to better understand and quantify program 
impacts. These initiatives are helping diversify the dairy product 
markets and promoting marketing and innovation benefiting work for 
producers in 40 states.

    Question 2. Organic FMMO: I've heard from organic dairy farmers and 
organic milk buyers that the Federal Milk Marketing Orders offer no 
benefit or value for organic milk and have no bearing on day-to-day 
organic milk prices. The most recent FMMO hearings that concluded this 
past month did not review a proposal to exempt organic milk from 
pooling obligations, leaving hundred of organic farmers frustrated and 
disappointed. Is USDA willing to hear a proposal and establish a 
hearing on the role of organic milk in the Federal Milk Marketing 
Orders?
    Answer. The Federal Milk Marketing Order (FMMO) program regulates 
organic and conventional milk identically because the Agricultural 
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended, classifies milk based on 
form and use, not on farm production method. FMMOs require conventional 
and organic milk processors to pay the same classified price for milk 
based on its end use-fluid milk, soft products, or storable products.
    A proposal was submitted to treat organic milk differently within 
the FMMOs during the request for proposals in June 2023, in 
anticipation of the August 2023 hearing. Because the hearing was 
related to pricing formulas, the organic milk proposal was excluded 
from the hearing notice, a decision the Administrative Law Judge 
presiding over the hearing upheld.
    At any time, interested persons can submit a proposal to amend the 
FMMOs in accordance with the regulations at 7 CFR 900.3. All proposals 
should fully address the submission requirements outlined in 7 CFR 
900.22. Once a proposal has been submitted, USDA will consider the 
proposal and determine whether a hearing should be held.

    Question 3. U.S. corn growers are not unique among other U.S. 
agriculture commodities in facing challenges with expanding access in 
export markets. For example, corn exports to our key customers have 
dropped in recent years, and Brazil has claimed market share. As you 
are well aware, once market share has been lost, it is fairly difficult 
to get back. Obviously, I am acutely aware of USTR's primary role in 
negotiating trade agreements or other trade initiatives. However, can 
you share how USDA is working with USTR to underscore the need for a 
proactive approach so that our competitors do not continue to gain 
market share and capture opportunities that would have otherwise been 
ours? Additionally, how is USDA working to resolve SPS and technical 
barriers?
    Answer. Last year, USDA worked with USTR, foreign governments, 
international organizations, and our private sector partners to reduce 
and eliminate trade barriers for U.S. exports, preserving more than 
$6.4 billion in overall U.S. agricultural exports. USDA continues to 
actively work together with USTR to preserve market share. USDA 
continues to raise specific trade concerns for sanitary and 
phytosanitary (SPS) and technical barriers to trade during annual 
committee meetings, as well as through official USG comments to the 
WTO.
    In addition, USDA provides trade capacity building to current and 
emerging trading partners to promote international trade and open 
markets for U.S. agricultural exports--creating predictable and 
transparent trade environments favorable to U.S. agricultural exports. 
USDA oversees projects that help U.S. trading partners understand and 
implement science-based international SPS standards and practices, as 
well as managing projects that address technical barriers to trade and 
trade facilitation. USDA collaborates with domestic and international 
experts to help build the institutional regulatory capacity of our 
trading partners to expand and ensure predictable market access for 
U.S. exporters.

    Question 4. New export market opportunities exist all around the 
globe, and will play a critical part in the years to come as our export 
markets shift. In your opinion, where are some areas of the world that 
present potential for U.S. agriculture exports, particularly corn?
    Answer. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) remains laser-
focused on expanding trade and market opportunities for U.S. food and 
agricultural products and building on significant wins under the Biden-
Harris Administration to break into new markets. Since 2021, we have 
actively engaged with trading partners to reduce tariff and non-tariff 
barriers for more than $21 billion of U.S. agricultural exports.
    USDA is also investing in a variety of initiatives to boost U.S. 
exports to a variety of global markets, with an emphasis on markets 
with large and growing middle-class populations. The $1.2 billion USDA 
investment to implement the Regional Agricultural Promotion Program 
(RAPP) complements other traditional export market development and 
promotion programs to enhance exporters' ability to diversify into new 
markets and increase market share in growth markets.
    When it comes to U.S. pork and pork exports, USDA works closely 
with U.S. industry representatives to understand and identify key 
markets with growth and export potential for U.S. products. Beyond 
maintaining traditional markets such as Mexico, Canada, Australia, and 
China, we see opportunity for export growth of U.S. pork to countries 
such as the Dominican Republic and Central American countries and 
hopefully South Africa and Jamaica once barriers can be removed.
    Similarly, in addition to the goal to maintain market share in our 
traditional beef markets of South Korea, Japan, Mexico, Canada, and 
now, China, we also see opportunity for U.S. beef in markets such as 
Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines, which have burgeoning 
populations and high middle-class growth. We also think Africa presents 
opportunities for U.S. beef.
    With respect to corn and soybean exports, USDA is actively working 
to maintain markets for corn in countries such as Mexico, Japan, and 
China. Soybean exports are also being maintained in China, the EU, and 
Mexico. With USDA's new RAPP specifically targeting Africa, we view 
this as an opportunity to build momentum for U.S. beef, corn, and 
soybean exports to the region.

    Question 5. Mexico is the number one destination for U.S. corn 
exports, and in fact 47.5% of our total corn exports go to our southern 
neighbor. As you know, Mexico's biotech ban on certain uses of biotech 
corn has already had an impact on U.S. corn exports and it threatens to 
upend market access to our most important customer if Mexico's corn 
decree is fully implemented. We appreciate the work of USTR and USDA in 
launching the dispute settlement process under USMCA. How has USDA been 
coordinating with USTR to ensure that the U.S. position is successful, 
and that the panelists can vividly see that the science is on our side?
    Answer. Addressing this issue through the USMCA dispute resolution 
process is a top priority for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
and the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR). Under 
the USMCA, we and our partners have jointly agreed to maintain science-
based regulations to protect human, animal, and plant life and health. 
For decades, our system has ensured that commercialized biotech-
improved products are as safe as conventional counterparts--and it will 
continue to do so. This USMCA dispute is currently in active 
litigation, and USDA is working very closely with USTR to ensure U.S. 
corn growers have full and fair access to the Mexican market.

    Question 6. In the 2022/2023 marketing year, the U.S. exported 1.25 
billion gallons of ethanol, equivalent to 423 million bushels of corn. 
Ethanol imports offer several advantages to foreign customers who are 
seeking fuel options that are less carbon intensive. The U.S. has 
historically exported ethanol into Brazil. However, Brazil applied a 16 
percent tariff on ethanol imports in 2022 that rose to 18 percent last 
month, which has essentially closed off market access for the U.S. How 
is USDA prioritizing market access opportunities for ethanol and 
working to address Brazil's trade action?
    Answer. USDA continues to support U.S. ethanol market access 
opportunities through engagement and programs, such as the Market 
Access Program (MAP), Foreign Market Development (FMD), and USDA's new 
Regional Agricultural Promotion Program (RAPP). USDA actively engages 
our foreign counterparts around the world to resolve both tariff and 
non-tariff trade barriers, including in coordination with the U.S. 
industry to resolve issues they are facing.
    For example, in 2023, FAS tirelessly worked to expand U.S. ethanol 
market access to Japan in the update to their biofuels policy so U.S. 
ethanol can meet 100 percent of the market, an increase from a market 
share of roughly 66 percent. Efforts also included obtaining 
legislative recognition on land use and biodiversity criteria under 
Canada's Clean Fuel Regulation (CFR), maintaining nearly $3 billion of 
U.S. ethanol and biodiesel exports by removing potential trade barriers 
for U.S. participation under the CFR. Establishment of a new blending 
program in Panama, should lead to increased U.S. ethanol exports and 
serve as a global example for new biofuels policies. Vietnam and India 
also lowered their import tariffs on ethanol which will increase price 
competitiveness of U.S. ethanol for increased exports. Additional 
efforts, including in coordination within the U.S. government 
interagency, continue in these and other markets to support increased 
emphasis on U.S. biofuels in a variety of international forums to 
provide further weight to our U.S. biofuels requests.
    USDA continues to actively engage with Brazil, in coordination with 
the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, to address the restrictive 
tariff imposed on U.S. ethanol. This engagement has included 
government-to-government dialogues and meetings. USDA has also actively 
engaged with Brazilian regulators on their low carbon fuel policy, 
RenovaBio, seeking technical corrections that will allow U.S. ethanol 
to be certified under the program. Through these and other engagements, 
and despite exports dropping more than 99 percent to Brazil, 2023 was a 
record year for U.S. ethanol exports, valued at over $3.8 billion, an 
increase of 3 percent from 2022. Volume-wise, U.S. ethanol exports 
amounted to over 5.4 billion liters in 2023, a 9 percent increase from 
nearly 5 billion liters in 2022.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, a Representative in 
        Congress from Oregon
    Question 1. The U.S. is facing skyrocketing labor costs due to the 
Adverse Effect Wage Rate and Prevailing Wage calculations, and some 
Oregon farmers are struggling to keep up. Many of the producers in the 
Pacific Northwest farm specialty crops, which can be very labor 
intensive. Many of these producers have utilized the H-2A program for 
the last several years. However, I have heard from producers that as 
the rates continue to raise year over year, it no longer makes 
financial sense to participate in H-2A and feel backed into a corner. 
As you know, the Department of Labor sets the adverse effect wage rates 
and implemented the March 2023 Final Rule for its new adjustments. 
While I acknowledge that the Farm Workforce Modernization act could 
help address many of our ag labor challenges, we are still at the 
deference of Federal agencies when they make new rules. Mr. Secretary, 
should USDA be consulted or at all involved in future DOL rulemaking 
regarding H-2A or the ag workforce, given the innate understanding of 
agriculture practices?
    Answer. USDA understands the need for a strong labor pool for 
farmers. That's why USDA announced the Farm Labor Stabilization and 
Protection Pilot Program, investing up to $65 million in American 
Rescue Plan funding to support and safeguard the food supply chain.
    With regard to rulemaking, USDA has been engaged on DOL and DHS H-
2A rulemakings and will continue to be so engaged in the future.

    Question 2. Secretary Vilsack, as you know drought continues to be 
a major challenge for irrigation districts and other water users across 
Oregon. Central Oregon has been the epicenter of prolonged drought in 
recent years and would have been more impacted without the investments 
made in irrigation modernization through the P.L. 83-566 program. I 
especially appreciate the time and resources NRCS has dedicated to 
improving water management in the Deschutes Basin but want to stress 
that the urgency to implement additional conservation projects is 
higher than ever with the Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) mandated 
winter releases for the Oregon Spotted Frog getting ready to triple in 
5 years. Unfortunately, shifting and sometimes layered processes and 
requirements, along with staff turnover and increasing demand on the 
program, has resulted in delays in completion of some watershed plans 
and implementation of others. Can you commit to working with me to 
improve the transparency as changes are being made to the P.L. 83-566 
program and informing my office when significant changes to the process 
or requirements are made that will affect the timing of approvals of 
plans or funding?
    Answer. Yes, USDA is committed to working with you to improve the 
transparency as changes are being made to the P.L. 83-566 program, 
otherwise known to many as the Watershed Protection and Flood 
Prevention Operations Program (WFPO), and informing you when 
significant changes to the process are made. I will also note that with 
Oregon and other state's tremendous successes with P.L. 83-566/WFPO and 
the investments made in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we have seen 
a tremendous growth in interest and demand across the country for this 
locally led program to protect and restore watersheds.

    Question 2a. Additionally, can you provide an overview of the 
factors and process involved with deciding whether to outsource 
environmental or watershed planning analysis and documentation rather 
than handling it inhouse?
    Answer. Internal and external factors influence document 
preparation decision-making. Internal factors include organizational 
structure, goals, and funding. External factors include community and 
partner capacity, engagement, and a project sponsor's desire as part of 
a collaborative effort to improve natural resources within their county 
which is a key component to the locally-led planning process.
    As part of locally-led planning efforts, specifically P.L. 83-566 
Watershed Planning, NRCS utilizes partnerships with individuals, 
organizations, communities, and agencies to leverage resources. NRCS 
evaluates its ability to implement multiple programs by assessing 
staffing capacity, which includes different types of personnel. The 
agency draws on in-state personnel, regional and shared resource staff, 
and also leverages contracting and partnership agreements where 
possible to support watershed planning efforts.
Questions Submitted by Hon. David Scott, a Representative in Congress 
        from Georgia
    Question 1. Housing has become increasingly unaffordable for lower- 
and middle-income families, especially for socially disadvantaged 
groups. USDA's Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program was 
designed to help those families own a safe, decent primary residence in 
rural America. Unfortunately, too many families are not able to take 
advantage of this program.
    USDA may have some administrative flexibility to make the Single 
Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program more accessible. USDA's handbook 
lists four compensating factors that can be considered when looking at 
a loan application. HUD, however, allows a lender to consider many more 
compensating factors.
    Will USDA allow lenders to consider factors similar to HUD and how 
quickly can USDA make this adjustment to the handbook?
    Answer. Yes, USDA is in the process of adding two more compensating 
factors to the Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program Handbook, 
also known as the 3555 Handbook. The two compensating factors are like 
some of HUDs, and once added, lenders will be able to consider them 
when underwriting USDA-guaranteed loans. The review/clearance process 
for making changes to the 3555 Handbook takes approximately 3 to 9 
months. We expect the new compensating factors, and a significant 
increase in the front-end ratio (aka PITI ratio), to become effective 
by August 2024.

    Question 2. The income cap of 115% has not kept up with rising 
housing prices. In August 2023, USDA implemented a new income limit 
table for Puerto Rico. New income eligibility limits will allow a one-
to-four-person household with an income of $39,550 or a five-to-eight-
person household with an income $52,200 to apply to our programs across 
all rural areas in Puerto Rico. Does USDA have the authority to 
implement new income limits for all states to allow more people to 
qualify for rural home loans?
    Answer. USDA is restricted to the ``respective levels'' established 
by HUD, 42 USC 1437a(b)(2)(D), which requires consultation between the 
two agencies when establishing the income ceilings for the Direct 
Single-Family Housing (SFH) programs. Each year HUD releases its 1-8 
person household income limits. These income limits are provided to 
Rural Development (the Agency) for its single and multi-family housing 
programs. The Agency then uses the HUD income limits to establish the 
two-tier structure for all SFH programs. Since implementation of the 
two-tiered structure in 2019, access to the Direct SFH programs has 
expanded in most areas, and is well received by our customers, 
partners, and program staff. However, that was not the case for Puerto 
Rico.
    In Puerto Rico, households with income levels just above the 
poverty line continued to be ineligible for Section 502 Direct SFH 
assistance because they exceeded the low-income limit, even with the 
two-tier structure that was established in 2019.
    For example, prior to the August 2023 change, a four-person 
household with two full-time wage earners at the prevailing minimum 
wage ($8.50 per hour) earning $35,360 per year exceeded the highest 1-4 
person low-income limit (San Juan at $28,000), by over $7,000.
    Therefore, the Agency consulted with HUD and recommended a 
different approach for determining the Puerto Rico income limits to 
remove this inequity. The resulting formula is as follows:

  <bullet> 1-4 Person Household Low-Income Limit

    <ctr-circle> The greater of:

      <bullet> HUD's banded incomes for the 1-4 person limit; or

      <bullet> Annual household income for two full-time wage earners 
            at the prevailing 
              minimum wage.

  <bullet> 5-8 Person Household Low-Income Limit

    <ctr-circle> The greater of:

      <bullet> HUD's banded incomes for the 1-4 person limit; or

      <bullet> Annual household income for two full-time wage earners 
            at the prevailing 
              minimum wage, plus 32%.

    Implementation of this approach resulted in significant increases 
for all municipalities in Puerto Rico. It is important to note that 
while this change provides significant increases for Puerto Rico, it is 
still approximately $10,000 less than the lowest income limits for any 
of the Contiguous U.S. States, Alaska, and Hawaii.

    Question 3. Mr. Secretary, you have been very public in suggesting 
that perhaps you could use the CCC (Commodity Credit Corporation) as a 
means to address the growing demand from commodity groups for 
strengthening the farm safety net through an increase in references 
prices, perhaps in a similar way as you used CCC fund to create RAPP 
(Regional Agricultural Promotion Program) as a compliment to the MAP 
(Market Access Program) and FMD (Foreign Market Development) programs.
    Have you confirmed with USDA's Office of General Counsel that the 
CCC Charter Act provides you will sufficient authority to achieve this 
goal?
    Answer. At USDA we are willing to work with Congress to find ways 
to utilize the resources of the Commodity Credit Corporation to address 
concerns Congress has relative to reference prices. As I have said all 
along in order for there to a farm bill, it is necessary for Members of 
the Committee to come together in a bipartisan manner and to be 
creative when it comes to how they can use the resources within the CCC 
at their instruction and direction to be able to provide the relief and 
assistance they're looking for to bolster our safety net.
    The Regional Agricultural Promotion Program (RAPP) and the recent 
assistance on international food aid programs are a demonstration of 
this willingness and a way to address challenges related to trade and 
food insecurity impacting U.S. farmers and the international community. 
I have not indicated that the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act 
could or would be utilized to increase statutory reference prices, 
rather that USDA is available to look at potential programs and review 
the CCC authority. One item of clarity, RAPP is completely separate 
from preexisting farm bill programs.

    Question 3a. Are you envisioning creating something that would 
operate completely separate from the PLC (Price Loss Coverage) and ARC 
(Agriculture Risk Coverage) programs or something that would work in 
tandem with these programs.
    Answer. I would like to be clear that I am offering USDA to work 
with the Agriculture Committees to find ways that the CCC could be 
utilized to address concerns that Congress may have with the safety 
net. Then we can work with General Counsel to understand if the 
authorities can support Congress' needs and solutions.

    Question 3b. Currently, only farmers with base acres can 
participate in the PLC (Price Loss Coverage) and ARC (Agriculture Risk 
Coverage) programs. If you want to use the CCC to help supplement these 
programs, would you tie your assistance to base acres? Do you believe 
it is fair to use CCC funds for a program that only provides assistance 
to growers of a commodity depending whether or not they have base 
acres?
    Answer. I would like to be clear that I am offering USDA to work 
with the Agriculture Committees to find ways that the CCC could be 
utilized to address concerns that Congress may have with the farm bill.

    Question 4. Last October, the Administration put forth its 
supplement appropriations request which included $2.8 billion in 
disaster aid for farmers and livestock producers affected by natural 
disasters in 2023. That was more than 3 months ago. Does the 
Administration still stand by that number; is that sufficient to meet 
the need out in farm country?
    Answer. The updated cost of operating an ERP-type program for 2023 
is $11.15 to $12.28 billion. The new projected ERP gross payments are 
based on RMA's estimated Track 1A outlays which are then extrapolated 
to Track 1B/NAP and Track 2. This updated amount includes $2.17 billion 
to refund all eligible producer premiums and fees.

    Question 5. The last time the Risk Management Agency (RMA) provided 
for an inflation adjustment to the Administrative and Operating (A&O) 
reimbursement cap since 2015. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 
2023 Joint Explanatory Statement included language encouraging RMA to 
provide for an inflation adjustment for A&O reimbursements to account 
for fluctuations in the cost of servicing crop insurance policies. Has 
USDA looked into reinstituting an inflation adjustment to the A&O cap 
administratively? If not, what are the impediments to doing so?
    Answer. Without specifying in law that the A&O cap should be 
adjusted for inflation annually, the A&O reimbursement rates can't be 
changed without a renegotiation of the SRA. They are a financial term 
of the SRA. The report language from the Consolidated Appropriations 
Act of 2023 does not supersede the requirements in section 508(k)(8) of 
the Federal Crop Insurance Act (FCIA; 7 U.S.C. 1508(k)(8)). The Federal 
Crop Insurance Act requires that any renegotiation be done in a manner 
that, to the maximum extent practicable, is budget-neutral with regard 
to A&O payments and underwriting gains. Any future renegotiation would 
focus on ensuring the program is administered in an equitable manner 
while maintaining budget neutrality, as required by law.
    Since it is a financial term, the inflation factors for the 2011-
2015 reinsurance years were negotiated and incorporated in the third 
SRA draft issued on June 10, 2010, and were further detailed in the 
``Future SRA Provisions'' attachment, which can be found on the RMA 
website News Archives (usda.gov). RMA did not unilaterally create or 
implement these factors as they must be part of a renegotiation under 
section 508(k)(8) of the FCIA. Any subsequent communications from RMA 
regarding inflation factors were informational in nature and only 
reported on the prior negotiated factors for 2012-2015.

    Question 6. Given the complementary intramural and extramural 
programs of the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and the National 
Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), along with the data collected 
and research being done at National Agricultural Statistics Service 
(NASS) and the Economic Research Service (ERS), what is the role of the 
Office of the Chief Scientist in guiding and developing AgARDA?
    Answer. As directed by the 2018 Farm Bill, AGARDA shall be a 
component of the Office of the Chief Scientist. Supporting the Chief 
Scientist, the Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) will lead 
implementation of AGARDA. OCS will engage with internal and external 
stakeholders to search for partners at all levels of the organization 
and to inform AGARDA program priorities. OCS will conduct a landscape 
scan, analysis, and report of high-risk/high-reward USG R&D 
organizations to understand best practices to help develop AGARDA 
program infrastructure.

    Question 7. Has AgARDA received sufficient funding to commence a 
pilot project in FY 2024 as outlined in the AgARDA Strategic Framework 
released by USDA? How will the Office of the Chief Scientist utilize 
any additional funding to support cutting edge research through AgARDA?
    Answer. With current limited discretionary funding, we remain in a 
planning posture until provided additional funds to support this 
effort. This has involved engaging with partners and stakeholders, 
listening, and planning a pilot project. The AgARDA Strategic Framework 
released in 2023 outlines the imperative for a new approach to deliver 
disruptive breakthrough discoveries for agriculture and details a 
strategic framework for how the program will be executed when 
appropriated funding is received at the authorized level plus 
contingencies for various other funding levels.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Alma S. Adams, a Representative in Congress 
        from North Carolina
    Question 1. Fully utilizing the historic conservation investments 
in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is a priority for me and many of 
my colleagues. But those funds are at risk of being misused for 
purposes that not only damage the environment, but also harm rural 
communities, threaten public health, and disadvantage small farmers. If 
IRA funds are used to subsidize biogas and waste storage facilities 
that are primarily used by large industrial facilities, that 
incentivizes concentration and consolidation in the livestock industry 
and makes it more difficult for small farmers to compete in the 
marketplace. Moreover, this misuse of funds would perpetuate 
environmental injustice by disproportionately impacting communities of 
color and low-income communities with pollution, health risks, property 
devaluation, and other ill effects. This appears to be out of step with 
the environmental and economic purposes of the IRA and the Biden 
Administration's vision of investing in underserved communities to grow 
the economy from the bottom up.
    How does the Natural Resources Conservation Service's decision to 
include waste storage facilities (313), roofs and covers for biogas 
capture facilities (367), feed management for livestock (592), waste 
separation facilities (632), and anaerobic digesters (366) as Climate-
Smart Agriculture and Forestry (CSAF) Mitigation Activities support 
underserved communities?
    Answer. Manure management is a major source of methane within the 
agriculture sector and is therefore an important opportunity for 
climate change mitigation. When compared to a typical liquid storage 
system or uncovered lagoon, the identified practices eligible for IRA 
funds are expected to provide methane emissions reduction benefits. 
USDA evaluates all practices designated as climate-smart mitigation 
activities using a rigorous science-based, systematic process including 
compelling scientific literature, critical review of the best available 
evidence, and expert knowledge and experience. USDA support for 
improved livestock manure and feed management technologies not only 
benefits farmers, but also provides public benefit by reducing 
emissions from these activities. Livestock manure management practices 
can only be funded through the IRA for specific purposes:

  <bullet> To implement a Composting Facility (Code 317), which can 
        lead to reduced methane emissions from the increased higher 
        temperatures and more aeration during composting.

  <bullet> To implement a Compost-Bedded Pack system, under the 
        practice Waste Storage Facility (Code 313), which can lead to 
        reduced methane emissions resulting from the added carbonaceous 
        bedding material and regular tilling to promote composting.

  <bullet> To install a cover to capture biogas from anaerobic lagoons 
        or liquid storage systems, under the practice Roofs and Covers 
        (Code 367), which can lead to reduced methane emissions as 
        biogas is captured and either flared or used as a natural gas 
        substitute.

  <bullet> To install an Anaerobic Digester (Code 366), which can 
        reduce emissions by capturing biogas and combusting it for 
        energy generation or flaring it.

  <bullet> To install a Waste Separation Facility (Code 632), which 
        removes solids from manure streams to potentially reduce 
        methane generated from the storage lagoon.

    NRCS conducts site-specific environmental evaluations for 
conservation projects. As part of this, NRCS uses an Environmental 
Justice Evaluation Procedure Guide Sheet to assess whether the action 
would have disproportionate and adverse environmental or human health 
effects on low-income, minority, or Tribal populations and whether 
there is a need for additional consultation or community outreach to 
affected and interested parties.

    Question 1a. Are these uses of funds consistent with the goals of 
the IRA and with Biden Administration policies including Executive 
Order 14036: Promoting Competition in the American Economy and 
Executive Order 14096: Revitalizing Our Nation's Commitment to 
Environmental Justice for All?
    Answer. Yes, NRCS conducts site-specific environmental evaluations 
for conservation projects. NRCS uses an Environmental Justice 
Evaluation Procedure Guide Sheet to assess whether the action would 
have disproportionate and adverse environmental or human health effects 
on low-income, minority, or Tribal populations and whether there is a 
need for additional consultation or community outreach to affected and 
interested parties.

    Question 1b. If you determine that these uses of funds are not 
consistent with the goals of the IRA and the President's economic and 
environmental commitments, will you direct NRCS to revise its list of 
eligible conservation practices?
    Answer. Practices are reviewed when any significant changes are 
made to the NRCS conservation practice standard and when significant 
scientific findings published in peer-reviewed scientific literature 
are acquired. If it is determined that a practice is no longer expected 
to provide climate-smart mitigation benefits, it would be removed from 
the list.

    Question 1c. When deciding to include mitigation activities as 
CSAF, how does NRCS consider the impacts of including those practices 
on consolidation, local air and water pollution, and public health 
outcomes?
    Answer. NRCS evaluates the activities to determine if they are 
expected to provide net climate-smart mitigation benefits. Public 
health, environmental justice, water pollution, and many other concerns 
are considered as part of the NRCS conservation planning process.

    Question 2. The Biden Administration has quickly implemented a 
dozen or more programs that are investing in resilient local and 
regional food supply chains. By your Administration's design, these 
investments have reached a diverse range of farmers, processors, and 
distributors that are supplying high quality, locally produced foods to 
food insecure communities across the nation. These investments have 
spurred on-farm investments for small growers to scale to wholesale 
markets for the first time and their products have reached the most 
rural and vulnerable populations that are not easily served by existing 
networks. Investments such as the Meat and Poultry Processing Expansion 
Program, Food Supply Chain Guaranteed Loan Program, and Resilient Food 
Systems Infrastructure Program have and will greatly increase the 
availability of domestic food products. USDA's Commodity Procurement 
Team has led a successful cooperative agreement program utilizing 
Commodity Credit Corporation funds that state agencies have utilized to 
purchase local produce, meat, and dairy for distribution in food 
security networks.
    How is your Administration going to support the market growth for 
this influx of ongoing supply?
    Answer. The Food System Transformation Framework-USDA's more than 
$4 billion commitment to developing a fair, competitive, distributed, 
and resilient food system-is increasing local and regional capacity to 
gather, process, move, and store food within local and regional food 
systems to provide more options for producers to create value-added 
products and sell locally, which will support new economic 
opportunities and job creation in rural communities. While many of the 
programs and initiatives supporting the Food Systems Transformation 
Framework are leveraging one-time funding authority, these programs are 
working together to develop and grow market opportunities for the long 
term.
    The Regional Food Business Centers (RFBCs), for example, are 
partnering with organizations to deliver technical assistance to aid 
diverse small- and mid-sized farms and food businesses to take 
advantage of new market opportunities created by the Local Food 
Purchase Assistance (LFPA) and Local Food for Schools (LFS) programs 
and leverage their new connections and capacity into future contracts. 
The LFPA and LFS programs are creating demand and market pull-through 
for small- and mid-sized producers to scale into. The Organic Market 
Development Grants are helping build the infrastructure the domestic 
organic sector needs to meet current demand as well as developing new 
market opportunities. RFSI allows states to invest funds in supply 
chain coordination to improve connections between producers, 
processors, and markets, and the three AMS Local Agriculture Market 
Programs (LAMP) AMS administers are used to build capacity and develop 
important new market channels.
    Rural Development (RD) provides access to capital and technical 
assistance resources that create new and better market opportunities 
for agricultural producers and the food supply chain. RD programs 
complement and enhance market development programs and activities 
provided by other USDA agencies, such as the Agriculture Marketing 
Service (AMS) and Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). RD is actively 
coordinating with AMS on their new Regional Food Business Centers, for 
instance, that provide `hub' services to local and regional food supply 
chains for whom RD can provide capital in the form of grants and loans 
to help them grow, access new markets, and contribute to a strong and 
resilient food system. Further, we will coordinate with AMS on projects 
supported through their Resilient Food Infrastructure Program, Organic 
Marketing Development Program, and the suite of Local Agriculture 
Marketing Programs (including RD's own Value-Add Producer Grant), to 
make sure investment-ready businesses have access to the capital, 
technical assistance and grants that RD provides.
    Rural Development, through its National Fund Manager, Reinvestment 
Fund, has greatly expanded the Healthy Food Finance Initiative (HFFI), 
which provides access to fresh, healthy foods in underserved 
communities through the development of food retail stores and supply 
chain enterprises. A priority of the program is to support local and 
regional food production and create viable market outlets for the 
growing influx of fresh and healthy agricultural products, in rural and 
urban communities.
    RD's programs provide funding for the critical infrastructure that 
creates the environment in which farm and food businesses can grow and 
thrive. Foundational rural community infrastructure provided by RD, 
such as housing and community facilities, in addition to high-speed 
internet, electric, and transportation infrastructure, and other 
utilities and services, are necessary for a growing and thriving food 
system.
    Centerpiece RD business programs such as the Business & Industry 
Guaranteed Loan program, Intermediary Relending Program, Meat and 
Poultry Intermediary Lending Program, Rural Business Development 
Grants, Rural Cooperative Development Grants, and Value-Added Producer 
Grants are just some of the examples of RD business programs that 
provide capital and services to agriculture food supply chain 
businesses as they scale and grow their markets.

    Question 2a. Are there plans to coordinate these domestic products 
into public institutions and existing commodity procurement channels at 
USDA?
    Answer. USDA is making significant investments in growing 
institutional markets for local and regional producers. Local Food 
Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program (LFPA) uses non-
competitive cooperative agreements to provide up to $900 million of 
American Rescue Plan (ARP) and CCC funding for state, Tribal, and 
territorial governments to purchase foods produced within the state or 
within 400 miles of the delivery destination to help support local, 
regional and underserved producers. Through the Local Food for Schools 
Cooperative Agreement Program (LFS), USDA is also investing up to $200 
million to assist states in food assistance purchases of domestic local 
foods for distribution to schools. LFS will further the success of 
permanent programs like the Patrick Leahy Farm to School Program, which 
provides grants for training and technical assistance, planning, 
purchasing equipment, and other activities to increase local food 
procurement for school meal programs and expand educational agriculture 
and gardening programming.

    Question 3. Historically underserved producers, and particularly 
those who are Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC), have not 
been afforded the same opportunities to access specialized financial 
and technical support that would increase opportunities to access and 
capital that benefit the growth and success of their farm operations. 
USDA launched the Increasing Land, Capital, and Market Access 
(Increasing Land Access) Program to help underserved producers by 
increasing land, capital, and market access. Last year USDA awarded 
approximately $300 million through this program, and while this is a 
step in the right direction, underserved producers still face 
challenges. From discrimination to misinformation, BIPOC producers 
still face barriers in directly accessing financial and technical 
assistance and it is clear further investment in this area is necessary 
for a resilient food system.
    How important is it for Congress to continue to fund this program, 
and others like it, to bridge the gap for BIPOC producers?
    Answer. It is important to continue to offer the Increasing Land 
Access program and programs like it. It provides community leaders with 
an opportunity to creatively solve problems based on their specific 
needs.

    Question 3a. And what else can USDA do to ensure that these 
producers have increased access to USDA programs that should be 
equitably delivered to all producers?
    Answer. USDA has continued to make investments in staffing for 
field offices, training, expanding views on the various types of 
agriculture and knowledge of the practices, culturally and 
linguistically appropriate resources, and grants and agreements 
designed to address the needs of producers can lead to a broader and 
more equitable access. Further, reviewing of policy to ensure there are 
no unintended barriers to participation. Recently, the Equity 
Commission released its final report (link--https://www.usda.gov/
equity-commission/reports),\15\ which contains an important set of 
recommendations for agricultural policy, some of the items are USDA 
administrative changes that we have already begun to implement; 
however, many are statutory recommendations that the Committee should 
consider.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Sharice Davids, a Representative in 
        Congress from Kansas
    Question 1. American farmers have worked hard to respond to the 
immediate challenges of pandemic recovery, supply chain disruptions, 
and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. How is the USDA working to support 
increased production and ultimately, lower retail food prices?
    Answer. USDA has done significant work on a Food System 
Transformation Framework--USDA's more than $4 billion commitment to 
developing a fair, competitive, distributed, and resilient food 
system--is increasing local and regional capacity to gather, process, 
move and store food within local and regional food systems to provide 
more options for producers to create value-added products and sell 
locally, which will support new economic opportunities and job creation 
in rural communities. While many of the programs and initiatives 
supporting the Food Systems Transformation Framework are leveraging 
one-time funding authority, these programs are working together to 
develop and grow market opportunities for the long term.
    The Regional Food Business Centers (RFBCs), for example, are 
partnering with organizations to deliver technical assistance to aid 
diverse small- and mid-sized farms and food businesses to take 
advantage of new market opportunities created by the Local Food 
Purchase Assistance (LFPA) and Local Food for Schools (LFS) programs 
and leverage their new connections and capacity into future contracts. 
The LFPA and LFS programs are creating demand and market pull-through 
for small- and mid-sized producers to scale into. The Organic Market 
Development Grants are helping build the infrastructure the domestic 
organic sector needs to meet current demand as well as developing new 
market opportunities. Resilient Food System Infrastructure program 
allows states to invest funds in supply chain coordination to improve 
connections between producers, processors, and markets, and the three 
AMS Local Agriculture Market Programs (LAMP) AMS administers are used 
to build capacity and develop important new market channels.
    Rural Development (RD) provides access to capital and technical 
assistance resources that create new and better market opportunities 
for agricultural producers and the food supply chain. RD programs 
complement and enhance market development programs and activities 
provided by other USDA agencies, such as the Agriculture Marketing 
Service (AMS) and Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). RD is actively 
coordinating with AMS on their new Regional Food Business Centers, for 
instance, that provide `hub' services to local and regional food supply 
chains for whom RD can provide capital in the form of grants and loans 
to help them grow, access new markets, and contribute to a strong and 
resilient food system. Further, RD coordinates with AMS on projects 
supported through their RFSI Organic Marketing Development Program, and 
the suite of Local Agriculture Marketing Programs (including RD's own 
Value-Add Producer Grant), to make sure investment-ready businesses 
have access to the capital, technical assistance and grants that RD 
provides.
    Rural Development, through its National Fund Manager, Reinvestment 
Fund, has greatly expanded the Healthy Food Finance Initiative (HFFI), 
with funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. HFFI provides access to 
fresh, healthy foods in underserved communities through the development 
of food retail stores and supply chain enterprises. A priority of the 
program is to support local and regional food production, and create 
viable market outlets for the growing influx of fresh and healthy 
agricultural products, in rural and urban communities.
    RD's programs provide funding for the critical infrastructure that 
creates the environment in which farm and food businesses can grow and 
thrive. Foundational rural community infrastructure provided by RD, 
such as housing and community facilities, in addition to high-speed 
internet, electric, and transportation infrastructure, and other 
utilities and services, are necessary for a growing and thriving food 
system.
    Centerpiece RD business programs such as the Business & Industry 
Guaranteed Loan program, Intermediary Relending Program, Meat and 
Poultry Intermediary Lending Program, Rural Business Development 
Grants, Rural Cooperative Development Grants, and Value-Added Producer 
Grants are just some of the examples of RD business programs that 
provide capital and services to agriculture food supply chain 
businesses as they scale and grow their markets.

    Question 2. How is the lack of a multiyear farm bill impacting 
USDA's ability to strengthen agricultural supply chains?
    Answer. Producers and rural businesses do not have a guarantee that 
they will be able to access programs later this year that they need to 
strengthen the supply chain. There is also the uncertainty around what 
investments Congress may make in programs that support efforts to 
create new markets, expand processing, and support new income streams 
for farmers.

    Question 3. I want to recognize the United States Department of 
Agriculture's work to expand investments in conservation and support 
the development of new conservation practices. This work is 
complementary to the work famers and producers have been doing to 
protect their land for years. One example is work being supported by 
General Mills in the Cheney Lake Watershed and Wichita. By helping 
farmers implement new practices, many of their yields and incomes 
improved.
    How do you intend to continue to leverage the work already being 
done by the private sector and incorporate their research and learnings 
into USDA's ongoing efforts?
    Answer. Through our technical and financial assistance programs, 
USDA is leveraging work already being done by the private sector and 
incorporating the latest research and learnings into USDA's ongoing 
efforts.
    One leading example is with our new Partnerships for Climate-Smart 
Commodities, where USDA has instituted a learning network so we can 
synthesize lessons-learned from the various projects. In addition, we 
also seek to leverage private sector input for our working lands 
programs when we seek public input on our conservation practice 
standards in the national Handbook of Conservation Practices. USDA also 
partners with the private section in our Conservation Innovation Grant 
(CIG) program that supports the development of new tools, approaches, 
practices, and technologies to further natural resource conservation on 
private lands. CIG has allowed us to take private-sector research and 
ideas to advance them with on-farm trials to support more widespread 
adoption of innovative approaches, practices and systems on working 
lands.

    Question 4. Pursuant to the United States Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) rulemaking in 2020, to obtain an Animal Welfare Act license, 
commercial dog breeders or dealers must pass a pre-license inspection 
demonstrating compliance with regulations. Applicants are permitted 
three opportunities to pass. I have seen examples of pre-license and 
re-license inspections where when an applicant fails--for example 
because of improper veterinary care, inadequate food and water, or 
unsanitary conditions--the USDA will allow the applicant to correct the 
violations then conduct a follow-up inspection on the spot. 
Stakeholders have raised concerns that applicants are failing pre-
license inspections then passing pre-license inspections in the same 
day. How would you respond to concerns that the implementation of this 
new rulemaking makes it too easy for those who show an inability to 
comply with the regulations to obtain a license?
    Furthermore, what are you doing or what will you do to ensure that 
the USDA's licensing requirements are being enforced more 
appropriately?
    Answer. USDA takes the health and welfare of animals very 
seriously. The licensing rule put in place in 2020 requires all 
facilities to demonstrate full compliance with the Animal Welfare Act 
before USDA can issue or renew their license. Accordingly, there can be 
zero violations or noncompliances during these pre-license inspections.
    In some cases, a noncompliance we identify is easily correctible. 
Examples of this include ensuring food is properly covered or proper 
storage of cleaning supplies. In these cases, where corrective actions 
can be taken quickly, swift re-inspection may be utilized. These pre-
license inspections are not intended to be punitive but to help the 
licensee understand their full range of responsibilities under the Act 
so they may come into full compliance with the Act.
    To ensure licensing requirements are being enforced, licensees are 
subject to random, unannounced inspections. In the case USDA identifies 
and cites violations during these inspections, the licensee is subject 
to reinspection and potential enforcement action under the Act to bring 
the facility into compliance.

    Question 5. In August, the United States Department of Agriculture 
issued a proposed rule to strengthen regulations on the Horse 
Protection Act, as the agency committed to do back in 2010 during an 
Office of Inspector General audit. Concerns have been raised that 
without these revisions, unscrupulous horse trainers continue to 
``sore'' horses, forcing them to perform an unnaturally high-stepping 
gait that wins prizes by inflicting pain on their front legs and 
hooves. The proposed rule draws upon the January 2021 National 
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report and its 
recommendations for reforms. In November 2023, I joined 125 of my 
colleagues in sending a letter (attached) urging you to quickly 
finalize the rule and ensure it is at least as strong as the 2017 final 
rule that USDA withdrew. Can you share an update on the status of this 
long-awaited rule, which has received more than 115,000 supportive 
public comments?
    Answer. We share your concerns about the welfare of these horses 
and the importance of stronger regulations under the Horse Protection 
Act. We are in the process of finalizing this important rule and expect 
action soon. We will share more information with your office when we 
are able to.

  Hon. Thomas ``Tom'' J. Vilsack,
  Secretary,
  U.S. Department of Agriculture,
  Washington, D.C. 20250

  Re: Horse Protection; Amendments to the Horse Protection Regulations 
            [Docket No. APHIS-2022-0004]

    Dear Secretary Vilsack,

    We are writing to express our strong support for the above-
referenced rule proposed on August 21, 2023, and urge the USDA to act 
expeditiously to finalize it. As supporters of the Prevent All Soring 
Tactics Act, H.R. 3090, we are pleased that the proposal includes key 
elements consistent with the PAST Act to strengthen enforcement of the 
Horse Protection Act (HPA), and encourage you to ensure that other 
needed reforms contained in the PAST Act are included in the final 
rule.
    The existing HPA regulations have not been sufficient to put an end 
to the cruel and illegal practice of soring, in which unscrupulous 
trainers deliberately injure the legs and hooves of certain breeds of 
horses by mechanical and chemical means to create an exaggerated, high-
stepping gait known as the ``Big Lick'' that wins ribbons at some horse 
shows. For example, between 2017 and 2022, on average annually, more 
than 40 percent of horses tested by APHIS at competitions tested 
positive for prohibited substances used to sore horses or temporarily 
numb them to mask their pain during inspection. Despite the agency's 
best efforts at enforcement under the current regulations, soring 
remains rampant.
    The USDA committed to rulemaking to abolish the current Designated 
Qualified Person (DQP) licensing system in its 2010 response to an 
audit issued by the USDA Office of Inspector General. Additionally, in 
multiple Federal Register notices, the USDA stated the agency's plans 
to consider banning the pads and chains used as part of the soring 
process. We agree with your conclusion reached in 2016: ``The 
Department believes that 38 [now 45] years has been more than enough 
time for the gaited horse industry to reform its training practices to 
comply with the Act.'' In 2021, the USDA issued a press release that it 
would be pursuing a new proposed rule expeditiously as a top regulatory 
priority, and Congress has repeatedly urged the agency via 
appropriations provisions to move forward with new regulations to end 
horse soring.
    We urge the USDA to ensure that the final rule to improve 
enforcement of the HPA contains three important provisions consistent 
with the PAST Act, which currently has bipartisan support by 218 House 
cosponsors, passed the House by a 304-111 vote in 2022, and has been 
endorsed by hundreds of stakeholder groups and individuals, including 
the American Horse Council and 70 other national and state horse 
groups, the American Veterinary Medical Association, American 
Association of Equine Practitioners, the state veterinary organizations 
of all 50 states, National Sheriffs' Association, Association of 
Prosecuting Attorneys, animal protection groups, and key individuals in 
the walking horse show world. Additionally, in public opinion polls 
conducted in 2020 in Kentucky and Tennessee (the states where soring is 
most prevalent), respondents across all categories--political 
affiliation, gender, age and geographic region of each state--voiced 
resounding support for the PAST Act's reforms (78% in KY and 82% in 
TN). There is a consensus--among all but the scofflaws associated with 
soring who want to continue committing heinous cruelty, cheating to win 
unfair advantage at horse shows, and profiting from it, and their 
handful of defenders--that these key reforms are urgently needed:

  <bullet> Eliminate Industry Self-Policing: Eliminate the industry 
        self-policing system that is based on DQP licensing programs 
        sponsored by Horse Industry Organizations (HIOs) and replace it 
        with USDA-licensed, trained, and assigned independent 
        inspectors who will be monitored by and accountable to the 
        agency for enforcement of the Horse Protection Act. The 
        industry self-policing system has been a failure, rife with 
        conflicts of interest. This was recognized and documented in 
        the USDA Inspector General's 2010 audit of the Horse Protection 
        Program, and replacement of the HIO/DQP model with a system of 
        inspectors licensed and supervised directly by the Department 
        was the first recommendation of that audit. Such a USDA-
        overseen system is consistent with the provisions of the PAST 
        Act, which the Congressional Budget Office reviewed in November 
        2022 and estimated would have an insignificant effect on direct 
        spending. All inspections must be conducted by experienced 
        examiners relying on science and evidence in an unbiased manner 
        overseen by the agency.

  <bullet> Ban Incentives to Sore Walking Horses: Immediately prohibit 
        the use of equipment associated with soring on the specific 
        breeds known to be subjected to soring. The veterinary 
        community and leading horse industry groups have called for an 
        end to the use of ``action devices'' (including chains), 
        ``performance packages'' (also called stacks and pads), 
        weighted shoes, wedges, hoof bands, and other devices that are 
        not used specifically for protective or therapeutic purposes as 
        prescribed by a licensed accredited veterinarian. They have 
        concluded that this equipment plays an integral part in the 
        soring of these breeds and is an incentive to sore the horse. 
        These devices can cause pain and damage to the horse's hoof, 
        exacerbate the pain of chemical irritants applied to the legs, 
        facilitate concealment of other objects that produce pain, and 
        cause the horse's hoof to strike the ground at an abnormal 
        angle and with excessive force. This prohibition should include 
        exemptions for pads and wedges prescribed for therapeutic 
        purposes by licensed accredited veterinarians as described 
        above.

  <bullet> Apply the Rule to Tennessee Walking Horses, Racking Horses, 
        and Spotted Saddle Horses: These three breeds have a documented 
        history of soring and an ongoing problem with soring that 
        justifies prohibiting certain practices, devices, and 
        substances because of how they are used in those three breeds. 
        Spotted Saddle Horses should be included because they too are 
        victims of soring.

    These reforms will not destroy these breeds in the gaited horse 
industry, as you may hear from opponents of the proposed rule, but will 
instead save the industry from imploding because of the bad actors who 
continue to abuse horses at the expense of the breeds' reputation. Only 
approximately 10% of all Tennessee Walking Horses are shown in the Big 
Lick classes for which horses are subjected to soring to compete. While 
this segment of the industry has declined tremendously in recent years 
due to increased public awareness of soring--with plummeting attendance 
at shows, cancellation of corporate and charitable sponsorships, and 
falling sale prices for horses and breeding fees--competition in the 
other classes that involve the rest of the breed is growing. These 
important regulatory changes, consistent with the PAST Act, will allow 
those who are trying to play by the rules to finally be free of the 
stigma that soring brings on the whole industry.
    We commend the USDA for proposing a strong rule and urge you to 
prioritize the finalization and publication of the rule. As the agency 
committed in 2010 to promulgate rules to strengthen enforcement of the 
HPA, regulatory action is long overdue and must be completed as 
expeditiously as possible. Every day that the regulatory reforms needed 
to fulfill the intent of the HPA and bring about an end to soring are 
delayed, thousands of horses are subjected to chronic, abject cruelty. 
We implore you not to allow any further unwarranted delay.
    Thank you for your consideration.
            Sincerely,

Questions Submitted by Hon. Jill N. Tokuda, a Representative in 
        Congress from Hawaii
Rural Healthcare
    Question 1. As a Representative of one of the most rural and remote 
districts in the country, I frequently hear from constituents who are 
concerned by the limited access to basic health care and mental health 
services in their communities. This is why I restarted the 
Congressional Bipartisan Rural Health Caucus, of which many of my 
colleagues on the House Agriculture Committee--including Chairman 
Thomspon--are Members.
    In your testimony, I was pleased to hear about the important 
investments the Biden Administration is making through the USDA to 
ensure that more than 22 million Americans have greater access to 
health care and nutrition.
    In your response to Congressman Bishop's question about steps that 
Congress could take to invest more into rural healthcare, you 
highlighted three key programs: the Community Facilities program, the 
ReConnect program, and the Emergency Rural Health Care Grants program.
    Unfortunately, my home state of Hawai`i has not receive any funding 
from the Emergency Rural Health Care Grants program or ReConnect and 
has also struggled to leverage Community Facilities funding to support 
rural healthcare facilities.
    Has the USDA conducted a review of awardees of these programs and 
where these resources are being directed and for what purposes?
    Answer. USDA continues to evaluate where program dollars are going, 
and is working to ensure that they are going to the communities that 
need them the most. I will ensure that the Rural Development State 
Director for Hawaii examines this issue.

    Question 2. Has the USDA developed any recommendations for changing 
these programs, including as it relates to funding and statutory or 
regulatory barriers? If so, what are those recommendations, and how 
might those help improve participation in and access to these programs?
    Answer. USDA broadband programs are substantially oversubscribed. 
This results in eligible projects not being funded due to resource 
limits. For example, ReConnect Round 4 received nearly three times as 
many applications (258) as awards (89). Funding requests were 2.4 times 
the funds available ($2.9 billion vs. $1.7 billion).

    Question 3. What is the USDA doing to expand stakeholder outreach, 
ensure greater diversity in award administration, and provide 
applicants and grantees with the technical assistance needed to 
leverage these resources and others to help expand access to rural 
health care?
    Answer. USDA conducts numerous outreach webinars to promote and 
assist in applications to its broadband programs.
    General Field Representatives (GFRs) serve as the primary local 
outreach contacts for RUS Telecommunications programs. In FY 2023, GFRs 
participated in a total of 173 virtual and in-person outreach events to 
promote broadband programs. These events included exchanges with 
telecommunications providers, healthcare providers, educational 
institutions, local governments, economic development organizations, 
Members of Congress, regional planning organizations, Tribal entities, 
and other state and Federal agencies.
    In FY 2023, 33 outreach events were held with broadband 
organizations including the Colorado Broadband Office, FL DEO Broadband 
Office, Georgia Municipal Association (Broadband Summit), Missouri 
Office of Broadband Deployment, Ohio Rural Broadband Connectivity 
Event, Tennessee Broadband Accelerate Program, and the Utah Broadband 
Confluence.
    Several events were held with other agencies that fund broadband 
projects such as the National Telecommunications and Information 
Association (NTIA) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
    Outreach events were also held with Members of Congress such as 
Congressman Thompson's Ag Summit, Congresswoman Leger Fernandez's 
Broadband Amplification event, Congressman Kilmer's WA-06 Grants 
Workshop, and Congresswoman Stansbury's Federal Grants Workshop.
    Many outreach events were specific to Tribal communities. These 
include meetings with the Alaska Federation of Natives Annual 
Convention, BTA Overview for Tribal Entities, Calista Native 
Corporation, and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Telecommunications 
Authority.
    Other outreach events included meetings with individual program 
stakeholders, congressional offices, interagency partners, telecom 
associations, and events that were specific to the ReConnect Program.
Indigenous Traditional Ecological Knowledge
    Question 4. The USDA 2022 Equity Action Plan released in commits 
the department to increasing the use of Indigenous Traditional 
Ecological Knowledge (ITEK) into its programs, including by hiring 
additional ITEK experts.
    I am aware that the NRCS already recognizes ITEK in some of its 
programs. Yet Native American Tribes and Native Hawaiian stakeholders 
find it difficult to update and incorporate this ITEK throughout USDA's 
conservation programs.
    Please provide an update on the status of USDA's ITEK hiring 
initiatives. What steps have been taken by USDA to fill ITEK expert and 
other Tribal-related positions and improve such hiring processes?
    Answer. In 2021, the USDA Office of Tribal Relations coordinated 
with the Office of Human Resource Management to issue a department-wide 
memorandum on Recruiting and Hiring Tribal Relations Positions 
Advisory. This memorandum provides guidance on hiring procedures and 
solicitation standards for agency adoption on USDA Tribal-facing 
positions and positions on or near Indian reservations. Multiple USDA 
agencies have utilized these standards in solicitations for Tribal-
related positions at the national and local levels, and USDA agencies 
continue exploring avenues for strengthening hiring of (Tribal) subject 
matter experts.

    Question 5. What steps could this Committee take to ensure that 
Tribes and other indigenous stakeholders can fully use ITEK in USDA 
programs and services, including conservation initiatives?
    Answer. USDA actively works to elevate indigenous knowledge in 
conservation initiatives, and examples of such steps are referenced 
under the White House memorandum on Guidance for Federal Departments 
and Agencies on Indigenous Knowledge.
    USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service provides conservation 
planning and funding assistance through recognized conservation 
practice standards. NRCS recognizes a process for incorporating 
indigenous knowledge in conservation planning through the Indigenous 
Stewardship Methods Evaluation, Conservation Evaluation and Monitoring 
Activity.\16\ Additionally, NRCS now maintains an internal Indigenous 
Practices team to provide internal coordination on the adoption of 
indigenous knowledge in recognized conservation practice standards, 
amidst related considerations. For public transparency and to provide 
maximum accessibility for producers to utilize recognized conservation 
practices, these standards are published online.\17\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Where Tribes have the internal infrastructure to take on the full 
administration of a conservation project, including engineering, that 
Tribe may seek an Alternative Funding Arrangement for either of two 
conservation programs. Such Alternative Funding Arrangements may 
include practices that are outside the scope of recognized conservation 
practice standards; however, these additional administrative 
requirements may be challenging to implement.
    USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) is 
encouraging applicants to include ITEK in their grant proposals when 
appropriate. NIFA recognizes the contributions indigenous communities 
have made to advancing environmental sustainability and responsible 
stewardship of natural resources. A new statement has been added to 
Request for Applications as a strategy to increase applications 
benefitting Tribal nations and remedy imbalances in support for Tribes.
    Finally, the U.S. Forest Service has incorporated ITEK into its 
practices through numerous actions. These include initiating a review 
of current forest land management plans to introduce early engagement 
with Tribes in developing related projects, incorporating indigenous 
knowledge in nearly half of co-stewardship agreements, and updating 
policies to include indigenous knowledge as a component of Best 
Available Scientific Information, leading to an update of regulatory 
definitions within land management planning rules.
    Where Tribes or Tribal representatives provide culturally sensitive 
information to USDA as matter of record, USDA is also required to 
prioritize public transparency and accountability under the Freedom of 
Information Act. This conflicting priority presents challenges to how 
USDA recognizes the Tribal ownership of knowledge, particularly when 
the presentation of this knowledge becomes incorporated into a Federal 
record.
Natural Disasters
    Question 6. Last August, the island of Maui experienced the 
deadliest wildfires in modern U.S. history. In addition to the loss of 
more than 100 people and the destruction of the town of Lahaina, the 
fires razed more than 6,300 acres of agricultural land, with 
agricultural damage estimated at more than $23 million.
    I want to thank the USDA for its response to the fires to date. As 
Lahaina and the greater island of Maui look to rebuild, the USDA will 
continue to be a critical partner. I look forward to continuing to work 
with you and your staff to ensure these communities can take advantage 
of the available resources and expertise at USDA.
    Last October, the Biden Administration put forth a supplemental 
appropriations request, which included $2.8 billion in financial 
assistance for farmers and agricultural producers affected by natural 
disasters in 2023. That was more than 3 months ago.
    Does the USDA have an updated disaster supplemental request for 
calendar year 2023? And if so, what additional financial assistance or 
program flexibilities is USDA seeking since the last request?
    Answer. The updated cost of operating an ERP-type program for 2023 
is $11.15 to $12.28 billion. The new projected ERP gross payments are 
based on RMA's estimated Track 1A outlays which are then extrapolated 
to Track 1B/NAP and Track 2. This updated amount includes $2.17 billion 
to refund all eligible producer premiums and fees.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Nikki Budzinski, a Representative in 
        Congress from Illinois
    Question 1. President Biden's U.S. biotechnology and 
biomanufacturing Executive Order seeks to advance these industries by 
coordinating resources and strategic planning across the Federal 
Government. USDA outlined a Biomanufacturing Strategy in March 2023, 
including a focus growth of sustainable feedstocks and innovation 
through public private-partnerships and research priorities.
    Can you share an update on the Executive Order at USDA?
    Answer. In the coming weeks, USDA expects to release ``Building a 
Resilient Biomass Supply: A Plan to Enable the Bioeconomy in America,'' 
one of the key USDA deliverables under the EO. From our work developing 
this plan, we have found that U.S. biomass supplies are abundant and 
can be well positioned for biobased product manufacturing if 
improvements are made and farmers are provided with incentives to 
produce biomass while reducing risk. We are also recognizing the 
importance of researching and deploying improved biomass crops, taking 
advantage of woody biomass residuals, and further developing markets 
for biobased products such as through USDA's BioPreferred Program.
    USDA also expects to release in the coming weeks a plan developed 
by USDA. EPA and FDA to update, streamline, and clarify their 
regulations and oversight mechanisms for products of biotechnology. We 
are identifying processes and timelines to implement regulatory reform 
as part of a whole-of-government approach to the regulation of 
biotechnology products, especially in modified plants, animals and 
microorganisms, human drugs, biologics, and medical devices.

    Question 1a. How can USDA's biobased product and renewable energy 
efforts encourage innovation in the U.S. and meet the Administration's 
bold goals?
    Answer. The Bold Goals Report delivered in March 2023 under the 
Bioeconomy EO establishes three priority areas for long-term research 
goals for food and agriculture innovation: (1) improve sustainability 
while increasing productivity; (2) increase food nutrition, quality, 
and consumer choice; and (3) protect plants and animals against 
environmental stresses. USDA's efforts in biobased product 
manufacturing and renewable energy contribute directly to the Bold Goal 
of improving sustainability while increasing productivity. Specific 
efforts making this contribution include: developing the next 
generation of biomass feedstocks and cover crops; improving access and 
utilization of woody biomass for biobased products; investing in 
resilient infrastructure capacity for biobased manufacturing; 
supporting new and better markets for biobased products; promoting 
climate-smart practices to enhance productivity and sustainability of 
biomass feedstocks; and providing stakeholder outreach and technical 
assistance to ensure the resilience of biobased supply chains.

    Question 2. Mr. Secretary, as I know you agree, the bioeconomy is a 
top area of growth for our country. It's providing important 
opportunities for growers in my district and across the country--and 
powering important investments across the nation in manufacturing. Can 
you talk to me about how the USDA BioPreferred program is working to 
help these important growers and manufacturers capture a premium in the 
market?
    Answer. With the goal of increasing the development, purchase, and 
use of biobased products, USDA's BioPreferred<SUP>'</SUP> Program 
strives to be the Federal Government's official advocate and market 
accelerator for biobased products. The Program's primary goals are to 
spur economic development; create new markets for farm commodities; 
increase the development, purchase, and use of biobased products; 
create new jobs; support people in rural communities; promote 
innovation; and contribute to a growing and thriving bioeconomy. The 
Program requires Federal agencies and contractors to give purchasing 
preference to biobased products. The USDA BioPreferred Program also 
includes a certification and labeling initiative for biobased products 
to be labeled with the USDA Certified Biobased Product Label. More than 
2,400 companies spanning all fifty states participate in the Program. 
From farm and field all the way through the manufacturing process, the 
expanding market for biobased products creates jobs and helps support 
economic growth in rural America.
    The USDA Certified Biobased Product Label helps to create and 
expand markets for biobased products by making them stand out to 
consumers, particularly for those consumers with a desire to purchase 
products that positively impact climate change and promote healthier 
indoor and outdoor environments. The label and other promotions by USDA 
help to establish new markets for biobased products and increase market 
share for these products, helping farmers, manufacturers, and 
investors.

    Question 2a. How many products are currently certified and in the 
pipeline?
    Answer. There are currently 8,400 USDA Certified Biobased Products 
with about 250 applications in the screening and testing stages. 
Products take about 60 days to go through the BioPreferred Program's 
screening, undergo testing, and obtain certification. On average, the 
BioPreferred Program receives approximately 115 new applications each 
month.

    Question 2b. How have those products been treated in the Federal 
procurement space?
    Answer. Products in the BioPreferred<SUP>'</SUP> Program support 
the strategic goal of creating a market for biobased products through 
mandatory government-wide purchasing requirements. The Program's 
central registry and online catalog now includes 139 product categories 
representing over 8,900 biobased products and allows Federal 
contracting and procurement officials to locate and compare products 
that meet the mandatory procurement requirements. Federal Service and 
Construction contractors are required to report their biobased product 
purchases annually. In FY 2023, these contractors reported purchases of 
biobased products from 130 distinct categories with a total reported 
spend of $64 million. Executive Order 14081, Advancing Biotechnology 
and Biomanufacturing Innovation for a Sustainable, Safe, and Secure 
American Bioeconomy, requires additional Federal agency reporting to 
the Office of Management and Budget.

    Question 2c. How many USDA BioPreferred products are included in 
Federal procurement catalogues--not just at USDA but across the 
government?
    Answer. Currently there are approximately 8,285 USDA Certified 
Biobased Products and 8,900 biobased products that qualify for Federal 
purchasing listed in the USDA BioPreferred Program's online catalog. 
Both GSA Advantage! and DoD FedMall offer biobased products in their 
environmental aisles. The BioPreferred Program strongly encourages 
Program participants to obtain a GSA schedule contract to take 
advantage of these markets for their products. Through our website 
(biopreferred.gov \18\) and newsletters, we encourage Federal buyers to 
make purchases through these resources as well.

    Question 3. Will the Administration meet its deadline of March 1 to 
have the GREET model update completed and will the section 40B SAF tax 
credit be usable by SAF producers on that day?
    Answer. The Biden-Harris Administration plans to issue a 
Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) notice as part of the Investing in 
America agenda. The notice will catalyze innovation in the aviation 
industry, incentivize the production of cleaner, more sustainable 
aviation fuels, and help make the United States a leader in 
decarbonizing the aviation industry. The Treasury Department's Notice 
will provide important clarity around eligibility for the SAF tax 
credit that was established in the Inflation Reduction Act. The SAF tax 
credit incentivizes the production of SAF that achieves a lifecycle GHG 
emissions reduction of at least 50% as compared with petroleum-based 
jet fuel.

    Question 4. Please explain how the GREET model update will continue 
to deliver value to farmers by accurately crediting conservation 
practices and emissions reductions from regenerative farming, climate 
smart agriculture, and carbon capture and storage--all techniques that 
could massively lower carbon emissions, if adopted?
    Answer. As part of this effort, the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) and other Federal Government agencies (EPA, DOT/FAA, and DOE) 
will jointly announce the 40B GREET 2024 model. This model will provide 
another methodology for SAF producers to determine the lifecycle GHG 
emissions rates of their production for the purposes of the SAF tax 
credit. USDA is examining options for encouraging the use of Climate 
Smart Agriculture (CSA) practices for SAF feedstocks more broadly. We 
are taking this path because we want to recognize the climate benefits 
of these CSA practices and encourage their adoption, but also recognize 
there is additional work to do to assess verification mechanisms, 
empirical data, and modeling. Incorporating CSA practices into the 
production of SAF provides multiple benefits. These include lower 
overall GHG emissions associated with SAF production, improved accuracy 
of overall carbon intensity estimation, sustainable production of 
domestically-produced aviation fuel, and increased adoption of farming 
practices that are associated with other environmental benefits, such 
as improved water quality and soil health.

    Question 5. What steps is USDA taking to ensure that the GREET 
modeling update that is underway uses the same rigorous science on 
which the model is based and does not manipulate the model to deliver a 
predetermined outcome, such as excluding ag-based biofuels from 
eligibility for the SAF credit?
    Answer. The modified version of GREET incorporates new data and 
science, including specific new modeling of key feedstocks and 
processes used in aviation fuel and certain categories of indirect 
emissions. It integrates other categories of indirect emissions--such 
as crop production and livestock activity--in addition to land use 
change emissions informed by GTAP-BIO. The modified GREET model also 
integrates key greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies such as 
carbon capture and storage, renewable natural gas, and renewable 
electricity.

    Question 6. I understand that there has been a positive stakeholder 
response to the launch of USDA's Increasing Land, Capital, and Markets 
Access program. I have cosponsored the bipartisan Increasing Land 
Access, Security, and Opportunities Act (S. 2340, H.R. 3955), which 
would continue the work of this USDA program and provide funding to 
community-led land access solutions across the country.
    I know that this program is currently being rolled out and projects 
are beginning to get underway. Can you speak to the efforts that USDA 
has taken to establish this program and the community response?
    Answer. The community response has been extensive, lots of 
creativity and innovation in the agreements we received that will 
really address needs around land, market, and capital access. The 
proposals were excellent, and the need exceeded the funding that was 
available. To evaluate the over 160 projects, an outside panel of 
twenty was convened. They ranked the projects and then 50 were 
selected. The complexity of the program has offered an expansive list 
of actions and activities to help in this space which has resulted in 
extensive research and work to develop guiding principles and policy to 
support recipients. These national, regional, or local projects cover 
the whole country. Projects also work with multiple underserved 
communities. In addition to expanding opportunities for existing 
farmers, this program helps build the next generation of farmers and 
ranchers.

    Question 7. Would tax policy set by Congress that would reduce 
interest rates on producers by 1% have a positive impact on young, 
beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers?
    Answer. The Department is willing to engage in conversations with 
the U.S. Department of Treasury, which has the institutional expertise 
in tax policy, and your office to better understand your proposals and 
its potential impacts.

    Question 8. Competition has been a key piece of your agenda. Just 
as producers price shop for seed, fertilizer and other inputs, they 
also shop for credit. Do you think added competition in the ag lending 
space would be beneficial to interest rates offered to producers?
    Answer. USDA is supportive of policies and practices that encourage 
robust participation in the agricultural lending space. Numerous 
lending options create an environment of healthy competition that leads 
to innovative credit products tailored to the specific needs of an 
individual, an industry, and a community. FSA Farm Loan Programs fill 
an important role in the lending community, with particular emphasis on 
funding opportunities for beginning farmers and historically 
underserved farmers. FSA's direct and guaranteed loan programs support, 
and often work in partnership with, traditional credit resources from 
banking institutions, credit unions, and the Farm Credit system. FSA 
also recognizes the increasingly important role of other non-
traditional lenders, such as insurance companies, farm input suppliers, 
and equipment manufacturers. The many options for prospective borrowers 
to choose from can create an environment where loan costs and interest 
rates are kept as low as possible in many situations. However, FSA 
recognizes there are still regions where lending options are limited. 
In these areas, sometimes referred to as ``credit deserts'', FSA may be 
the only significant agricultural lender. To ensure all producers have 
reliable access to credit regardless of where they farm, the 
Administration has included legislative language in the FY 2025 
President's Budget that would remove a cap on the number of years a 
producer could use FSA direct loan programs.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Jasmine Crockett, a Representative in 
        Congress from Texas
    Question 1. Right now, USAID feeds over 50 million impoverished, 
malnourished individuals around the world each year through the Food 
for Peace program. There have been some suggestions to change the 
administrative structure of Food for Peace that would shift 
responsibility of implementation to USDA. Mr. Secretary, you talked in 
your testimony about the good work you are doing to overcome the 
existing staffing issues at USDA. So I have a couple questions:
    Would you want to take over the administration of the Food for 
Peace program from USDA?
    What would the impact be on staffing need?
    Is USDA prepared to staff up in countries around the world to 
accomplish such an expansion?
    Answer. USDA is not seeking any additional authority or 
responsibility for administration of the Food for Peace Program under 
Title II of the Food for Peace Act. USDA supports USAID's continued 
administration of that program. USAID has the experience, expertise, 
and adequate staffing levels to implement the Food for Peace Program.

    Question 2. Mr. Secretary, thank you for your commitment to 
addressing this global hunger crisis. As you know, the number of food 
insecure people has more than doubled in the past 4 years due to COVID-
19, supply chain disruptions, extreme weather events, and increasing 
geopolitical conflicts. And American agriculture stands ready to assist 
those in need. That's why I was pleased to see USDA announce $1 billion 
through the Commodity Credit Corporation to purchase U.S. grown 
commodities to support those most in need. I was surprised to hear, 
however, that Ready to Use Therapeutic Foods (RUTF) is not eligible for 
procurement through this funding. RUTF is a lifesaving, and cost-
effective treatment given to children suffering from the most serious 
form of malnutrition, known as ``wasting''. It's made from U.S. grown 
peanuts, milk, soy and sugar and sourced from 28 states. Will you 
commit to review and reconsider the authorities you are using under the 
Charter Act--specifically by leveraging authorities under Section 
5(c)--and to provide flexibility in the list of commodities deemed 
eligible under the program?
    Answer. The $1 billion international food aid program relies on the 
authority of section 5(d) of the CCC Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714c(d)) 
for the purchase and removal of surplus commodities. RUTF is not 
designated a surplus commodity, although some of its ingredients may be 
in surplus. This authority was selected because of the flexibilities it 
affords to USDA, such as coordinating with USAID to address the widest 
variety of global food security needs, as well as its responsiveness to 
domestic commodity surpluses.
    While RUTF is not utilized in USDA's international food assistance 
programs, it is a critical tool in USAID's humanitarian nutrition 
programs. USAID has increased its support for wasting treatment 
programs, and procurement of RUTF, in recent years, and building on 
this experience has developed a multi-year strategic approach to 
continue this support.

    Question 3. Mr. Secretary, can you provide the rationale of USDA 
for prohibiting certain retailers, such as vending operators and micro 
markets, that meet all current stocking and other criteria despite 
there being no statutory restriction?
    Answer. USDA values its partnership with more than 260,000 U.S. 
retailers authorized to accept Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program (SNAP) benefits. The diversity of SNAP retailers ensures that 
program participants have a variety of shopping options, catering to 
different preferences and needs. A retailer must meet several criteria 
to be authorized for SNAP, including meeting minimum stocking 
requirements for staple food items including cereals, fruit, 
vegetables, meat, and dairy. Additionally, SNAP-authorized retailers 
must be able to continuously meet SNAP payment performance functions 
like providing detailed receipts and allowing refunds and product 
returns for SNAP transactions. Additionally, there are integrity 
requirements for authorized retailers that include ensuring that only 
eligible SNAP foods are purchased using SNAP benefits and monitoring 
locations to prevent SNAP violations. USDA considers all retailer 
applications against our requirements and does not have any policies 
explicitly prohibiting vending operators and micro markets.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Chellie Pingree, a Representative in 
        Congress from Maine
Inflation Reduction Act Forestry Funding
    Question 1. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provided $450 Million 
to incentivize forest landowners to access voluntary carbon markets, 
and the United States Forest Service has begun accepting applications 
for a portion of this funding. Can you provide an update on where you 
are with implementing the remaining provisions? Particularly how you're 
working through partnerships with state agencies, nonprofit 
organizations, local governments, Tribes, and universities?
    Answer. The IRA, specifically Subtitle D, Sec. 23002, Competitive 
Grants for Non-Federal Forest Landowners, expanded the Forest Service's 
ability to support innovative projects that engage non-industrial, 
private forest landowners, including underserved landowners, in 
emerging private markets for forest resilience and climate mitigation. 
The IRA also established an initiative to provide payments to 
landowners to implement voluntary practices that enhance forest 
resilience and mitigate climate change.
    The Forest Service has created a series of competitive funding 
opportunities to implement this authority, which were launched in 2023 
and will continue to have sign-ups for their funding opportunities 
later this year in 2024. The agency is funding a variety of projects in 
different types of locations with different types of recipients. 
Applicant eligibility is governed by statute, as discussed below.

    IRA Sections 23002(a)(2) and 23002(a)(3)

    The Forest Service has provided funding to enhance small landowner 
participation in emerging carbon markets in several ways, consistent 
with the foregoing authority.

  <bullet> Grant Funding for Small Landowner Participation in Emerging 
        Carbon Markets. The Forest Service announced its first funding 
        opportunity in August 2023; eligible applicants included 
        states, Tribes, local governmental entities, universities, and 
        nonprofit and for-profit entities. The agency received 76 
        proposals for funding totaling $528 million. In March 2024, the 
        Forest Service announced it had accepted proposals totaling 
        $116 million in grants supporting 20 projects that engage 
        underserved landowners and small-acreage forest landowners in 
        emerging carbon markets. Participating in these emerging carbon 
        markets will unlock private capital for forest landowners and 
        result in more resilient forests. Funded projects benefit 
        forests in 37 states and Puerto Rico. A total of $34 million in 
        grant funding is available; the final deadline for proposals 
        under $2 million is August 21, 2024.

  <bullet> Investments in Technical Assistance through State and 
        Territorial Forestry Agencies. The Forest Service allocated $29 
        million to state and territorial forestry agencies to enhance 
        technical assistance for underserved forest landowners. State 
        forestry agencies deploy over 3,000 foresters to educate and 
        serve more than 500,000 private forest landowners per year. 
        These certified foresters help these landowners establish 
        management plans to guide reforestation and other land 
        management activities and address threats to forest resilience 
        from natural disasters, pests, and disease. States and 
        territories maintain partnerships with conservation districts, 
        nonprofit entities, institutions, and extension agencies to 
        deliver forestry education, technical assistance, and 
        professional advice to underserved forest landowners. This 
        targeted outreach helps underserved forest landowners navigate 
        emerging carbon market opportunities, establish land management 
        plans, and implement practices to improve forest resilience 
        while meeting landowner objectives.

  <bullet> Grant Funding for Tribal Participation in Emerging Carbon 
        Markets. In February 2024, the agency announced a $20 million 
        funding opportunity for federally recognized Tribes and Alaska 
        Native corporations and villages to participate in emerging 
        carbon markets for climate mitigation and forest resilience. 
        The application deadline for this opportunity is August 21, 
        2024. The Forest Service is providing targeted technical 
        assistance--both directly and through partnerships with the 
        National Indian Carbon Coalition and First Nations Development 
        Institute--to Tribes and Alaska Native corporations and 
        villages considering this funding opportunity.

    IRA Sections 23002(a)(1) and IRA 23002(a)(4)

    This authority created new opportunities for the Forest Service to 
provide funding to landowners to implement forest resilience and 
climate mitigation practices. This summer, the Forest Service will 
announce funding opportunities for the following cost-share and payment 
programs:

  <bullet> Provision 1 (Climate Resilience/Mitigation Cost-Share 
        Programs). State and territorial forestry agencies will be 
        eligible to apply for competitive grants to administer programs 
        to issue cost-share payments to forest landowners for practices 
        that enhance forest resilience and mitigate climate change.

  <bullet> Provision 4 (Carbon Sequestration/Storage Payment Programs). 
        Expanded eligibility will allow nonprofit applicants as well as 
        states and territories to apply for competitive grants to 
        administer programs to issue payments to forest landowners to 
        sequester and store carbon.

    The Forest Service has developed an implementation strategy for 
these initiatives that engages a diversity of partners. The agency 
anticipates a robust response from state and territorial forestry 
agencies to the upcoming announcements of these two funding 
opportunities. States will be encouraged to collaborate with partners 
such as conservation nonprofit entities and underserved landowner 
organizations to design and implement successful state cost-share 
programs, and nonprofit applicants will be encouraged to coordinate 
with states and leverage partnerships to provide quality customer 
service to landowners.
Fresh Produce Access through USDA Procurement Programs
    Question 2. What is the Department doing to bolster access and 
improve the variety of fruits and vegetables offered through Federal 
procurement programs. Are there any legislative or regulatory barriers 
to address to strengthen the fruit and vegetable procurement process?
    Answer. Over the course of the Biden-Harris Administration USDA has 
seeking out resource enhancements to simplify and streamline access to 
contracting information for businesses interested in selling their 
products and services to USDA. Few on this Committee may know that USDA 
purchasing actually extends well beyond agricultural commodities. Last 
fiscal year, in FY 2023, the Department awarded contracts to nearly 
12,000 businesses from a wide range of industries for $4.9 billion in 
food, $4.2 billion in services, $1.7 billion in Information Technology 
contracts, a half a billion in goods, and nearly a half billion in 
construction contracts.
    With respect to our work to strengthen the fruit and vegetable 
procurement process, our new Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative 
Agreement Program (LFPA) is using non-competitive cooperative 
agreements to provide up to $900 million of ARP and CCC funding for 
state, Tribal and territorial governments to purchase foods produced 
within the state or within 400 miles of the delivery destination to 
help support local, regional and underserved producers. This work is 
helping to maintain and improve food and agricultural supply chain 
resiliency, and ensuring that we are going to procure and distribute 
local and regional foods and beverages that are healthy, nutritious, 
unique to their geographic areas, and that meet the needs of the 
population. The Department would be glad to further engage with you and 
your office to discuss some barriers we have experienced in the 
procurement process for fruits and vegetables.
Testing for Water Contaminants Rural Communities
    Question 3. As you may know, Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances 
(PFAS) contamination in drinking water is a national issue. Rural 
communities have historically been overlooked by Federal investments 
when it comes to addressing drinking water challenges, especially those 
who are dependent on private wells. What specific programs does USDA 
have in place that can directly help rural homeowners who rely 
exclusively on private wells to test for and mitigate harmful 
contaminants like PFAS?
    Answer. Through USDA RD Single Family Housing Repair Loans and 
Grants (also known as the Section 504 Loan and Grant Program), very 
low-income homeowners in rural areas who are unable to finance 
necessary repairs through other sources may obtain direct loans or 
grants to repair, improve, or modernize homes, or to remove health and 
safety hazards. Testing for PFAS may be considered part of the need to 
assess repairs and would be an eligible expense.
    Also, through the Rural Home Loans (502 Direct Loan Program), loan 
funds can be used to help low-income people or households build, 
repair, renovate, or relocate a home, or to purchase and prepare sites, 
including providing water and waste treatment equipment. Again, testing 
for PFAS may be considered as part of the need to assess repairs and 
would be an eligible expense.
    RD's Water and Environmental Programs do not have a program that 
can assist with private well testing. Currently, our Decentralized 
Water Systems Grant Program provides grants to nonprofits that in turn 
provide loans and grants for decentralized water and waste services 
such as testing and well replacement.
    Additionally, water utilities can seek financing through the Water 
and Waste Direct program to extend centralized water services to 
homeowners whose wells have been impacted by PFAS.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Salud O. Carbajal, a Representative in 
        Congress from California
    Question 1. Congress appropriated $1.3 million through USDA for the 
National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine to assess 
research on alcohol consumption and health outcomes that were not 
addressed in the 2020 Dietary Guidelines. Please explain why USDA 
supports two separate work streams to serve the same purpose in 
developing recommendations specific to alcohol consumption--one by the 
National Academies and a second by the SAMHSA-led interagency working 
group.
    Answer. In early 2022, the Interagency Coordinating Committee on 
the Prevention of Underage Drinking (ICCPUD), asked the Substance Abuse 
and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), as the convener of 
the ICCPUD, to initiate work on alcohol consumption and health as part 
of a broader scientific review and annual ICCPUD report. SAMHSA is 
responsible for providing administrative and operational support for 
ICCPUD under authority delegated by HHS. As ICCPUD's work was getting 
under way, Congress mandated USDA to enter into a contract with NASEM 
to review evidence on alcoholic beverages and health, per the 2023 
Consolidated Appropriations Act.
    While both the NASEM and ICCPUD studies will address the 
relationship between alcoholic beverages and health, there are key 
distinctions between the two, including the types of outcomes being 
examined and the methods being used to conduct the studies.
    Specifically, the NASEM study will use systematic reviews to 
examine evidence on the relationship between alcohol consumption and 
health outcomes, while the ICCPUD study uses modeling to estimate 
risks. Thus, these two studies will provide complementary evidence to 
inform HHS and USDA as the Departments develop the next edition of the 
Dietary Guidelines. Importantly, neither the NASEM or ICCPUD studies 
will provide recommendations on alcohol consumption.
    Both projects will include opportunities for public participation 
and external scientific peer review and will be complete by the end of 
December 2024. The table below provides a comparison of the two 
studies.

    Question 2. Please explain USDA's role in overseeing and evaluating 
alcohol recommendations developed by the SAMHSA-led working group.
    Answer. USDA and our Dietary Guidelines partners at HHS serve in a 
liaison role, where we provide information, as needed, as subject 
matter experts on the Departments' needs for our development of the 
next edition of Dietary Guidelines. USDA and HHS will consider the 
findings from ICCPUD's Alcohol Intake and Health study,, along with the 
NASEM findings, when developing recommendations related to alcohol for 
the 2025-30 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

          Note: Since the hearing on February 14, 2024, ICCPUD has 
        continued to make progress on its Alcohol Intake and Health 
        Study. Specifically, ICCPUD has solicited public feedback on 
        the study's scientific methodology in the Federal Register and 
        held a public annual stakeholder meeting to provide an update 
        on the study and provide an opportunity for public feedback. 
        Importantly, neither the ICCPUD study nor the NASEM study will 
        provide recommendations on adult alcohol consumption. Rather, 
        ICCPUD and NASEM each will provide a report with findings to 
        HHS and USDA for consideration as the Departments develop the 
        next edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

    Question 3. Will USDA actively review and assess recommendations 
developed by the SAMHSA-led interagency working group and how will USDA 
work with HHS to ensure that any recommendations are developed free of 
conflicts of interest?
    Answer. USDA notes that following the hearing on February 14, 2024, 
ICCPUD has continued to make progress on its Alcohol Intake and Health 
Study. Specifically, ICCPUD has solicited public feedback on the 
study's scientific methodology in the Federal Register and held a 
public annual stakeholder meeting to provide an update on the study and 
provide an opportunity for public feedback. Importantly, neither the 
ICCPUD study nor the NASEM study will provide recommendations on adult 
alcohol consumption. Rather, ICCPUD and NASEM each will provide a 
report with findings to HHS and USDA for consideration as the 
Departments develop the next edition of the Dietary Guidelines for 
Americans.

    Question 4. Federal law requires that the preponderance of 
scientific and medical knowledge must support changes to the existing 
Dietary Guidelines recommendations. No changes can be made without 
clearly showing that the preponderance of scientific and medical 
knowledge supports each change. How is the SAMHSA-led technical 
committee ensuring that this mandate by Congress is followed as it 
reviews research and drafts recommendations?
    Answer. The Alcohol Intake and Health studies will be completed by 
experts with experience conducting meta-analyses, relative risk 
estimates, and systematic reviews related to alcohol intake and health. 
The studies will assess the current, best, and most applicable 
scientific evidence on the relationship between consumption of alcohol 
and health outcomes using methodological approaches that are grounded 
in rigorous scientific evidence and follow best practices. More 
information about the methods and study protocols are available on 
ICCPUD's website.\19\ Additionally, the methods and findings from the 
review of the evidence on alcohol intake and health will undergo a 
rigorous review process, including scientific external peer review and 
opportunities for public comment. HHS and USDA will ensure that the 
Dietary Guidelines recommendations will be based on the preponderance 
of scientific and medical knowledge.

Health-Methodology-for-Public-Comment.pdf.

    Question 5. How is USDA ensuring that the scientific review process 
underway by the SAMHSA-led working group mirrors the Dietary Guidelines 
Advisory Committee process in its research procedures and protocols, 
commitment to transparency, preclusion of conflicts of interest and 
willingness to invite comment from interested public stakeholders?
    Answer. To ensure transparency and opportunity for public comment, 
ICCPUD has created multiple opportunities for public comment on the 
Alcohol Intake and Health Study, as well as a public meeting with 
interested stakeholders as part of the annual ICCPUD Stakeholders 
meeting. First, ICCPUD solicited public comments during the summer of 
2024 on the scientific methodology and study protocols of the Alcohol 
Intake and Health Study. This request for comment was posted to the 
public docket OASH maintains on the Dietary Guidelines. Second, there 
will be an opportunity in late 2024 for public comment on the draft 
study outcomes. In addition, on August 7, 2024, the ICCPUD convened its 
annual stakeholders meeting which was open to the public. During this 
meeting, ICCPUD members provided updates on the Alcohol Intake and 
Health Study. It is also worth noting that information is updated on 
the ICCPUD website to ensure transparency throughout the process. The 
findings will also undergo a rigorous external review process that will 
include scientific peer review and opportunities for public comment.
    Further, all Technical Review Subcommittee members and external 
subject matter experts involved in the Alcohol Intake and Health Study 
are required to declare sources of funding (direct or indirect) and any 
connection (direct or indirect) with the tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, or 
pharmaceutical industries, including any connection (direct or 
indirect) with any entity that is substantially funded by one of these 
organizations. This process is included in the 2023 ICCPUD 
Comprehensive Plan. Biographies and financial disclosures for the 
members of the Scientific Review Panel are available on ICCPUD's 
website.

    Question 6. Will the work of the National Academies and 
recommendations developed by the SAMHSA-led interagency group be 
considered for inclusion in the 2025 Dietary Guidelines? If not, please 
explain how any alcohol policies will be reported to consumers, the 
medical community and interested stakeholders.
    Answer. The NASEM study pre-publication report is expected December 
2024. The ICCPUD Technical Review Subcommittee findings will be 
published as part of the ICCPUD's 2025 Report to Congress on the 
Prevention and Reduction of Underage Drinking as required by Congress. 
This timeline will allow for both projects to be considered in the 
development of guidance on alcoholic beverages and health to be 
included in the next edition of the Dietary Guidelines.

    Question 7. Will alcohol policies and recommendations remain part 
of future Dietary Guidelines or will they be part of a separate process 
and which agency will lead that effort?
    Answer. USDA and HHS have not made plans to exclude alcohol 
consumption and health from future editions of the Dietary Guidelines 
for Americans.
