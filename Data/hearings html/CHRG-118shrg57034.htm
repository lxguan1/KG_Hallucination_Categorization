                       WEDNESDAY, APRIL 10, 2024

                                       U.S. Senate,
                            Committee on Foreign Relations,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in room 
SD-419, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Benjamin L. 
Cardin, chairman of the committee, presiding.
    Present: Senators Cardin [presiding], Menendez, Shaheen, 
Kaine, Booker, Van Hollen, Duckworth, Risch, Romney, Ricketts, 
Paul, and Cruz.

         OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BENJAMIN L. CARDIN, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MARYLAND

    The Chairman. The hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee will come to order.
    Our hearing today is for the United States Agency for 
International Development budget request for fiscal year 2025. 
We welcome the Honorable Samantha Power with us today.
    The director is doing an incredible job with all the 
challenges we have around the world so we thank you very much 
for your public service.
    From the civil war in Sudan to terror attacks and coups in 
western Africa and the Sahel region to the famine in Gaza to 
the humanitarian crisis in Haiti, there are more and more 
challenges in the world today.
    [Disturbance in the hearing room.]
    The Chairman. There will be no outbreaks. You will be asked 
to leave. I am going to have to ask you to leave. I have to ask 
you to leave.
    And yet despite the best efforts of our colleagues on the 
Appropriations Committee--I know that we have Senator Shaheen 
here with Senator Coons, who chairs the subcommittee--the 
foreign assistance budget for this year enacted 6 months into 
the year declined by 5 percent and some parts of USAID budgets 
by as much as 10 percent. The result is that when we try to 
address one crisis we often have to use money from somewhere 
else.
    We should not have to choose between addressing the climate 
crisis or helping vulnerable communities adapt to our rapidly 
changing world, or housing refugees fleeing violence, or 
funding anti-corruption programs, or strengthening our global 
health initiatives. We need to expand the pie.
    Administrator Power, I know you deal with these daunting 
challenges every day at USAID. I appreciate your leadership, 
and thank you for appearing before us today.
    I recognize that you and your team work in some of the 
toughest and dangerous places in the world by supporting 
economic development in the Pacific Island nations to Latin 
America, USAID is pushing back against China's growing 
influence.
    By helping Ukraine with direct budget support you are 
keeping the government open while it fights back against 
Putin's brutal attacks. Our nation's generosity is a stark 
contrast to programs like China's Belt and Road Initiative.
    The United States international development strategy is 
about supporting the aspirations of millions of average 
citizens around the world. It is about promoting prosperity, 
independence, and peace, as opposed to the debt trap diplomacy 
Beijing uses to exert tremendous influence to weaken democracy, 
foment corruption, and assert control over decisionmaking in 
sovereign nations.
    This is why the success of USAID is so central to the 
United States' national security interests, because the more 
free and thriving democratic nations that exist in the world 
the safer and more prosperous we will be at home.
    I think good governance and anti-corruption efforts must be 
at the heart of USAID's mission on the ground, and I hope you 
will give us an update in this regard. I also look forward to 
hearing about the progress USAID is making in putting local 
communities in the lead of delivering programs as you pledged 
to do 2 years ago, and we had a pretty healthy discussion about 
that during your testimony at that time.
    Localizing our assistance is critical to building 
sufficiency and getting the most bang for our buck. I also want 
your assessment of USAID's humanitarian relief around the 
world. Sudan faces a famine. I know Senator Booker was just 
recently in Sudan and reported to some of us the circumstances 
he saw, which are extremely dire.
    Haiti is a challenging environment, although the World Food 
Programme supported by Food for Peace has an enormous warehouse 
in Port-au-Prince with grain stacked to the ceiling, and yet we 
have a crisis in Haiti.
    We need to get to people before they go hungry. Even as we 
respond to the world crisis and natural disasters we also need 
to plan for the long term--energy security, infrastructure, 
water and sanitation, improving opportunity for women and 
girls, democracy and good governance assistance.
    Many of these issues USAID handles will boomerang back at 
us in the future if we do not make real progress on addressing 
these challenges today. Your work is critically important to 
the United States' national security interests.
    So, Administrator Power, we have a lot to cover, and I look 
forward to your testimony.
    At this time I will recognize my distinguished ranking 
member, Senator Risch.

               STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES E. RISCH, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM IDAHO

    Senator Risch. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and 
Administrator Power, thank you for being here today, and let me 
say before I launch into my in depth criticisms I fully 
appreciate the position you are in.
    You have got one of the toughest jobs in the 
Administration. There is never enough money for anything that 
we do. But this is really tough, and particularly when you are 
making choices that are life and death choices. We understand 
that, and believe me, the criticisms I have here are meant to 
move us forward as opposed to backward. So thank you for that.
    In theory, we are here today to discuss a budget for fiscal 
year 2025. Unfortunately, Congress only passed a budget for 
fiscal year 2024 19 days ago and are still debating the 
supplemental budget request that was submitted 8 months ago.
    Meanwhile, Putin's war machine has been hammering Ukraine 
for more than 2 years. Hamas has been holding innocent 
civilians hostage and using humanitarians as human shields for 
more than 6 months. A brutal civil war has been raging in Sudan 
for 10 months, pushing 25 million people to the brink of 
starvation, and these are just a few of the challenges USAID 
has been forced to confront.
    Obviously, there is many others--the chairman made 
reference to a number of those. The pressures on the 
international affairs budget have become too great, and our 
process is overwhelmed.
    We are at a point really where it is time to start making 
some difficult choices, ones we have to make, and to 
prioritize.
    I really feel, unfortunately, this budget does not do that. 
For example, for the third year in a row the Administration has 
requested billions of dollars in mandatory spending to 
outcompete China.
    Well, I agree it is imperative to find ways to compete with 
and counter China around the world. Congress has already 
rejected requests for mandatory funding not one once but twice, 
because by law it really offsets from other critical programs, 
as we all know.
    It is painfully obvious that these funds are being pushed 
into a mandatory request so the Administration can prioritize 
its favored projects in climate and gender within the 
discretionary budget. These budget gimmicks are a dangerous 
game and need to stop if we are all going to pull the wagon 
together.
    It is time for the Administration to take seriously the 
threat China poses to American values and interests and align 
our discretionary budget priorities accordingly.
    Administrator Power, I would like to hear, based on 
reality, how USAID will adapt its budget to address this threat 
after I am sure Congress will reject the third mandatory 
funding request.
    The proposed budget also fails to include funding to meet 
the U.S. obligations of the Budapest agreement relating to 
Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression. It is clear 
that this obligation cannot be met through a supplemental 
appropriations request.
    It needs to be part of a comprehensive strategy, and more 
importantly, be included in the regular budgeting process. On 
the situation in Gaza it is clear UNRWA is a morally bankrupt 
institution beyond the point of redemption, and this has been 
so for years. That is why Congress has prohibited funding for 
UNRWA in 2025 by law.
    It is essential USAID accelerate the scale up of trusted 
implementers without ties to terrorism to replace UNRWA in the 
West Bank and Gaza. We cannot keep wasting time burying our 
heads in the sand hoping UNRWA will magically change. It will 
not. It has not.
    You have got to move faster on getting hooked up with our 
trusted implementers in the region.
    Turning to Afghanistan, the Taliban have erased the rights 
of women and girls. It is imperative we keep educational 
opportunities open, including through distance learning models 
for vulnerable Afghan women and girls. I understand the 
American University of Afghanistan is prepared to scale up to 
meet the need and will be interested in your thoughts on this 
matter.
    In Syria both State and USAID continue to pour funds into 
early recovery and stabilization activities including in regime 
held area. There is a lot of us that are greatly opposed to 
this. This is unacceptable and is opening doors for some of our 
Gulf partners to embrace the regime, again, which we oppose.
    We must ensure all U.S. activities are compliant with 
Caesar sanctions and continue to isolate this regime. I look 
forward to Senate movement on the Assad anti-normalization act 
at its first opportunity.
    Finally, in Africa there are critical issues that require 
USAID's immediate collaboration and partnership with African 
nations and organizations.
    These include deteriorating democracies, more military 
coups and authoritarian rule, unprecedented humanitarian 
emergencies and escalating insecurities that drive armed 
conflict, terrorism, unparalleled levels of displacement. I 
think all of us are disappointed with the direction that the 
conflict is going.
    Not only are these issues causing widespread suffering and 
instability, but importantly, they harm our national interest. 
The President's budget needs to adequately resource USAID and 
other agencies to help address these critical issues. It is 
regrettable the budget request, again, lacks discipline.
    If the Administration cannot prioritize, Congress will have 
to do it. You, USAID, are in a better position to prioritize, 
but it requires very, very tough choices. We know that. I get 
it. Someone has to do it, and it really should be you and not 
us.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Risch.
    Administrator Power, you may proceed.

 STATEMENT OF HON. SAMANTHA POWER, ADMINISTRATOR, U.S. AGENCY 
         FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, WASHINGTON, DC

    Ms. Power. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, 
Ranking Member Risch, and thanks for all the collaboration that 
we have--you, your teams and the committee. It is absolutely 
invaluable. It really feels like whatever our differences, that 
we are on the same team, on Team America, in a really, really 
difficult set of circumstances in the world.
    I just want to start with a reflection on something that 
right now is sitting in the lobby of the Republic of Korea's 
development agency, which is their equivalent of USAID.
    In the lobby they have chosen to display an old bag of 
flour from the 1940s, which is marked with the words ``From the 
American people'' and this is a reminder of how the United 
States supported them when they were one of the poorest 
countries on the planet to help them fight hunger and disease 
and to kick start the remarkable journey toward the kind of 
economic growth that we see today.
    South Korea is today one of the world's richest nations, 
and last year--and this should be really heartening to 
everyone--it spent nearly $4 billion providing aid to other 
nations. This year the Republic of Korea plans to spend nearly 
$5 billion. That is a 30 percent increase.
    The decades that the United States has supported countries 
in charting their own paths of development have in fact brought 
extraordinary results for our partners and for our own people.
    We have helped stop the spread of diseases that threaten us 
all. We have helped develop more resilient high yield crops 
that can feed growing populations. Some of this innovation also 
shows up on American farms subsequently.
    We have helped people and nations rise from poverty, and in 
doing so we have invested billions in U.S. small businesses, 
and we have opened up new markets for American products.
    Eight of America's top 10 trading partners were once 
recipients of U.S. assistance. Under President Biden's 
leadership and in partnership with this committee, we are 
building on that remarkable legacy.
    In Ukraine, USAID has helped farmers withstand Putin's 
attempts to destroy the agricultural sector. We have gotten 
farmers the seeds, equipment, and worked with European Union 
and the Ukrainians to get them the alternative export routes, 
particularly when the Black Sea was almost entirely out of 
commission--the alternate export routes that they needed.
    The results of this are actually staggering, and I feel in 
light of the debate, particularly and the need to get the 
supplemental across the finish line the Senate supplemental 
passed in the House, it is really worth noting that Ukraine's 
grain exports now are very near their prewar export levels.
    That is remarkable. It is a tribute above all to the 
courage and the ingenuity of Ukrainians, but it is also a 
tribute to the decisions made up here to provide USAID with the 
resources to support the agricultural sector, to crowd in the 
private sector, and to get farmers planting, harvesting, and 
exporting again.
    Global food prices, of course, are related to what happens 
in Ukraine on those farms. They are now down 26 percent from 
their 2022 peak, and again, that comes from work on the ground 
helping Ukrainians do what they had every intention of doing 
before Putin began brutalizing their people and their economy.
    In Nigeria we are providing community health workers with 
technologies to spot diseases like tuberculosis early, which 
helped increase TB diagnoses by a third in a single year, so 
that patients can get treatment and outbreaks do not spread 
across the planet.
    Across Africa we are working to connect African and 
American companies and reduce barriers to trade through the 
PROSPER Africa Initiative, efforts that since 2019 have 
generated some $86 billion in trade and investment, and that is 
work that builds prosperity for both our African partners, and 
again, for businesses here at home.
    Bipartisan support for these efforts makes Americans safer 
and more prosperous and provides a critical foundation for 
American influence and leadership in a world where other global 
powers are working aggressively to erode U.S. alliances, to 
undermine democracy, and to diminish basic rights and freedoms.
    For example, the PRC's global lending spree has made it 
now, and this really bears repeating, the world's largest debt 
collector. That is what the PRC has become. For every dollar of 
assistance it provides to low income and middle income 
countries, the PRC has provided around $9 in debt, so a dollar 
in grant for every $9 in debt.
    The opposite is true of the United States. For every dollar 
of debt that we provide, we provide at least $9 of assistance. 
The PRC's assistance tends to be negotiated behind closed 
doors, fueling corruption, and it can demonstrate a flagrant 
disregard for human rights.
    Many of you are familiar with the PRC's Safe Cities 
Initiative whereby they have provided surveillance and facial 
recognition technology that can monitor critics, journalists, 
and activists, that technology provided so far to at least 80 
countries.
    We need American leadership to advance models of 
development and governance that honor freedom, transparency, 
and dignity, as well as economic opportunity for all.
    The Biden-Harris administration's fiscal year 2025 request 
of $28.3 billion for USAID's fully and partially managed 
accounts would give us the resources to continue that 
leadership.
    With these funds we will help nations around the world 
strengthen food security, improve health, and--and this is a 
particular area of emphasis for us, particularly coming out of 
the COVID--is driving economic growth.
    We will respond as well to historic levels of humanitarian 
need. USAID teams have been working day and night to address 
the catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where nearly the 
entire population is living under the threat of famine.
    Add to that the ongoing crises in Ukraine, Sudan, and 
beyond, and continued battering from a growing number of 
natural disasters, and the number of people requiring 
humanitarian assistance--and this is really a staggering 
statistic--has increased by nearly a third from 274 million in 
2022 to 363 million at the end of 2023.
    That is--I do not know that there has ever been a time in 
history where you have seen that amount of growth in under 2 
years, in basically just over a year.
    To meet these needs we will need both the $10 billion in 
this budget as well as the $10 billion in emergency 
humanitarian assistance in the pending national security 
supplemental request.
    Otherwise, we are going to have to make draconian cuts to 
rations all around the world. The fiscal year 2025 request 
recognizes the need for tradeoffs, and it is a very, very 
important point. We really do embrace that reality.
    Crucially, this budget gives us specific resources to help 
us deliver better results and better value for money. We have 
worked really closely with your teams inaugurating our new 
Office of the Chief Economist last July, growing that team.
    That team is helping us expand the use of rigorous data 
analysis across the agency to identify the programs with the 
highest impact per dollar invested so that those programs can 
be scaled.
    I will give you one brief example. They identified a 
poverty reduction program our Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance 
has piloted in Uganda, and this is a program that offers a 
sequenced set of supports like training and financial services 
that help refugees move from requiring humanitarian assistance 
to earning sustainable livelihoods of their own. We want to do 
much more of this around the world, and we have to because of 
the chronic refugee populations.
    For every dollar that we invest households are seeing over 
four times the return in economic benefits in that program, and 
so now we are expanding it to other nations.
    Beyond maximizing our own resources we are drawing in new 
partners through tools like our Edge Fund, and thanks to this 
Congress for resourcing the Edge Fund. Again, we would like to 
see those resources grow over time.
    But this is exactly what we need to be doing at a time 
where the private sector has to drive a lot of development and 
where we have to leverage any resources you give us and turn it 
into more.
    So the Edge Fund is an incentive fund that basically 
applies the private sector's unique comparative advantages to 
some of the world's largest development challenges. We are 
working with companies like Citibank, Wal-Mart, Johnson & 
Johnson, to boost our impact and drive progress beyond our 
narrow programs.
    From fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2023 alone, and this 
is really something that has mattered a great deal to us and I 
hope a great deal to you, private sector partner contributions 
to USAID activities jumped by more than 60 percent, and that is 
the trajectory that we need to remain on. We need to keep 
investing in order to do so in a work force that is nimble, 
able to embrace private sector partnerships, trained 
accordingly, and empowered to pursue catalytic change, to view 
USAID as a hustler and a broker also have other development 
investments.
    If we do make these investments in our work force--and 
thanks for the support for operational expenses--I have no 
doubt that we can continue America's extraordinary legacy of 
leadership in building a more stable and prosperous world for 
all.
    Thank you.

    Thank you Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Risch, and other 
distinguished members of the Committee.

how the U.S. supported them when they were one of the poorest countries 
on the planet to fight hunger and disease and kickstart economic 
growth. Today, of course, South Korea is one of the world's richest 
nations--and last year spent nearly four billion dollars providing aid 
to other nations. This year they plan to spend nearly five billion.
    The decades that the United States has supported countries in 
charting their own paths of development have brought extraordinary

be negotiated behind closed doors, fueling corruption, and can 
demonstrate a flagrant disregard for human rights. To offer one 
chilling example, through the PRC's efforts to help countries build so-
called ``Safe Cities,'' they have provided surveillance and facial 
recognition technology that can monitor critics, journalists, and 
activists to at least 80 countries.
    We need American leadership to advance models of development and 
governance that honor freedom, transparency, human dignity, and 
opportunity for all.
    The Biden-Harris administration's fiscal year 2025 request of $28.3 
billion for USAID's fully and partially managed accounts give us the 
resources to continue that leadership.
    With these funds, we will help nations around the world strengthen 
food security, improve health, and drive economic growth. And we will 
respond to historic levels of humanitarian need. USAID teams have been 
working day and night to address the catastrophic humanitarian crisis 
in Gaza, where nearly the entire population is living under the threat 
of famine. Add to that ongoing crises in Ukraine, Sudan, and beyond, 
and continued battering from a growing number of natural disasters 
during this particularly strong El Nino, and the number of people 
requiring humanitarian assistance has increased by nearly a third--from 
274 million in 2022 to 363 million at the end of 2023. To meet these 
needs, we will need both the $10 billion in this budget as well as the 
$10 billion in emergency humanitarian assistance in the pending 
national security supplemental request. Otherwise, we will be forced to 
make draconian cuts to rations all around the world.
    The fiscal year 2025 request recognizes the need for tradeoffs even 
as global needs are escalating. And crucially, this budget gives us 
specific resources to help us deliver even better value for money. 
Since we inaugurated our new Office of the Chief Economist last July, 
the team is already expanding our use of rigorous data analysis across 
the agency to identify the programs with the highest impact per dollar 
invested so they can be scaled. For instance, they identified a poverty 
reduction program our Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance is piloting in 
Uganda, which is offering a sequenced set of supports like trainings 
and financial services that help refugees move from requiring 
humanitarian assistance to earning sustainable livelihoods for 
themselves. For every dollar we invest, households are seeing over four 
times the return in economic benefits. We are now expanding the program 
to other nations.
    And beyond maximizing our own resources, we are drawing in new 
partners through tools like our EDGE Fund--an incentive fund designed 
to apply the private sector's unique edge to some of the largest global 
development challenges. We're working with companies like Citibank, 
Walmart, and Johnson & Johnson to boost our impact and drive progress 
beyond our programs. From fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2022 alone, 
private-sector partner contributions to USAID activities jumped by 31 
percent. To continue to drive this progress, we need to keep investing 
in a workforce that's nimble and empowered to pursue truly catalytic 
change.
    If we do make these investments, I have no doubt that we can 
continue America's extraordinary legacy of leadership in building a 
more secure, prosperous, and stable world for all.

    The Chairman. Thank you very much for your comments, but 
more importantly thank you very much for your service.
    I just really want to first underline the point you made 
about PRC, China, and their debt diplomacy--debt traps, I would 
say--to other countries.
    It points out how we have to strengthen our own tools in 
order to deal with that issue, but also we need to do a better 
job in public relations and explaining the difference between 
partnerships with the United States and partnerships with the 
People's Republic of China because, as you point out, we 
leverage so that the country can control its fate.
    The PRC leverages so that China can control their fate, and 
that point I think needs to be underscored a lot more than we 
have in the past. I just point that out.
    We are here to talk about the fiscal year 2025 budget but 
we have to first talk about the fiscal year 2024 budget. You 
made reference to the importance of the supplemental 
appropriation bill that passed the U.S. Senate that is now in 
the House of Representatives.
    We have had a lot of discussions in the press and publicly 
about the importance to Ukraine and their military defense 
against Putin's aggression. We have had conversations here 
about the aid in the Middle East to Israel in regards to 
Hamas's attack against Israel.
    We have had discussions here about the importance in the 
Indo-Pacific area against PRC's aggression, particularly as it 
relates to Taiwan.
    We need to concentrate today on the importance in regards 
to humanitarian needs and your ability to carry out your 
mission for the remainder of this year and into next fiscal 
year.
    So I want to concentrate in three areas. We have a 
humanitarian crisis in Sudan. I mentioned that Senator Booker 
was just recently in the country and told many of us about just 
the dire needs that are there. We see every day the challenges 
in Gaza.
    We know we have to do more on the humanitarian front, and 
that requires U.S. leadership and U.S. dollars, and we know 
that in Ukraine we have the humanitarian crisis because of the 
war.
    So tell us how important it is to pass the funds that are 
in the supplemental. We passed the fiscal year 2024 budget. Is 
that enough to deal with these concerns, or do you need the 
supplemental, and how critically important is the supplemental 
to deal with those incredibly challenging crises that we see 
every day?
    Ms. Power. Thank you. I know we do not have a lot of time 
but this is such an important question so let me first start by 
saying that the word supplemental for the countries and the 
crises that you mentioned is in many ways a misnomer.
    Why is that? Because a lot of the resource, and Senator 
Risch alluded to some of this maybe in a different way, but a 
lot of the resources that we had previously channeled through 
the regular budget were moved in previous years to the 
supplemental.
    So if the national security supplemental were not to pass 
or were not to pass at the current level that was sent over by 
the Senate, you would basically be seeing, in terms of 
humanitarian needs including in Gaza, Sudan, and Ukraine, the 
three places you mentioned, you would be seeing in this year an 
increase of, roughly, 40 percent in humanitarian need, and a 
decrease, roughly, of between 35 and 40 percent of humanitarian 
funding.
    So, and that is because, again, we were generously funded 
in the past. We were able to lead in response to crises as the 
numbers of people displaced and in dire need of food to survive 
increased because Congress stepped up, but stepped up also by 
moving resources that had been in the base to the supplemental.
    On Ukraine, without the supplemental we actually have no 
resources to do the kind of energy, agriculture, anti-
corruption work, the core development work that everybody up 
here, I think, supports us doing, but many assume that we have 
resources to do under the regular budget.
    So this just gets to sort of how the budget was organized, 
but it also gets, of course, to the indispensability of these 
needs.
    So on Sudan, on Gaza, on Ukraine, as Putin pulverizes 
communities, as he again tries to weaponize winter and take out 
energy infrastructure with really an unprecedented spate of 
attacks just in recent weeks, it is just heartbreaking that 
resources that Ukrainians need on the ground to be able to 
repair that energy infrastructure, for us to procure far enough 
in advance also so we can look ahead to next winter, because we 
know he is going to pursue the same approach if the war is not 
over by then, that those resources would be so close to passage 
in principle, and yet, where a vote cannot even be taken that 
is--on the package that reflects a bipartisan majority here in 
the Senate is--the human consequences cannot be overstated.
    The Chairman. I would just make one last point on this. We 
all know we need to do more in all three of the areas that I 
mentioned. We see that every day. More has to be done.
    The United States has been the leader in providing the 
resources for these humanitarian responses. If the United 
States does not provide the expected leadership in providing 
resources, what happens with the global community's response to 
these humanitarian needs?
    Ms. Power. Well, as you know, in Ukraine for every dollar 
that the U.S. has provided, other donors have provided $2.
    As we have been stalled on our ability to provide direct 
budget support to the government of Ukraine as Putin seeks to 
destroy its economy and destroy its ability to finance health, 
education, other things, we have asked our partners to front 
load their funding and to step up.
    They have done so with a calculated view on the basis of 
recent history over the last 2 years that America will show up, 
that we cannot abandon freedom, and we cannot leave Ukraine to 
be the victim of aggression at a time like this.
    There is absolutely no guarantee that we would be able to 
continue to leverage our leadership if we are not exercising it 
sufficiently, and that is what is at stake here, and Ukraine is 
just one example.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Risch.
    Senator Risch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    A couple of things you said were really impressive. That 
Korea story is something that needs to be repeated again and 
again in America. We always beat ourselves up and do not talk 
about the successes. That is a tremendous success, and it is 
kind of lost in the fog of stuff that goes on here.
    But to be able to say that not only did we do that, and 
admittedly, we spent a lot of blood and a lot of treasure 
getting there, but not only did we do that, but the fact that 
the Koreans recognize that we did that and give credit to the 
United States for doing that is really an impressive fact.
    The second one that struck me in the comments that you made 
was the comparison of what we do compared to what China does 
and your characterization of China as being the largest debt 
collector in the world I had never heard before, but is 
obviously true because of the tremendous amount of debt that 
they have got out there and that they are collecting in many 
cases from, like, a loan shark collecting it from people that 
cannot afford to pay it.
    And as the chairman pointed out, China uses that to 
actually bolster their national security by controlling what 
happens in another country, which is 180 from what we do.
    So I think both of those points you made are really, really 
good points and really need to be underscored for all of us in 
the United States when we get to feeling badly about how things 
are degrading, and they are degrading in a lot of places as we 
know.
    I do want to talk about a couple of things that you and I 
have talked about before, and that is, look, for years I have 
been saying we need to put UNRWA out of business, and we 
defunded them, as you know, in the 2025 budget, and I have got 
to tell you that is the majority view in Congress. I understand 
there is others that think that UNRWA is--somehow there is some 
good parts of UNRWA.
    If there are I have not seen them yet. It is going to be 
really important, because I really believe Congress is going to 
continue down that line.
    Now, the things that UNRWA does that we have them do--we 
pay them to do and provide the resources for them to do--are 
really important. They need to be done. The best example of 
that is in Jordan.
    What UNRWA does in Jordan is--with our money, is absolutely 
imperative with the millions of refugees that have there. The 
Jordanian government cannot stand without that.
    So tell me about your efforts in that regard to identify 
other implementers, and I assume it is a begrudging transfer to 
other implementers. Tell me what you are doing. Give me some 
hope here.
    Ms. Power. First of all, thank you for recognizing a couple 
of points that I made in my opening comments, and I agree with 
also your implied point, which is that our communications game 
lags behind the facts, and that is a challenge that all of us 
are facing in an environment of misinformation and a very 
cluttered media environment.
    But it is just so important. I think notwithstanding that 
point, which is a very good one, it is interesting to see the 
polling and the turn in public opinion as it relates to PRC 
lending and investment.
    It is also noteworthy that the PRC, in part because they 
are the debt collector and a lot of the debts are not able to 
be collected because the interest rates were so high or because 
of COVID or for whatever reason, they are also pulling back a 
lot.
    If you look at Belt and Road investments they are way, way 
down over the last few years, creating a huge opening for 
America's model of development.
    To UNRWA I think--to answer your question, first of all, 
USAID does not fund UNRWA. The State Department does, but we 
are one U.S. Government trying to mobilize a humanitarian 
response.
    USAID partners like World Food Programme, UNICEF, Save the 
Children, International Medical Corps, are implementing 
partners. They are the ones out there, of course, getting--
seeking to get convoys in to reach people who are facing 
desperate conditions.
    They do rely, as you well know, on the humanitarian 
infrastructure, and there is no ready substitute, and I think 
even maybe just pivoting to Jordan for a second--we can come 
back to Gaza.
    But it is not like another international organization or 
another NGO in the sense that it is the school system for 
refugees in Jordan who, as you know, I think it is 2 million 
kids are cared for by UNRWA run schools.
    So you are talking not about what international 
organizations or NGOs normally--it is not like there is 
hundreds of thousands of teachers from elsewhere who are on 
standby waiting to get the call.
    It is an extremely complex question. But as you note, this 
is something that the Jordanian government does not have the 
fiscal space or the human capacity to take on.
    And so right now other donors, notwithstanding the deeply 
alarming allegations and the investigations that are underway, 
most of them have resumed funding because of the 
indispensability of the services and because of the view that 
notwithstanding, again, very, very problematic allegations 
against specific individuals in Gaza that those allegations do 
not extend across UNRWA funding across the region.
    So right now the UNRWA infrastructure is still being relied 
upon including by USAID's partners. I would note that the 
government of Israel even a month or 2 ago or a month ago said 
UNRWA cannot be involved in convoys inside Gaza because of, of 
course, the allegation infiltration with those individuals 
potentially, and they have had to change that position because 
there is no way to deliver food to prevent further famine 
without UNRWA at the heart of the response.
    So now UNRWA is able to be not leading convoys but part of 
convoys in terms of how the government of Israel is engaging 
with that question. I am not pretending that the government of 
Israel is embracing UNRWA, but I am making a point more about 
necessity and the indispensability of meeting the humanitarian 
imperative.
    Senator Risch. Well, thanks for that. I got to tell you I 
understand all the arguments. But look, if UNRWA is in I am 
out, period. I understand the arguments that oh, they got to be 
there, blah, blah, blah.
    Look, you have seen the texts like I have seen the texts. 
It is U.S. taxpayer money teaching these young kids, these 
young Palestinian kids, how to be a terrorist, and not only how 
to be a terrorist but that it is their obligation under their 
religious practices and everything else.
    It is just sickening, to be honest with you. Then, of 
course, this thing that happened on October 7 where they 
actually had members of UNRWA included in the attack on Israel.
    We have got to go a different direction. So if UNRWA cannot 
do it too bad. I am out. But I have had it with UNRWA, and I 
think a lot of my colleagues are in the same position.
    But in any event, my time is up. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Senator Menendez.
    Senator Menendez. Madam Administrator, it is fair to say 
from your testimony that if you do not get the $10 billion in 
the supplemental that you will not be able to meet your 
humanitarian mission across the globe as it is presently 
challenged?
    Ms. Power. Yes, that is true.
    Senator Menendez. Which means that every day that House 
Republicans wait, people die.
    Ms. Power. There are going to be catastrophic humanitarian 
effects to not bring in more resources to bear, for sure.
    Senator Menendez. They will die on the battlefield in 
Ukraine, and they will die of hunger in various parts of the 
world, and so this is not an esoteric exercise.
    In a bipartisan way the Senate sent a package that would 
meet not only Ukraine's needs, meet our challenge in the Indo-
Pacific, but at the same time meet our humanitarian challenge 
and obligation in the world and the ability to leverage other 
countries.
    And so people are dying. They are dying on the battlefield. 
They are dying of hunger, and for some reason House Republicans 
cannot put a simple vote on the floor, and it is pretty 
outrageous.
    How will you get assistance, assuming you get the money, 
into Gaza? I just heard your whole conversation with Senator 
Risch. Succinctly, please, because I know you have a 
professorial way about you from your history.
    But can you--and since I have limited time how will you be 
able to get assistance into Gaza?
    Ms. Power. Well, the gating issue up to this point--because 
we are drawing on the resources that we do have because we are 
where we are in the fiscal year, we still have resources--but 
the gating issue has not yet been resources. It has been 
access. It has been the restrictions on moving----
    Senator Menendez. So if the gating systems are resolved, if 
the access is resolved, you will----
    Ms. Power. No. No. The access is not resolved.
    Senator Menendez. If the access is resolved, you will have 
the wherewithal to get what aid----
    Ms. Power. For a certain period of time. But I mean, there 
are 20,000 metric tons of flour sitting in Ashdod Port right 
now that we have been trying to get out. That is a thousand 
trucks worth of flour, and that has not been resolved.
    There have been important steps, I think, taken in the last 
few days, and indeed, I think we have more than 400 trucks got 
into Gaza today, which is the second time we have been able to 
cross the 400 truck number.
    So things have improved a bit, and of course, we are trying 
to get food in through multiple entrance points including 
hoping that the government of Israel moves very quickly to open 
the Erez Crossing, but there are still really profound access 
issues.
    Senator Menendez. OK. Let me move to something else.
    Last year I published something I called the Menendez plan, 
which is a framework that would address the cycle of mass 
migration at the southwestern border of the United States 
through the development of a sustainable and structural 
response to migration in the region.
    I think all of our immigration challenges that we have at 
the southern border deny one fact, that there are 25 million 
people in the southern hemisphere presently displaced from 
their country of origin, refugees seeking asylum or just being 
displaced.
    Right now they are in other countries within the 
hemisphere. Unless we work with those countries to assimilate 
those individuals, I do not care what we do at the border, but 
we will have 25 million feet marching northwards.
    So part of what I outlined is an effort to expand 
humanitarian assistance and development of financing to better 
integrate migrants and refugees in those countries across the 
Americas. Capacity building, economic resilience, are paramount 
to that.
    Can you tell me some specifics on how you will utilize the 
funds requested in fiscal year 2025 to address those root 
causes of migration and to help those countries assimilate 
individuals so they are not marching northward?
    Ms. Power. Well, first, this is one of these points that 
does not get made enough, which is just how countries who are 
on the path for migrants who--and we are very focused on those 
who come to our border, understandably, but countries like 
Colombia, Brazil, Peru, just how many, for example, Venezuelans 
have landed on their doorsteps.
    They have maintained open borders. There have been 
regularization or integration rules put on the books in 
countries like Colombia that have been incredibly important 
allowing kids to go to school, get health benefits and the 
like, and there are already now proven economic benefits. A 
huge number of businesses in Colombia created by Venezuelans--
--
    Senator Menendez. That is what they have done. What will we 
do to help them?
    Ms. Power. No. No. USAID is doing a huge amount. For 
example, in Peru we created a program to support the government 
in accrediting professional degrees of migrants who have 
arrived so that they can come and work as doctors.
    In Colombia those programs in the border region that--and 
the migrant centers for regularization, those are ones that 
have been supported with USAID funding. But a lot of these 
programs they have closed their registration eligibility, or 
they have closed down registration, so we are also working 
through development diplomacy to try to urge those governments 
to reopen registration because the vast majority of people who 
come to this country are those who have been unable to access 
regularization.
    Senator Menendez. My time is up.
    Could I ask you to have someone from your agency come and 
sit with our office to discuss what you intend to do? Because 
we have some ideas about how we achieve those goals.
    And finally, if I may, Mr. Chairman, in 2023 Azerbaijan 
launched a military assault on the Artsakh region. It caused 
120,000 Armenians to be ethnically cleansed from what was known 
as their homeland. You activated a disaster assistance response 
team. You have approximately given $15.6 million to Armenia to 
address this. This is $130 per displaced person. It just does 
not work.
    Do you have intentions of doing more?
    Ms. Power. Yes. I was just meeting with the Armenian 
president or prime minister, excuse me, in Brussels along with 
the European Union and Secretary Blinken on Friday, and we 
announced a number of new initiatives there including work with 
the Armenian government and financial support as they attempt 
to provide permanent housing to those people from Nagorno-
Karabakh who have come and have just been in stopgap housing 
since last year.
    As you know, I was at the border trying to greet those 
desperate families who had been forced from their homes, and 
this is something of personal importance to me as is supporting 
the Armenian government in their reform efforts, because 
fundamentally their ability to use also their own resources to 
cater to that population, to integrate that population for 
those who are not able to go home, will turn on them continuing 
to grow their economy, which they have been doing at a fierce 
clip over the last 2 years.
    Senator Menendez. If you could have somebody--when you send 
me somebody on the other who can address this issue, too, I 
would appreciate it.
    Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Ms. Power. Absolutely. Thank you, sir.
    The Chairman. Senator Paul.
    Senator Paul. Ms. Power, on April 26, 2023, you testified 
before this committee that USAID did not fund gain of function 
research. I would like to give you a chance to correct the 
record. Is it still your position that USAID did not fund gain 
of function research?
    Ms. Power. We have no evidence that USAID has funded gain 
of function research, and we certainly have not authorized gain 
of function research.
    Senator Paul. Well, I will help you.
    Behind me we will list a paper from 2015. This is a paper 
produced by the Wuhan Institute of Virology and also by Dr. 
Baric from UNC. In this paper, if you will see, the funding 
aspect that is highlighted, it says USAID EPT predict funding 
from Eco Health Alliance.
    So this paper was one where they took a virus--the SARS 
virus, the backbone of the SARS virus--and then took an S 
protein from an unknown virus they found in the wild and put 
them together.
    Are you aware that these experiments in the study were 
supported by USAID Predict and grant through Eco Health 
Alliance?
    Ms. Power. As I said, USAID has not authorized gain of 
function research. This is the first I am seeing this. We will 
be happy to look into it and engage----
    Senator Paul. All right. This has been around since 2015. 
We have been over it numerous times. It has been in the public 
record. We have repeatedly said that, yes, USAID did fund gain 
of function research--here is the evidence.
    But here is some comments from some different people about 
this study, because some will try to argue this still is not 
gain of function. Simon Wain-Hobson is a virologist at the 
Pasteur Institute in Paris.
    He points out that the researchers have created with this 
research funded by USAID a novel virus that grows remarkably 
well in human cells. If the virus escaped, nobody could predict 
the trajectory.
    Richard Ebright from Rutgers says the only impact of this 
work is the creation in a lab of a new nonnatural risk to 
humanity.
    So is your position that this study was not gain of 
function, or that you did not fund it? Which is your position?
    Ms. Power. We have had an awful lot of back and forth and 
provided thousands of pages of documents on this. This article 
I cannot--it looks like it is from 2015.
    Senator Paul. Right.
    Ms. Power. So we will have to look into the specific 
claims. But again, to put on the record USAID has not and will 
not authorize gain of function research.
    Senator Paul. It is a big point. That is your--I know that 
is your position but the record will show that you did. And 
this was before your time.
    I do not know why we cannot just admit it. It did happen, 
and the reason this is important is many people want to collect 
all these viruses from around the world. But they do not want 
to just collect the viruses to sort of have them and have a 
library of viruses.
    They take the virus, and then they take an S protein from 
another virus, and they create a virus that does not exist in 
nature, that often has ramifications that could be quite 
different or quite serious.
    I will give you the words of the authors of this paper. On 
the basis of these findings scientific review panels may deem 
similar studies building chimeric viruses based on circulating 
strains too risky to pursue.
    So this was funded by USAID. It was funded through the 
Predict program. There is no question of that, and even the 
authors admit that it was gain of function. So we have to get 
beyond sort of quibbling over whether it was because we have to 
make sure in the future we are not doing this and that we do 
not fund this, going forward.
    Now, the Predict program was going to be surpassed by 
another program going after viruses and that has been 
suspended. That is all good. But we have to admit the past, be 
truthful about the past in order to go forward because millions 
of people died from COVID-19.
    The FBI has concluded it came from a lab in Wuhan. The 
Department of Energy has concluded that. Even the CIA 
initially--their scientific board voted six to one. Until they 
were overturned by higher ups at the CIA to say otherwise, they 
voted to say that this thing came from the lab as well.
    It only comes from the lab if we are in favor of creating 
these things. We cannot control everything China does, but we 
certainly should not be funding it. So we have to be honest 
that this was funded.
    Now, there was a warning sign to us that this was going on. 
There was something called the Diffuse Project in 2018 that was 
presented to DARPA once again by Baric and by Dr. Shi in Wuhan.
    The Diffuse Project was to create a coronavirus with a 
furin cleavage site, which does not exist in nature but makes 
it incredibly more infectious in humans.
    There was a briefing to 15 agencies. One of the agencies 
was USAID. There was a briefing about this Diffuse Project.
    But nobody from USAID and nobody from all 15 agencies ever 
told anyone about this project. It was hidden for years and 
years and only revealed by a brave lieutenant colonel Marine 
working at DARPA who exposed this when everybody else had 
hidden this.
    And my question is, USAID was in this briefing about a 
research project that had incredible danger to our country and 
finally was not funded.
    Will you provide the names of the people from USAID who 
were in this meeting so they can be interviewed so we can find 
out why did not they tell anyone, or did they tell their 
superiors and nobody--and people ignored them?
    Why was the public never made aware that they were trying 
to do dangerous research to create a virus very similar to what 
COVID-19 became, and how could 15 agencies show up for a 
briefing and no one exposed it to the public, and we only hear 
about it by a whistleblower? Will you provide for us the name 
of the persons at USAID who attended this briefing in 2018 and 
let us interview them to find out what happened? Why was this 
never revealed to the public?
    Ms. Power. So I think within the 10,000 pages of documents 
you have from USAID are whatever documents we have on this 
DARPA proposers meeting. I received the letter--we received the 
letter from your staff yesterday. We will certainly look at the 
request.
    But just to give a little context, U.S. Government agencies 
often on good days show up for one another, go to each other's 
meetings. This is not something that USAID ever considered 
funding or was ever engaged on in some substantive way. So----
    Senator Paul. But the point is is that after hearing that 
somebody wanted to put a furin cleavage site in the virus, 
alarm bells go off, and then when you see the virus in 2020, 
and you say, oh, my goodness, they did what they were asking, 
someone should have said, wow, I was in that hearing, and I did 
not think anything of it at the time.
    But now I am, like, maybe I should tell somebody. Maybe I 
should call up the President. Maybe I should call up Anthony 
Fauci. Maybe somebody should be informed that we learned about 
this, and I did not think anything of it at the time.
    You are right, it could have been inconsequential in 2018. 
In 2020 it becomes profoundly important. Why did not anybody 
from Government come forward and warn us that this could be a 
virus not from nature, which is not very infectious usually, 
and was incredibly infectious because it had been preadapted in 
a lab for human transmission?
    Ms. Power. Look, I just want to come back to your earlier 
point. All of this ended at USAID in 2020. It is before my 
time. We do not feel defensive about these engagements. We have 
appreciated digging into----
    Senator Paul. That is all we are asking is that we would 
like to interview the person who was at that meeting.
    Ms. Power. I understand. I understand. We will look at that 
request.
    But what I just want to make clear is that in a 
collaborative spirit we also understand the stakes, the human 
stakes, of recent history and the risks, and you have raised 
flags in a manner that has required us to dig in, I think, in 
important ways on top of what we had been doing previously.
    And so we will continue the back and forth with you and 
your office, and certainly do not ever want to be in a position 
to do anything ourselves using taxpayer resources to create 
risks.
    Senator Paul. Thank you. And I do appreciate the 
cooperation that your agency has given us.
    Ms. Power. Thank you, sir.
    The Chairman. Senator Shaheen.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you, Administrator, for being here 
today and for the work that you do every day on behalf not just 
of the United States but of so many people around the world.
    I appreciated your opening story about the Republic of 
Korea and the bag of flour because I just got back from the 
Indo-Pacific during break where we visited the Republic of 
Korea. We had a chance to personally thank them for their 
support for what is happening in Ukraine, the effort to fight 
back against the autocratic and horrendous behavior of Vladimir 
Putin and the Russians in Ukraine.
    And you talked--we also heard that they are following very 
closely not just in the Republic of Korea but in Japan and the 
Philippines and in Vietnam where we also visited what is 
happening with the supplemental because it does affect what 
happens in the Indo-Pacific, and it does affect how the PRC 
views the United States and our willingness to stick with our 
allies.
    And you mentioned, I think, very clearly the importance of 
passing the supplemental, and you talked about what it would 
mean for humanitarian efforts in Gaza. But you did not talk 
about some of the other places around the world where they are 
also depending on the passage of that supplemental.
    Can you talk about a couple of the other areas that you are 
very concerned about that if we--and what will happen if the 
supplemental is not passed by the House?
    Ms. Power. Well, we just had an exchange with Senator 
Menendez about migration. Venezuelan refugees--I mean, such a 
huge share of the population has tumbled into neighboring 
countries, leaving everything behind. Those countries, as I 
mentioned, had been very generous.
    But those countries also depend on the humanitarian 
assistance that agencies like the World Food Programme, UNICEF, 
and others provide. It is asking double if you both ask for 
integration and then ask for all humanitarian needs to be borne 
by the communities and the countries in which those migrants 
land. So it would be horrific if we had to cut rations or 
support to agencies supporting Venezuelan refugees.
    Second, Sudan--a number of people rightly have mentioned 
Sudan. I am looking forward to hearing from Senator Booker 
about his trip.
    But we have been privileged to be able to provide over the 
last year close to a billion dollars in support. That 
privilege, of course, is the perverse consequence of two 
military men who are destroying their country and leaving their 
people, who were able to provide largely for themselves except 
in core conflict areas like Darfur over the last decades but 
has left those people almost entirely in certain communities 
dependent on humanitarian aid.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you very much.
    I think it is safe to say, as Senator Menendez did so 
directly and you acknowledge, that millions of lives are on the 
line here and if this supplemental package does not get passed 
by the House people are going to die.
    They are going to die in Ukraine, they are going to die in 
South America, they are going to die in Africa, and they are 
going to die all over the world, and I hope that those people 
who are holding up that package in the House understand what is 
at stake.
    I want to switch to another part of Europe. I was very 
concerned by last week's news that the Georgian parliament, 
reintroduced the foreign agents law, which would tighten 
restrictions on civil society. That is similar to what Russia 
has passed.
    Can you talk about what the consequences would be for U.S.-
funded civil society organizations if that foreign agents law 
is passed in Georgia?
    Ms. Power. Well, we have seen the cut and paste version of 
the Russia foreign agents bill pop up in multiple places, and 
the effects are less accountability for corruption, a chilling 
effect on speech.
    Certainly, Georgia, which is now on a path or seeks to be 
on a path to Europe and has gotten some recognition of late and 
an embrace of that ambition, fundamentally a foreign agents law 
like that has no place in Europe. The human rights and 
democratic principles need to be not only respected but also 
protected.
    Senator Shaheen. Well, thank you. I hope that the 
government of Georgia will decide to support what the people of 
Georgia want, which is the move toward Europe and the rights 
that come with a full democracy.
    I am out of time but I want to make just one more point 
about the trip that we took to the Indo-Pacific because one of 
the things I was very interested in was hearing from President 
Marcos in the Philippines, from the officials we met in 
Vietnam, the concern about climate change and the impact of 
climate change on the countries in the Indo-Pacific.
    President Marcos told us that the Philippines is the most 
threatened country because of climate change, and they talked 
about the importance of the U.S. leadership on that issue.
    So, I am out of time, as I said, but I hope that you will 
continue to support our efforts to lead on climate change. 
Thank you.
    Ms. Power. Maybe just one point in response, which is one 
of the investments that we have made that we are probably most 
proud of at the agency, particular our humanitarians, is in the 
Philippines' disaster response capabilities, and if you just go 
back 10 years even and look at how much, for example, the 
Defense Department, USAID, and other outside partners were 
doing in order to support humanitarian response and now look at 
the extent to which the Philippines has built out its own 
capabilities in a really impressive way, including a civ-mil 
partnership between the civilian agencies and the military is 
really impressive.
    Thank you.
    The Chairman. Senator Shaheen, I appreciate you mentioning 
the Georgia efforts to adopt the Russian style--Putin style 
foreign agent. We have been very supportive of Georgia's 
integration into Europe and to moving in the right path.
    This is certainly moving in the wrong path, and we have put 
them on notice. I have contacted their Ambassador to let them 
know of our concerns that this really could affect Georgia's 
movement into integration to Europe.
    Senator Romney.
    Senator Romney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Like Senator Menendez indicated I am sometimes overwhelmed 
by the degree of starvation, the migration, as associated with 
climate change, and the problems in the world are so enormous.
    How do you decide where to intervene, and where to spend 
the money? How do you prioritize all the things? I mean, 
because we do not have enough money to get everybody out of 
poverty, to solve all the hunger problems of the world, to 
solve all the migration problems in the world, to solve all the 
awful things that are going on in the world.
    We are not there. There was a time when the U.S. economy 
was half that of the world today. Today it is 15 percent. So we 
simply cannot do everything we would like to do. How do you 
decide where to spend the resources? What is your priority for 
tackling their various challenges?
    Ms. Power. Thank you, and I do not have time, I think, to 
do justice to the full sort of way that we do prioritization. 
We are also 90 percent earmarked so some of that prioritization 
is taken out of our hands.
    But it is only really by sector so your question is still 
very valid in terms of what we do. Even if we have X amount for 
malaria and X amount for TB, where do you do it?
    And there, I think, governance and where that dollar is 
likely to go further matters a great deal, particularly for 
working with state and local government.
    USAID has just last year launched an Office of the Chief 
Economists to actually bring--we have done measurement 
evaluation learning about particular programs for a long time, 
but we are now bringing a best buy mindset, literally doing 
cost effectiveness studies, randomized controlled trials, for 
example a programmatic intervention where we hire a contractor 
or give a grant to an organization--how does that compare 
against giving cash in a particular community and seeing--there 
are some studies that show that through cash benchmarking that 
actually giving just small amounts of cash allows, for example, 
somebody to start a business or get the access to capital that 
they need locally.
    So we want to make sure we do a cost effectiveness filter 
through the work that we do everywhere. We, of course, look at 
the nexus with U.S. security, pandemic prevention, lab 
surveillance, global health security. That is an example of 
investments that have really increased, although unfortunately, 
are down in the 2024 budget that was just passed.
    That is an investment in our lives. The same with our clean 
energy work. Of course, it is one thing to have the Inflation 
Reduction Act here and be lowering emissions over time. But we 
know that there are many big players like South Africa, 
Indonesia, countries in which we work, where their emissions 
affect Americans just as much as ours do.
    Senator Romney. Yes, I actually would hope to have a more 
clear priority that, yes, there has to be an enormous 
humanitarian need, but there also has to be a very clear U.S. 
interest in intervening in that particular area.
    And yes, we do not want to waste money and so forth, and 
you mentioned those things, but there has to be some 
prioritization. My impression is that the Chinese--for 
instance, their economy is about the same size as ours. 
Particularly if you look at purchase power parity, their 
economy is larger than ours on that basis.
    But they are not spending anywhere near where we are in the 
world other than to support Chinese interests. Hopefully, we 
will apply the same metric to decide where we are going to be 
spending our funding.
    Has there been work done at USAID to compare, here is what 
China does? And if there is I would love to see a report or 
some--if there is work like that that is around to say, here is 
how they do it.
    I know they do things with that. They loan the money. We 
say no, we do not do that. We give them money, except we borrow 
the money from others to give the money away.
    Which is smarter? Us borrowing to give it away, or them 
just loaning it? And I think we may have something to learn 
from a country that says they are going to make those 
investments where there is humanitarian need and where it is in 
their national interest, and two, to do it in a way that is 
economically the most frugal.
    Ms. Power. Yes. I mean, I think that there is a fair point 
there, of course, around prioritization, but the PRC does not, 
as you are noting, is not motivated by the humanitarian 
imperative that moves so many Americans. The service impulse, 
the kind of compassion that we have shown----
    Senator Romney. The challenges----
    Ms. Power. No, no, I understand. But I am just talking 
specifically about humanitarian.
    Senator Romney. The needs of the world are so enormous----
    Ms. Power. I understand.
    Senator Romney [continuing]. That when you look at those 
needs, you have to say we have more interest, for instance, in 
Haiti than we might in someplace far, far away, in part because 
it is in our neighborhood. All right. So we are going to show 
priority there.
    We have interest in Ukraine because we know that the old 
Soviet Union did some really bad things that we fought for 
decades, and so we want to keep that from happening again.
    I mean, there are national interests that would strike me 
as being high in the priority. I know my time is up. So, Mr. 
Chairman, I will stop.
    Ambassador Power, if there is something you want to say, 
fine, but I will pull back.
    Ms. Power. Thank you.
    Just simply to say that I believe that that filter is 
applied. I also believe that we play a long game, and had we 
been narrowly transactional in the way that the Chinese are 40 
years ago, many of the countries that are now huge markets for 
U.S. goods would not be markets for U.S. goods.
    Many of the diseases that have been prevented would not 
have been prevented had we just gone, again, in that what 
matters in the here and now and what is our national security 
matrix on this particular day or this particular year.
    We have to have the right balance between absolutely 
looking for that nexus, making sure that our dollars go where 
they are intended, looking out for things that are happening in 
the hemisphere that have a direct bearing, or things that 
relate to disease or the health of Americans for sure.
    But we are also making investments now whose payoff may not 
be evident for some years in the future.
    The Chairman. Senator Van Hollen.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Administrator Power, good to see you for the second day in 
a row, and thanks again, to you and your entire AID team for 
what you do for our country around the world.
    I have some questions on Gaza and some on Sudan, two areas 
where we are experiencing humanitarian crises.
    First on Gaza, I am glad people are still at the table in 
Cairo on a ceasefire and release the hostages deal. It is 
essential that the world put pressure on Hamas to accept the 
deal that is on the table.
    In the meantime, we also need to address, as we discussed 
yesterday, the humanitarian crisis being experienced by over 2 
million Palestinians in Gaza.
    Yesterday I asked you what changes the President and the 
Biden administration want to see from the Netanyahu 
government's approach to the war in Gaza, and you mentioned the 
need to lift unnecessary restrictions on humanitarian aid, and 
you mentioned the need to maximize civilian protection.
    As you know, under the National Security Memorandum No. 20, 
signed by the President the Administration must submit a report 
to Congress by May 8, and that report must determine whether 
Israel, Ukraine, and other countries using U.S. weapons in 
conflicts now have over the last 14 months been sufficiently 
facilitating the delivery of humanitarian assistance, whether 
they have been complying with international law, and whether 
they are using best practices to reduce civilian harm.
    In that regard, I want to know whether you have seen a very 
troubling article written by an Israeli investigative reporter 
about the Netanyahu's government use of artificial intelligence 
systems for targeting in Gaza, one called ``Lavender,'' the 
other called ``Where's Daddy.''
    Have you seen that investigative report?
    Ms. Power. I have not, Senator.
    Senator Van Hollen. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent 
that the report be placed in the record.
    The Chairman. Without objection.
    [Editor's note.--The information referred to above can be 
found in the ``Additional Material Submitted for the Record'' 
section at the end of this hearing document.]
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you.
    So, look, if this report is true it has very troubling 
implications regarding targeting issues, the kind of issues we 
discussed yesterday.
    So I ask two things. One is if you will read it--I have got 
a copy here--and whether you will bring it to the attention of 
your colleagues at the State Department. Can I get your 
commitment to do that?
    Ms. Power. Yes.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you.
    On Sudan, and you know, I was there a number of years ago 
when there was hope that there would be that transition to 
democracy. Obviously, we have seen a complete deterioration in 
the situation there.
    We have, you know, at least two warring parties, one of 
them headed by Hemeti with the Rapid Support Forces, as you 
well recall because you have written about these things was 
part of the Janjaweed and the really genocide in Darfur years 
ago.
    Can you talk about what AID is doing to help displaced 
people in Sudan specifically with respect to those who are 
coming across the border with Chad?
    Ms. Power. I traveled last year back to Chad, all those 
years after the genocide in Darfur when I was last there 
meeting with Sudanese who had been targeted by Hemedti's 
Janjaweed, and the conditions in Chad are very difficult for 
Chadians in that area. It is extremely remote, not a lot of 
access to water, really afflicted by climate change.
    So of the billion dollars nearly in humanitarian support 
USAID or the U.S. Government of which $600 million from USAID 
has provided, a significant share has gone to U.N. agencies and 
others working in Chad.
    I will say, though, that the Sudanese Armed Forces, General 
Burhan, has done something very problematic on top of all the 
other problematic things he and Hemedti have done, which is 
basically make it much more difficult for the U.N. to move 
those convoys across the border to people who haven not been 
able to make it to Chad, and so basically saying this is an 
international border--you know, we get to decide what crosses 
it--fine, but decide that humanitarian aid should cross and 
reach your people, and he has authorized now one crossing 
point, but it is very remote and not nearly sufficient to meet 
the needs because people in Darfur, again, many would like to 
get to Chad but have no means of making the long journey and 
need food and resources where they are.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, thank you. I look forward to 
following up with you and your team on that as well.
    Ms. Power. Thank you.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Senator Ricketts.
    Senator Ricketts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    A couple of my colleagues today have talked about the 
supplemental and the consequences of not getting the 
supplemental, saying people are going to die.
    I would reply to all my colleagues, both the House and the 
Senate, that Americans are dying today of drug overdose. The 
leading cause of death of young Americans in this country today 
is drug overdose, the biggest part of that fentanyl, 70,000. 
And I am talking about young Americans. I am talking 18 to 45, 
leading cause of death.
    Since the Biden administration's open border policy, in my 
State, Nebraska, we have seen the impact of this. When I was 
Governor, law enforcement in 2019 took 46 pills laced with 
fentanyl off our streets. Just 2 years later that number had 
skyrocketed to 151,000--2021, 151,000.
    For the first 2 years of the Biden administration we saw 
the amount of methamphetamine in our State double, fentanyl 
triple, cocaine up by 10 times.
    So yes, we want to take care of people around the world. We 
need to take care of our people, and it is foolish, in my 
opinion, to think that we can pass the supplementals additional 
aid if we cannot get something done with our southern border.
    To switch topics, I want to build on what Ranking Member 
Risch was talking about with regard to UNRWA because, again, we 
see a huge problem here with an organization that, as the 
ranking member talked about, its textbooks preach hate and 
killing Jews.
    The schools were hiding weapons. We saw that the IDF 
discovered in February that Hamas had an intelligence hub right 
under UNRWA's headquarters in Gaza, which UNRWA denied knowing 
anything about. Like you did not hear the people digging? It 
seems incredulous to me that they could deny that.
    So given the problems that UNRWA has had and not only has 
with this current attack by Hamas in Israel on October 7, but 
previously under the Trump administration they cut off funding 
to UNRWA because of similar type problems--so this is not a 
surprise.
    This is an ongoing problem. So Administrator Power, my 
question to you is there is an investigation going on. There is 
an independent panel that has a final report yet to be released 
but its interim report found that ``UNRWA has mechanisms in 
place to ensure its neutrality,'' quote/unquote.
    If those mechanisms are in place, why is this still a 
problem, and how confident are you in the efficiency or 
efficacy of these investigations and the U.N.'s ability to 
properly and unbiasedly investigate itself?
    Ms. Power. Well, let me say there, and just, again, USAID 
does not fund UNRWA, and so there are others in our Government 
who are more versed in the investigation and procedures.
    But there are the two investigations, one, into the initial 
list of 12 to 15 individuals who were named in these horrific, 
despicable allegations, and then an outside investigation that 
I think is independent and of which I think we have reason to 
think it is independent looking at the policies and procedures 
of UNRWA that could have given rise to a situation whereby 
individuals who were plotting an attack and such horrors could 
be members of an international organization or employees of an 
international organization.
    So those are the two investigations. I think the only thing 
I would say is that, as I said in one of the earlier exchanges 
but maybe just to elaborate, is UNRWA has the trucks, the 
staff, the infrastructure, and a large number of UNRWA 
employees are serving selflessly to try to address the famine 
conditions in certain parts of Gaza and the imminent famine 
conditions in other parts of Gaza.
    And so I think that is just the other imperative here that 
we are being very sensitive to, and again, USAID, the U.S. 
Government, we are going to follow U.S. law. There should be no 
question about that.
    But it is hard to imagine how humanitarian needs can be met 
even if access improves at the scale it needs to improve 
without these workers, those who are not implicated in these 
allegations being part of the solution.
    The other thing I would say is that Hamas was the governing 
authority in Gaza prior to October 7. I suppose we can have 
some hope--I am not sure now we yet know the details of how 
this will transpire--but that if Hamas is dismantled that the 
governing structure who would be involved in decisions, for 
example, around school textbooks and the like, that they would 
go into a fundamentally different direction.
    But at this point that is a long ways off, and that is with 
regard to some of the things that caused the Trump 
administration to cut off funding in the past like issues with 
textbooks.
    Senator Ricketts. Are there some recommended reforms that 
you would recommend to UNRWA? Can you think of things that 
maybe you have seen in your experience that UNRWA is not doing 
that they ought to be doing, or things, given the what has 
coming to light with regard to what UNRWA employees have been 
doing with regard to perpetrating these horrible atrocities? 
Can you think of some reforms?
    Ms. Power. Again, first thing I would say is that I would 
disaggregate UNRWA and look at UNRWA in Jordan, UNRWA in 
Lebanon, UNRWA in Syria, UNRWA in the West Bank, UNRWA in Gaza.
    Of course, there are procedures and policies across those 
different areas, but I think it is really important to 
understand, again, how completely unusual this is compared to 
other international organizations or NGOs.
    We do not have NGOs filled with teachers or doctors, but 
UNRWA has taken on a kind of quasi-state role in some of the 
places that I have mentioned.
    I think clearly the vetting--if you have members of Hamas 
who are perpetrating or alleged to have perpetrated attacks or 
involvement in horrific terrorism of the kind that transpired 
on October 7 and lives on through the hostages that are still 
in custody, clearly, that is something that they are going to 
want to think very differently about.
    Senator Ricketts. One of the UNRWA employees was involved 
in an attack on a kibbutz that killed 97 people and resulted in 
26 being taken hostage. I mean, this is very, very serious 
stuff for the UNRWA people.
    So I know that I am out of time, but thank you, 
Administrator Power.
    Ms. Power. Thank you, Senator.
    The Chairman. Senator Kaine.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and Administrator 
Power, good to see you. I want to stick with the discussion 
about Gaza.
    Mr. Chair, I would like to enter into a record an article 
from The Hill that was from Sunday titled ``Cindy McCain says 
Gaza on the edge of going over the cliff with famine and not 
being able to recover.''
    Cindy is the widow of our former Senate Foreign Relations 
colleague John McCain, a dear friend.
    I know, Administrator Power, you----
    The Chairman. Without objection it will be included in 
record.
    [Editor's note.--The information referred to above can be 
found in the ``Additional Material Submitted for the Record'' 
section at the end of this hearing document.]
    Senator Kaine. Thank you.
    I know you work closely with the World Food Programme and 
you know Cindy McCain. Do you share that concern that she 
expressed just 3 days ago that Gazans are on the verge of very 
serious risk of famine?
    Ms. Power. Yes. I mean, I think the report that was done, 
which drew on, really, the gold standard of how we measure 
these things is very clear on this matter, and WHO is already 
reporting deaths related to conditions stemming from 
malnutrition.
    And to just put this in some context because it is clear 
that the humanitarian circumstances were not great in Gaza 
before October 7, but before October 7 there was almost no 
child malnutrition whatsoever and now close to one in three in 
northern Gaza.
    And if you look at the severe acute malnutrition where you 
measure with the circumference access is very difficult for 
organizations that measure these things. But just from January 
to February, not taking account the last 6 weeks, severe acute 
malnutrition doubled among under five kids.
    So we are and Cindy, of course, are USAID's great 
collaborator, and her teams were very eager to get food in 
there but also very specifically to address the under five 
needs, which require ready to use therapeutic food so very 
specific kind of assistance, and we are hopeful that some of 
the changes that have been made and are being contemplated but 
need to be made urgently by Israel will allow us to flow in 
resources to nip what is a famine fundamentally in the bud.
    Senator Kaine. I asked Secretary Austin yesterday at an 
Armed Services Committee hearing whether growing famine or 
medical catastrophe in Gaza would escalate violence in the 
region, and he said absolutely it would.
    The activities of Hezbollah in the north, the activities of 
the Houthis in the Red Sea, the activities of Iranian backed 
militias in Iraq and Syria, possibly activities of Iran itself, 
will only escalate at a time when we need to be looking for 
deescalation, a hostage deal, a ceasefire, deescalation in the 
region.
    So we have a compelling interest, we, the United States, 
the world, Israel, Gaza, Palestine, to avert this widening 
humanitarian catastrophe. Israel, of course, must defend itself 
against any who would annihilate it, including Hamas, Hamas, 
who carried out the attack, who celebrated it, who says they 
will do it again.
    But this should not be a war against Gazans or 
Palestinians. It should be a war against Hamas, and one of the 
main bits of evidence about what is it is the access to 
humanitarian supplies, especially food and medicine.
    We were getting about 500 trucks a day of supplies into 
Gaza before October 7. It was in the single digits or dozens 
for months and months and months. It took long to open the 
Kerem Shalom border crossing.
    I do applaud President Biden in his conversations last week 
with Prime Minister Netanyahu subsequently. Kerem Shalom has 
been opened wider in terms of more supplies in. There has been 
a commitment to open the Erez border crossing, and we see the 
pace picking up.
    Israel has restored water service into the north of Gaza. 
Israel has allowed bakeries to open again to make bread and 
food for Gazans. The pace of the trucks per day exceeded 300 
for the first time on Sunday and got near 500 on Monday.
    But it has taken way too long, way too long, to get 
supplies to suffering Gazans. Gazans are suffering under Hamas 
not--they are not all Hamas.
    And so I would just like to ask you, I know as USAID you 
work with these NGOs, many of which were troubled, frightened, 
scared, backed off of their activities after the attack on the 
World Central Kitchen convoy.
    Talk to me about what USAID can do in your remit to provide 
more confidence that humanitarian aid can be delivered at 
scale.
    Ms. Power. Uh-oh. The poster board----
    The Chairman. That is the next----
    Ms. Power. Yes. No, no, I know. I know. I am just--he makes 
an entrance.
    The Chairman. You got to get through Senator Kaine first.
    [Laughter.]
    Ms. Power. So, look, what I would say is that I traveled to 
the region last month, and the nature of my engagement kind of 
mirrors the way you have played back some of the progress that 
has been made lately which is saying to the IDF and to the 
prime minister and to the government these things are going to 
be done.
    The situation is going to get so bad that these additional 
steps are going to be taken. Just take them--take them now hard 
as it is and understanding the domestic politics and public 
opinion after what Hamas did, and unfortunately, a lot of time 
has been lost. And the commitments are really welcome but the 
commitments need to be executed including an additional 
crossing into the north--not just the agreement to do it but 
the actual crossing.
    And you are right that the number of trucks is up, and that 
is incredibly important, but I think we also need to give some 
context here which is you are also right that 500 trucks were 
entering before October 7.
    But that was commercial. That was humanitarian. It was not 
as if every family was in need of humanitarian assistance. Now 
every family pretty much, I think, is in need of humanitarian 
assistance, and if you think of the destruction of anything 
that one had in their home, markets, granaries, arable land--
the bulldozing of arable land--and what you describe, which is 
how few trucks were getting in over such a long period of time, 
we just have so much catch up to do.
    Apart from the fact that whole towns where people lived no 
longer exist in the way that they did where more than half of 
the buildings have been destroyed or damaged or are 
uninhabitable in some fashion.
    So this is just unlike any of the environments that I have 
worked in in the past or our partners have worked in where 
there is some kind of reliable place where people can either 
start to rebuild their lives or imagine that the war ends, and 
they can return to the lives they had and begin to grow their 
land again.
    I mean, all of that is going to take so long. So it just 
underscores, again, the importance of passing the national 
security supplemental request so we have the resources to help, 
but understanding that the access issues and the protection 
issues where humanitarians can actually do their work safely, 
that those are commitments that have been made or followed 
through on.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate that.
    Mr. Chair.
    Ms. Power. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Senator Cruz.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Administrator Power, welcome. You are here today asking the 
committee to authorize USAID to receive and spend American 
taxpayer money.
    In your prepared testimony you noted that USAID teams have 
been working day and night to send some of those resources to 
the Hamas controlled Gaza Strip.
    How much money has USAID sent to the Gaza Strip during the 
Biden administration?
    Ms. Power. Just first let me say that the Hamas controlled 
Gaza Strip I think is not--I think the IDF would disagree at 
this point that that is an accurate characterization. I would--
--
    Senator Cruz. Who was the elected leadership in Gaza?
    Ms. Power. No. No. That is, again----
    Senator Cruz. That would be Hamas, right?
    Ms. Power. Correct. But would you say that Hamas is 
controlling the Gaza Strip now?
    Senator Cruz. Well, thankfully, no----
    Ms. Power. So I am--that is the whole point.
    Senator Cruz [continuing]. Because the Israelis are killing 
terrorists and the Biden administration is doing everything 
they can to try to stop the Israelis from killing the Hamas 
terrorists.
    So my question, how much money has USAID sent to Gaza 
during the Biden administration?
    Ms. Power. I have not tabulated year to year what the 
investments have been. But we--as you know, the previous 
Administration cut off assistance to the West Bank and Gaza so 
it took a year and a half for us to begin to----
    Senator Cruz. I think it is an exceptionally bad idea to 
give money to people who want to kill us.
    Ms. Power. That is not USAID's approach.
    Senator Cruz. I just want to be clear. You are testifying 
today. You do not know how much American taxpayer money you 
have already spent in Gaza but you want more.
    Ms. Power. No. No, you are asking a question a specific 
way, and I will get you the specific numbers.
    Related specifically to Gaza, our resources often go to 
grantees or contractors who are working in the West Bank and 
Gaza. So you are slicing it narrowly to Gaza. I just do not 
want to say something that is inaccurate.
    Senator Cruz. OK. Well, let us try this from another 
direction. Since Hamas's October 7 attacks the Biden 
administration has surged aid into the Gaza Strip. Now, you are 
not able to tell us how much.
    Ms. Power. No, that was not your question.
    Senator Cruz. But--well, OK, if you can tell us how much 
since October 7 I will take that too.
    Ms. Power. OK. We, I think, have announced between USAID 
and the State Department somewhere around $100 million. But 
that money has not necessarily moved into Gaza if you know what 
I mean. I mean, this is to get money into the pipeline to get--
--
    Senator Cruz. So how much has moved into Gaza since October 
7?
    Ms. Power. That I cannot say.
    Senator Cruz. Well, there are U.N. and American Government 
data bases that lists some of the aid. When you take a look at 
the data bases for 2023 and 2024, you find about $40 million in 
grants to NGOs and U.N. agencies that are marked confidential, 
and you will also find that millions of dollars of that aid was 
actually cash. Which NGOs and U.N. agencies received that 
money?
    Ms. Power. Again, I would want to go through and give you 
the proper breakdown. But the partners that we rely on and 
provide the most assistance to would be the World Food 
Programme, UNICEF, International Medical Corps who, for 
example, are running a hospital in southern Gaza seeing 600 
patients a day.
    The partners--if we are talking about the humanitarian 
assistance, which is where we have surged assistance, we are 
talking about trusted partners that USAID works with all over 
the world.
    Senator Cruz. So who are the individuals who have received 
cash?
    Ms. Power. The individuals would be, in the case of the 
World Food Programme, which in order to keep markets going so 
that people are not forever dependent on humanitarian 
assistance, or to give people the ability to make it possible 
for markets to exist, these are voucher assistance programs, 
and they go to lists of beneficiaries who are identified by the 
World Food Programme on the ground. So Gazans. Gazan civilians.
    Senator Cruz. Well, when you say Gazan civilians how much 
of the aid, cash or otherwise, do you assess that has been 
diverted directly to Hamas?
    Ms. Power. We do not have reports from our partners about 
diversion by Hamas, and I would say as well that the government 
of Israel is not shy about presenting to us evidence of things 
that it finds problematic, UNRWA being the most glaring 
example, and this is not something that has come to our 
attention in other ways as well, and they are monitoring----
    Senator Cruz. Well, I will say----
    Ms. Power. To be very clear, Senator, just if I could say 
one more thing. The government of Israel has eyes on everything 
that goes into Gaza.
    There is no other way in that does not go through COGAT, 
and so it is really important to bear that in mind that the 
system that has been in place since October 7 is the most 
stringent and vigilant form of surveillance that I have ever 
seen in my----
    Senator Cruz. OK. So you say you do not have any evidence, 
but if you take a look--you mentioned the poster board and let 
us look. USAID's own inspector general says that Hamas diverts 
humanitarian assistance. Specifically that the entire Gaza 
Strip is a, quote, ``high risk for potential diversion and 
misuse of U.S. funded assistance.''
    The State Department makes the very same assessment. When 
they restarted aid in 2021 over my objections and the 
objections of many others, they made an internal assessment 
that there was a, quote, ``high risk the aid would benefit 
Hamas.'' That is the Biden State Department. That is the USAID 
Office of the Inspector General.
    What are you doing to stop this money from going to Hamas? 
And to be clear, if you go online right now you can see videos 
of Hamas terrorists riding on top of aid trucks. And so saying, 
we do not have any evidence this is happening, when your own 
agency says there is a high risk of this happening, that is not 
credible.
    Ms. Power. No. No. This is an entirely appropriate fraud 
alert in the most complex operating environment on planet 
Earth, which calls on USAID, the OIG staff themselves, and our 
partners to be excessively vigilant and to remind partners that 
they have to report----
    Senator Cruz. Do you agree with the inspector general that 
there is a high risk of Hamas diverting the aid?
    Ms. Power. There is a high risk in any environment where 
you have armed elements. That risk is there, and in, again, 
this really, really unprecedented situation where you have such 
a small number of crossing points and such intense focus not 
only on the aid as it crosses, but also on what happens to the 
aid with IDF soldiers patrolling through Gaza----
    Senator Cruz. I have to say it is remarkable. You cannot 
tell us how much money has gone into Gaza.
    Ms. Power. No. No. You did not ask the question. That is 
not fair, Senator.
    Senator Cruz. You cannot tell us what has happened to stop 
it from going to Hamas.
    Ms. Power. You asked a totally different question at the 
beginning. You said how much over the duration of the Biden 
administration.
    Senator Cruz. I asked it both ways.
    Ms. Power. No, no. And then I answered. I said, roughly, 
around $100 million, which it looks like is on your poster 
board saying--this looks like that is what the inspector 
general, the figure that he used as well.
    So my point is this is exactly the right set of questions. 
This is our responsibility to prevent diversion, to look into 
any allegation. Our partners know that when something like that 
happens they have to report it to the OIG and to USAID, and we 
have a set of investigation measures and remediation measures 
that we have to take when that happens.
    Look, what you have is severe hunger, desperate civilians. 
You definitely have--and again, the government of Israel 
itself--this is something I talked to the prime minister 
about--recognizes that the level of food scarcity in Gaza has 
made civilians act in a manner that has undermined the 
traditional humanitarian system, where it is very hard for 
trucks even to get to their destinations because civilians come 
and charge the trucks as you would and I would if our kids--or 
we might if our kids were as hungry as kids in Gaza are.
    So I think the main--I do not want to call it assurance 
because we have to verify, then trust. But the main point I 
would underscore is that the IDF is omnipresent in Gaza.
    The Israeli government is omnipresent in the humanitarian 
pipeline going to Gaza, and they retain the ability to keep 
track of what is happening on the ground, and they recognize 
that there is also a security and a huge stability risk--they 
appear to recognize, I hope they recognize--of allowing so 
little food to reach civilians who are in such dire straits.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you.
    The Chairman. I had mentioned earlier, Senator Booker, we 
thank you for your visit to Sudan and briefing many of us as to 
the current humanitarian crisis in that area. So we thank you 
for that, and you are recognized.
    Senator Booker. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank 
you for this committee, and Administrator Power, it is great to 
see you but even more it has just been great to work with you 
and your extraordinary team who probably does not get the kind 
of attention and gratitude they deserve as well.
    I am grateful for that you are here. Listening to some of 
my colleagues I share their urgency and an urgency I know you 
share to deal with this gruesome, awful, tragic humanitarian 
crisis in Gaza.
    The urgencies are paramount to deal with the challenges not 
just with the food insecurity and the near famine like 
conditions, but also the medical needs, the trauma. There is no 
way we can ever get to the peace and strength in that region 
that that we urgently need or the independence and strength of 
the Palestinian people relies upon us addressing this crisis, 
and I am grateful for your focus.
    But so many of the things that I am saying also could be 
said about what is going on in Sudan right now, and it is a 
crisis in terms of proportion that is perhaps the fastest 
growing humanitarian crisis on the planet right now at a scale 
and number that are even difficult to get your head around.
    As you know, the conflict is causing a spiraling toward 
mass famine in the Darfur region, which is accelerating the 
refugee problem into surrounding nations.
    As the chairman just said, I was in Sudan and have now 
talked to many leaders within the State Department as well as 
other aid workers who have been to that--where I have been, and 
all of us have the same thing.
    We have seen refugee camps from Syrian refugees in Jordan 
to--I have been around this globe, but none of us have seen 
anything like the level, the scale, the ocean of human crisis 
that we witnessed there.
    And what compounds this problem is it is not just the 
hunger crisis and the famine like conditions, increasing 
numbers. About 90 percent of the people you see are women and 
children and the growing numbers of people that are 
malnourished, facing starvation, who come but the endemic 
nature of the sexual violence that is also really apparent.
    And so we have talked about this in private conversations, 
but the desperation of the aid workers I encountered who do not 
know where the next resources are going to come from. Their 
needs are less than 10 percent funded, and I am wondering if 
you can speak to that.
    And then the other area of questioning I want to do is, you 
are dealing with a population that has been so traumatized and 
victimized and brutalized that the need is not just food and 
water, which is so apparent in that area that I witnessed in 
Adre, but I am wondering how we can begin to address some of 
the larger issues of trauma that are so destabilizing the Sahel 
in general that really put us into a crisis after Niger, 
Burkina Faso, Mali, that had everybody that I visited in that 
region really concerned about how this crisis is going to 
further destabilize the region if we do not begin to address 
the full needs of the of the community of people who are 
suffering.
    Ms. Power. Well, I thank you, Senator, for traveling there, 
for also the number of Senators who have spoken while you were 
out of the room about your trip and you briefing on the trip 
and the impression you have made on your colleagues is part of 
what we need more of.
    There is not enough focus. It is a very hard time now to 
get attention irrespective of the gravity of harm that you are 
suffering on planet Earth because the needs are so substantial, 
up 40 percent this year from last year, and they were up last 
year from the year before, and it is--the level, the pace of 
increase, is really staggering. There is very little good news 
or positive I can say, I guess, about Sudan except I think you 
have engaged a lot with our new Special Envoy.
    Fundamentally, there has to be a political agreement. We 
are not going to humanitarian aid our way out of this 
humanitarian crisis. The guns have to fall quiet. Even a 
ceasefire--a protracted ceasefire would be something, would 
allow more access.
    So I am grateful that Special Envoy Perriello is on the 
case, and U.N. Special Representative also now have an 
empowered Special Envoy Lamamra. So that is politically--I 
think it is, again, just a process point. It does not get us 
anywhere until it does.
    But I think it is better than not having that senior 
engagement. There is also a pledging conference that the French 
are convening in Paris, as you probably know, on April 15.
    So I mentioned that the U.S. Government has given almost a 
billion dollars over the last year, $600 million of which is 
from USAID. But we have not seen other donors step up and do 
their share.
    Again, everything is connected to everything else with the 
war in Gaza. They might be funding UNRWA in a way that we are 
not, and they may say when we say what about Sudan.
    And so it is very, very complicated just given the level of 
global need, but I absolutely share your assessment and sense 
of urgency.
    And on the psychosocial just briefly, this is the--again, 
the challenge, which is the sheer number of people dependent 
on, as you said, basic food and water or medicine to stay 
alive, and all programs come out of the same pot of money.
    In order not to carry their trauma and become potentially 
destabilizing members of their own community or be susceptible 
to recruitment or just to suffer for the rest of their lives, 
we need to supplement these life saving interventions with life 
changing and healing psychosocial support.
    We have programs like that in Sudan, but they are quite 
modest, again, given the access issues and the primacy of 
keeping people alive to get to the point where we can hopefully 
do some of that follow on care.
    Senator Booker. And I just want to be respectful of my 
colleague from Illinois but just ask one more question. But in 
the town of Adre on the border of Sudan and in Chad--Chad is 
already one of our top 10 lowest income countries--less than 10 
percent of the country is even electrified--and it is so urgent 
for me to let folks understand that you even have Chad folks 
suffering such poverty going to see if they can get aid from 
the places that are being set up to deal with Sudan and Sudan 
refugees.
    It is such an interwoven a crisis that could really affect 
that region, and so investments in humanitarian aid are really 
investments in economic security, political security, and 
basically dollars invested in supporting these populations save 
tremendously more dollars, not to mention the efforts of global 
competitors like Russia trying to exploit these areas.
    And so I guess the one thing I will ask you and then yield 
to my colleague, if you could just--I am trying to get you on 
the record, and this implication for the world as well as for 
what I saw in Chad in the town of Adre is the supplemental, and 
a lot of people are casting the supplemental in terms of Indo-
China, in terms of Israel/Gaza, in terms of Ukraine, and these 
are all incredibly urgent moments that capture a lot of the 
attention of the public.
    But when it comes to the supplemental's urgency for what we 
see on the continent of Africa and the urgent importance of the 
continent of Africa, could you just speak to that, why keeping 
the humanitarian aid is so critical in the global context, but 
specifically for Africa?
    The Chairman. If you could be brief we would appreciate it. 
We have covered it before.
    Ms. Power. I will. Just to reinforce a point I made 
earlier, which is that the word supplemental in the context of 
humanitarian assistance is a misnomer because our base 
humanitarian budget is down 40 percent in the 2024 bill from 
what it was as enacted in fiscal year 2023 and needs.
    We did not have the war in Sudan a year ago. A year and a 
week ago, I guess, we got it. But this supplemental is not only 
a life and death issue for the kinds of refugees we have been 
able to sustain since that war began, but as you said, there 
are all these dogs that are not barking because of U.S. 
leadership, and it is very hard to do the counterfactuals and 
so forth.
    But how many of the people who receive humanitarian 
assistance funded by the United States at these higher levels 
that we had last year, what happens when those rations get cut, 
when they cannot show up and get access to resources?
    Where do they go? Where do the young men among them go? 
There are plenty of players on the scene including Boko Haram, 
who had a horrific spate of attacks in Chad as well as in 
Nigeria and elsewhere.
    ISIS and its affiliates--I mean, this is a pool of 
individuals and who are themselves displaced but also those 
host communities that have nothing to begin with that we have 
to find ways to support to get through this crisis.
    But we cannot just focus on the humanitarian without 
attention to the political, because the real challenge right 
now is wars are not ending. They keep getting added to the 
ledger. Funding is actually going down, not up, even as needs 
are going up, and even with the supplemental our funding will 
be down commensurate to the need.
    But investment in the diplomacy and the political processes 
as well to put enough pressure on those players who are causing 
this havoc and this devastation in the first place is key.
    Sorry, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Senator Duckworth.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good 
morning, Administrator Power.
    As someone who focuses a great deal on the Indo-Pacific, I 
want to applaud the agency's focus on boosting economic growth, 
economic resilience, and economic connectivity between our 
allies and partners in the region, and I know firsthand that 
this economic work is important, and it is what our partners 
want.
    The request submitted includes $2 billion in mandatory 
funding over 5 years for State and USAID to support our 
economic strategy in the region, and I wanted to invite you to 
comment on how funding this request can provide real impact for 
countries like the Philippines and Vietnam who are on the 
frontlines of increasing PRC aggression.
    Ms. Power. Well, only because I have traveled not that long 
ago to Vietnam I would just highlight the strategic upgrade in 
the relationship between the United States and Vietnam, and we 
mentioned earlier Cindy McCain, and I often think of Senator 
McCain, Senator Kerry, and the work that was done to plant 
those seeds long ago, and now you have a comprehensive 
strategic partnership with Vietnam, investments in young 
people, in education, in their tech sector.
    I just met with senior Vietnamese officials here a couple 
weeks ago about their interest in building a semiconductor 
industry that can have profound impacts for us and our supply 
chain resilience.
    I mean, really, the sky is the limit, and the opening by 
the people, which is an incredible thing to experience going to 
Vietnam all these decades after war and being so welcomed.
    One of the things USAID has done is invested in the war 
legacy issues including remediation of the toxins that were 
left by Agent Orange in the war and addressing communities who 
have been afflicted with disabilities and trying to support 
them, but just the potential for that relationship to move 
forward, the Philippines as well.
    A major upgrade, I think, we are seeing in those dynamics, 
and USAID's investments are in marginalized communities, people 
who maybe have not been part of economic growth. But as those 
countries seek to move toward more inclusive economic growth, 
for us to be there to build their national capacities to deal 
with disasters, particularly in light of climate change and all 
the extreme weather events.
    But again, I think we have come a long way, and a free and 
open Indo-Pacific is so entirely in the interests of the 
American people that it is something that we must continue to 
pursue.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you.
    And sort of moving on from your comments about the post-war 
work that you are doing and the relationships that you are 
building, I am interested in your perspective on interagency 
cooperation on the ground especially across the three Ds of 
diplomacy, development, and defense in places where USAID's 
public servants are working in challenging and often hostile 
environments.
    Those of us who have had boots on the ground appreciate the 
challenges of coordinating among multiple U.S. Government 
agencies in conflict affected areas. But despite the challenges 
our National Security Strategy requires the effective and 
efficient use of all the elements of national power including 
development assistance.
    Can you provide examples of successful interagency 
cooperation particularly between USAID and the Department of 
Defense in recent humanitarian or developmental efforts?
    Ms. Power. Well, let me say I think we and the interagency 
progress every year on this and get stronger and stronger. I 
think the civ-mil ties among our agencies you might even find 
unrecognizable from the time of your service in the sense that 
they are much stronger.
    Just some examples--the number of detailees that we have 
from the Defense Department at USAID. We have a senior 
development advisor in each of the combatant commands around 
the world.
    And you asked for examples--the example of the large 
airlifts of supplies into Al Arish in the early days of the 
Gaza war by DOD. USAID funded supplies on DOD planes working 
that through, obviously, the collaboration now on creating a 
maritime corridor into Gaza.
    I had mentioned earlier the number of natural disasters 
that afflict the Philippines. It is just--and growing, it 
appears. every year. The work that DOD has done with its 
counterparts in building disaster resilience and we, USAID, 
have done with our civilian counterparts, and I think the real 
testament to a 3D mindset is DOD being the one to consistently 
send the message of the importance of a civilian led response 
when a national emergency--obviously, militaries can have 
capabilities that need to be turned to in a difficult 
circumstance but making sure that the response does not get 
overly militarized.
    Those kinds of messages coming from USAID is one thing, but 
coming from our Defense colleagues just makes an enormous 
difference.
    Senator Duckworth. And I think it is also critically 
important in places like Africa where you have some real 
security challenges for your personnel on the ground as well, I 
would expect.
    Ms. Power. Yes. I mean, absolutely the--unfortunately, 
between coups and conflicts the collaboration on basic 
questions of the security of USAID staff, U.S. personnel more 
broadly, but also questions around evacuations and contingency 
planning, all of that is required and needs to be constantly 
updated in light of the circumstances.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you, and thank you for your 
continued service.
    Ms. Power. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Duckworth. Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Well, Ambassador Power, let me make one 
comment here about the humanitarian crisis we have in Gaza. It 
is urgent. We have got to get aid in there. We have got to do a 
better job.
    But I mention that because currently there is active 
negotiations in regards to a pause in hostilities and the 
release of hostages, and it appears that Hamas is being 
extremely difficult.
    I would hope we would see more international pressure on 
Hamas to release the hostages so that we can move forward with 
closure for many Israeli families and many international 
families.
    There are 133 individuals that are still not accounted for. 
We know some are deceased. We know some are alive. We do not 
have--we never had international organization accountability on 
these individuals.
    I mention that because it is just a horrific humanitarian 
crisis for the families of these hostages, of the hostages 
themselves, and if we can get that resolved, and we can get a 
pause, then we have a real chance to see major progress made in 
regards to the humanitarian crisis within Gaza.
    So we recognize we all need to do more. We need to pass our 
supplemental so that you have the resources you need. We 
recognize that may not be the immediate need in Gaza, but it is 
still affecting all the other programs that you have, and you 
do not have enough resources to do your basic international and 
humanitarian assistance.
    We have to do that. The Israelis have to be more 
understanding on the gates into Gaza and to allow for the 
distribution to take place. There has got to be more effective 
international presence in order to deliver that aid, which a 
pause in hostilities will allow us to be able to get all that 
done and to bring closure in regards to the hostages that Hamas 
took on October 7 in a horrific attack on Israel.
    So I just really want to underscore the point. We are all 
concerned about getting humanitarian assistance in. We have to 
deal with that.
    But let us also concentrate on Hamas that was the--the 
terrorist attacks on October 7, the taking of hostages, which 
was outrageous to start off with, including young children and 
including women, in many cases civilians, not soldiers, and yet 
they still keep from getting home these individuals and 
allowing for closure for families on which we have had a 
deceased individual. They are responsible for their safety, and 
they are responsible for their immediate release.
    The record of the committee will remain open until end of 
the day tomorrow and the end of Thursday. We would ask that the 
members get their questions in, and we ask, Madam 
Administrator, if you would respond promptly to those 
questions.
    We started this hearing by offering our thanks for what you 
do, and we recognize you operate in an extremely challenging 
environment. Every day there is new challenges that you have to 
confront.
    I was very impressed by your comments that we direct the 
pots of dollars as to where you can spend them for about 90 
percent of the aid.
    So that makes it challenging for you to make certain 
adjustments, and we look forward to the fiscal year 2025 budget 
to give you the resources you need to meet the challenges of 
America.
    With that, if there is nothing further from my colleagues 
the hearing will be adjourned.
    Ms. Power. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Thank you all.
    [Whereupon, at 11:57 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

              Additional Material Submitted for the Record


             Responses of Ms. Samantha Power to Questions 
                Submitted by Senator Benjamin L. Cardin

                            anti-corruption
    Question. Corruption seriously disrupts the effectiveness of 
development assistance. Corrupt actors frequently redirect aid funds 
away from projects that benefit the majority of the population toward 
smaller groups of people connected to corrupt officials and aid 
intermediaries.
    Where do you think anti-corruption activities are most important 
and anti-corruption programs need enhancing, and are there certain 
sectors where corruption is more prevalent in developing countries?

    Answer. USAID agrees that corruption poses a serious threat to 
development. It undermines national security and the rule of law, 
stunts development, and saps governments of legitimacy, eroding faith 
in democracy itself. That is why tackling corruption has been elevated 
on USAID's agenda and why this Administration is prioritizing efforts 
to promote accountability for corruption around the world.
    Corruption has significantly evolved in recent decades to become a 
globalized, networked, and pernicious problem. In response, USAID has 
modernized and transformed its approach by pivoting to confront 
transnational corruption, grand corruption, and kleptocracy. USAID's 
programmatic efforts are aimed at addressing contemporary corruption 
threats, while keeping pace with the drivers, enablers, and 
manifestations of corruption today, especially transnational 
corruption. The Agency marshals a range of capabilities during pivotal 
moments for anti-corruption reform and backsliding--for which flexible 
and timely sources of funding are critical--working to preserve or 
enhance development gains, and to forge new partnerships and coalitions 
to spur and sustain anti-corruption progress. Anti-corruption 
activities are particularly impactful where there are opportunities to 
support democratic openings, stop democratic backsliding, and preserve 
or enhance development gains.
    Countering corruption across sectors that impedes development 
progress is another USAID priority. Corruption is deeply challenging in 
developing countries, particularly where there are significant 
resources and procurements involved, with substantial impacts on 
individuals, households, communities, and countries. For example:

    <bullet> In the economic growth sector, 46 percent of companies 
surveyed in 2022 experienced corruption, fraud, or other economic 
crimes in the last 2 years.

    <bullet> In the health sector, over 80 percent of people in low-
income countries have experienced corruption--at an estimated loss of 
$500 billion per year.

    <bullet> In the environment sector, corruption facilitates 
poaching, the illegal timber and fisheries trade, and wildlife 
trafficking, generating billions in illicit income every year.

    <bullet> In extractive industries, a country's national wealth is 
frequently subject to misuse and corruption, particularly as the energy 
transition creates unprecedented demand for critical minerals.

    USAID is committed to countering corruption across our development 
and humanitarian assistance efforts.

    Question. How is foreign malign influence exacerbating corruption 
in developing countries where USAID is working?

    Answer. Foreign malign actors engage in transnational corruption as 
a means to achieve their policy goals, but modalities vary by the actor 
and the targeted country. In some places, a malign actor might exploit 
weaknesses in political finance systems to fund a political party or 
movement that is tailor-made to advance their interests. Elsewhere, a 
malign actor may use kickbacks and bribes to gain control over a 
critical sector of the economy, which it can then use as a lever of 
influence against the target government. In other cases, inducements 
and other tactics are used to influence media outlets and bias the 
information a population receives. The strategic use of corruption by 
foreign malign actors is deepening the already-pervasive challenge of 
corruption in many of the environments in which USAID works.
    However, there are strategies showing promise. For example, USAID 
is supporting transparency measures that include beneficial ownership 
registries, asset disclosure regimes for public officials and 
candidates for public office, e-procurement systems, and the 
publication of contracts and the terms of loans to increase citizens' 
knowledge of the harmful impacts of transnational corruption.
    USAID is committed to continue investing in research and analysis 
to better understand the challenge posed by foreign malign actors and 
develop evidence-based strategies for countering their corrupting 
influence.
                           out-compete-china
    Question. This is the second year that the Administration has 
submitted an ``Out-Compete-China'' mandatory funding request, which 
seeks $4 billion over 5 years to support international strategic 
infrastructure projects and our efforts in the Indo-Pacific.
    Why is the ``Out-Compete-China'' mandatory funding critical for 
USAID's programming as we look toward fiscal year 2025? Can you explain 
how this funding, if authorized by this committee, is a unique effort 
to address strategic competition with China?
     What opportunities would this mandatory funding create for USAID 
to address the challenges posed by China in the Indo Pacific?

    Answer. In response to the tremendous challenges and unprecedented 
opportunities we face in the Indo-Pacific, the fiscal year 2025 
President's Budget requests both mandatory and discretionary resources 
to out-compete China, strengthen the U.S. role in the Indo-Pacific, and 
advance American prosperity globally through new investments.
    The PRC is the United States' only competitor with both the intent 
to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, 
diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it. Discretionary 
resources alone cannot meet the need as the U.S. works to out-compete 
China; it is crucial to our national security that we have mandatory, 
reliable funding.
    We have designed this mandatory package primarily as a vehicle to 
innovate new ways to support our allies and partners around the world 
by providing a viable alternative to the PRC's predatory and coercive 
practices and expanded presence and offer alternatives at a scale that 
discretionary spending simply cannot meet. The mandatory package also 
provides us the ability to make longer-term investments that complement 
and bolster our programming funded on the discretionary side.
    The mandatory proposal includes $4 billion that will enable the 
United States to invest in new ways to out-compete China and focus on 
the following new and critical investments to:

    <bullet> Create a new International Infrastructure Fund, which will 
out-compete China by providing a credible, reliable alternative to PRC 
options, while also expanding markets and opportunities for U.S. 
businesses. This fund will support transformative, quality, and 
sustainable ``hard'' infrastructure projects, including along strategic 
economic corridors.

    <bullet> Make game-changing investments in the Indo-Pacific to 
strengthen partner economies, bolster connectivity between partner 
countries, and support their efforts, including through multilateral 
fora, in pushing back against coercive actions.

    We are requesting $2 billion over 5 years to enable the United 
States to make game-changing investments in the Indo-Pacific to out-
compete China that will allow for new initiatives in strategic sectors 
that base discretionary funding alone cannot support. This funding will 
advance U.S. interests and leadership in the region and demonstrate our 
enduring commitment to our Indo-Pacific partners. We will support 
competitive connectivity in the Indo-Pacific, making Indo-Pacific 
economies more connected and resilient through transformative 
investments in emerging technologies, supply chains, and 
transportation, while also increasing opportunities for American 
businesses.
    These mandatory funds will allow us to work with our Indo-Pacific 
partners to implement a robust regional approach to secure Open Radio 
Access Network (ORAN) digital technology and other secure, high-
standards technologies that provide like-minded alternatives to the 
PRC's predatory and coercive economic practices. Additionally, this 
funding will enable the United States to coordinate strategic 
investments with like-minded partners and incentivize lasting 
commitments from host governments that advance longer-term, deeper 
cooperation in countries most at risk of coercion and predatory 
influence. Funding would be authorized and appropriated to State and 
USAID (via the Economic Support Fund), with transfer authority to other 
agencies such as DFC, EXIM, and USTDA.
    The PRC is combining its economic, diplomatic, military, and 
technological might as it pursues a sphere of influence in the Indo-
Pacific, and while its ambitions span the globe, it is most acute in 
the Indo-Pacific. In February 2022, the Biden-Harris Administration 
released a new Indo-Pacific Strategy, focused on advancing a free and 
open, connected, prosperous, secure, and resilient Indo-Pacific.
    The Indo-Pacific Strategy aims to strengthen our long-term position 
in and commitment to the region by building connections within and 
beyond the region; driving regional prosperity; bolstering regional 
security; and developing resilience to transnational threats.
    While resourcing all elements of our Indo-Pacific Strategy is an 
Administration priority, funding to advance our economic strategy in 
the region is our top resource need.
                        democracy and elections
    Question. 2024 is poised to be a consequential year for democracy, 
with more than 60 countries holding national elections.
    How will USAID--particularly through the newly established Bureau 
for Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance--promote democratic and 
transparent elections?

    Answer. USAID began preparing well in advance--as early as 2020 in 
some countries--for this pivotal year of elections. USAID is supporting 
election-related activities in 25 countries holding elections in 2024, 
involving an estimated 700 million registered voters.
    USAID's elections and political processes support in 2024 spans a 
wide range of programming, including: strengthening election management 
bodies and political parties, supporting electoral reform and election 
observation, enhancing voter education, promoting a more resilient 
information environment, mitigating electoral violence, and bolstering 
electoral justice. USAID's electoral assistance programming emphasizes 
addressing barriers to the safe and meaningful political and electoral 
participation of women, youth, and other marginalized populations.
    The newly established DRG Bureau is strategically using its 
resources to enhance and expand USAID's bilateral assistance for a 
number of crucial electoral processes in 2024 and beyond. Utilizing 
fiscal year (FY 2023) appropriated funds, USAID is providing 
approximately $57 million to Missions through rapid response mechanisms 
and direct funding aimed at enhancing the integrity of electoral 
processes, responding to unanticipated openings or electoral events, 
political transitions, and increasing women's political participation 
and leadership. This includes the following in fiscal year 2023 
resources: $27,279,000 under the Elections and Political Processes 
(EPP) Fund, $15,900,000 under the Defending Democratic Elections (DDE) 
Fund, $10,000,000 under the Advancing Women's and Girls' Civic and 
Political Leadership Initiative, as well as approximately $4,700,000 
under our Rapid and Flexible Response (RFR) capabilities under the 
Democratic Elections and Political Processes (DEPP) global mechanism, 
implemented by the Consortium for Elections and Political Processes 
(CEPPS).
    DRG is also leveraging its technical knowledge and engaging 
interagency colleagues to better link electoral assistance with 
diplomatic engagement for maximum impact.
    For example, the DRG Bureau is collaborating with the Department of 
State's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor to expand and 
update an internal U.S. Government Interagency Elections Toolkit, which 
helps Missions and Posts assess and oversee elections and political 
processes support throughout the electoral cycle. The new toolkit 
resources launched this year focus on emerging issues, including 
countering foreign electoral interference and policy tools to promote 
democratic elections.
    USAID's DRG Bureau has also recently played a key role in helping 
form and launch the Global Network for Securing Electoral Integrity 
(GNSEI), which is the first standing platform promoting coordination 
and cooperation among roughly 30 leading election integrity 
stakeholders.

    Question. How will USAID bolster support for the work of democracy 
activists, human rights defenders, and other reformers on the ground?

    Answer. Around the world, human rights defenders (HRDs), democracy 
activists, anti-corruption champions, elections observers, and other 
reformers on the ground are subject to frequent harassment, attacks, 
threats, and intimidation. USAID has a role to play in enhancing their 
protection.
    USAID has a comprehensive approach to supporting human rights 
defenders by preventing violations they face; addressing their 
physical, digital, and mental health needs; and responding to abuses 
after they occur. At the second Summit for Democracy in March 2023, 
USAID committed to enhance the security, safety, and well-being of 
implementing partners (IPs) and program participants (PPs). To 
implement this commitment, the DRG Bureau had over 200 consultations 
with Missions and with 100 HRDs and their supporters to identify best 
practices and lessons learned. DRG compiled all these best practices 
into a Risk Mitigation, Prevention, and Response Toolkit for USAID 
Missions and USAID staff to use when designing and implementing foreign 
assistance, especially in closing and closed spaces. USAID is in the 
process of finalizing this toolkit for dissemination.
    USAID/DRG offers substantial support to HRDs and other reformers 
through various initiatives including:

    <bullet> The Justice, Rights, and Security Rapid Response 
Assistance Activity (JRS-RRA) provides support to HRDs to meet urgent 
and unforeseen human rights, justice, and security-related needs and 
windows of opportunity.

    <bullet> The DRG Bureau's Human Rights Grant Program (HRGP) enables 
Missions to address emergent human rights challenges, including 
preventing and responding to human rights violations against HRDs.

    <bullet> Through the Powered by the People (PxP) activity, USAID's 
partners launched the BETA version of a Global Activist Help Desk, a 
secure, one stop shop for civic actors around the world to request a 
wide range of support including short and long-term grants, training, 
rapid response, relocation assistance, digital safety, and psychosocial 
support.

    <bullet> For at-risk journalists and media outlets, the Media 
Viability Accelerator (MVA) aims to enhance media sustainability by 
building longer term media financial viability, and includes a Flexible 
Response component designed to tackle emergencies like economic crises 
or political instability. The International Fund for Public Interest 
Media (IFPIM) supports independent journalism globally with substantial 
funding from various sources, ensuring the continuation of trustworthy 
media in hostile environments.

    <bullet> The Empowering the Truth Tellers (ETT) initiative 
strengthens investigative journalism worldwide, including by enhancing 
national mechanisms for journalist and activist protection and 
attending to investigative journalists' physical, digital, and legal 
needs.

    <bullet> In addition, a new global activity, Civic DEFENDERS, 
launching this year, will support local civil society, independent 
media, and human rights defenders to better prevent, mitigate, and 
respond to digital repression in their own contexts, particularly in 
closed and closing spaces.

    USAID provided input into the Human Rights Defender Protection Act 
of 2024 draft legislation, that you and your office are leading, by 
incorporating language on preventing attacks against HRDs, protecting 
their physical security and well-being, and responding to abuses when 
needed. We look forward to continuing conversations about what we are 
doing to protect HRDs globally.
                    localization of aid and programs
    Question. The fiscal year 2025 budget request hardly details any 
specifics on the advancement of USAID's localization of assistance 
efforts.
    How is USAID advancing localization across programs and is this 
still a priority for the Agency?
    Does localizing of assistance compromise the effectiveness (or 
outcomes) of USAID's programs?

    Answer. Localization remains one of USAID's key priorities and cuts 
across the work of all the Agency's sectors and geographies. USAID is 
planning to release its Localization Progress Report for Fiscal Year 
2023 by the end of June. The report will provide updates on USAID's 
direct local funding progress as well as lessons from the pilot of a 
new metric designed to track how USAID is elevating local leadership 
across all of its programs. Once the report is out, the Agency would be 
happy to have a conversation with your staff to discuss progress and 
priorities around this critical work moving forward.
    Over the last year, USAID has undertaken a number of efforts to 
underpin future progress on our localization goals of shifting more 
funding and decisionmaking power to local actors. These include:

    <bullet> Updating existing guidance and developing new tools and 
resources to support staff to work in more locally led ways, including 
through teams like Local Works, the New Partnerships Initiative, and 
localization working groups formed across all Agency bureaus and 
missions.

    <bullet> Developing new and updating existing policies and 
associated tools to bring greater coherence to why and how to invest in 
the Agency's local partners. For example, USAID's Local Capacity 
Strengthening Policy has both set a new standard for approaching local 
capacity strengthening among our OECD-DAC partners, but it is also 
being recognized for how USAID policies should be created in the first 
place--with strong consultations among our local partners.

    <bullet> Reducing barriers to entry for local partners through 
increased outreach, expanded use of local languages, more flexible and 
tailorable pre-award assessments for local partners, and more.

    <bullet> Focusing on partnering better, such as by expanding the 
use of mechanisms with fewer compliance burdens, taking steps to 
support partners' full cost recovery, and encouraging staff to reduce 
reporting burdens.

    There is considerable agreement among those who work in 
development, as well as some academic literature (e.g., Honig 2018, 
Campbell 2018, Andrews et al, 2015, USAID 2022) that suggests that the 
incorporation of local priorities, local knowledge, and local 
accountability and feedback structures is a key contributor to more 
effective and successful programs. Studies of individual projects that 
look specifically at issues around ownership also often bear this out.
    There are a range of approaches that can advance locally led 
development. To the extent that the question posed is about the 
approach of funding local partners directly, evidence does not suggest 
that direct local funding compromises USAID's effectiveness. For 
example, a study comparing international and local partners' delivery 
of PEPFAR programs in fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2020 found that 
while programs by local partners exceeded some targets and performed 
somewhat less well than international partners on other targets, the 
overall quality of service delivery was comparable between local and 
international partners.
    USAID's Mission in Serbia also recently conducted an evaluation 
examining the development benefits of working through local partners. 
They highlight contextual knowledge, relationships and connections, 
high motivation, and sustained engagement in the local system even 
after the award ends as key values of direct local partnerships. 
Indeed, when we articulate that the outcomes of interest are not just 
sectoral indicators but investment in local systems, the calculus for 
more engagement of local partners becomes even stronger.
    That said, funding a local partner directly may not always enable 
sustainable outcomes and development. Context matters enormously, which 
is why USAID defers to Missions to set their own targets for local 
partnerships, bearing in mind factors like the operating environments 
for local organizations (i.e., civic space), the capacity and appetite 
of local organizations to manage U.S. Government funding, Mission 
capacity, and a range of other contextual factors. This is also why 
USAID frames its localization goals not just around direct local 
funding, but also around the many ways we can structure our work to 
elevate local voices regardless of the type of implementing partner.
                         climate and the budget
    Question. U.S. leadership on climate action is essential to solving 
the climate crisis and meeting the universal goal of keeping global 
temperatures from increasing by 1.5 degrees Celsius.
    Please explain how USAID accounts for spending on climate programs 
and how you may delineate budget items that have a reasonable climate 
action component, but not exclusively or directly serve efforts to 
combat or adapt to the effects of climate change?

    Answer. The U.S. Government (USG) international climate assistance 
funding falls in two categories:

    <bullet> ``Direct'' climate investments through activities 
supported by funds allocated specifically for one of the three pillars 
of our climate change assistance funding: Adaptation, Clean Energy, and 
Sustainable Landscapes.

    <bullet> ``Indirect'' climate investments through activities 
supported by funds allocated for other primary purposes, and which 
deliver climate benefits. For example, a program that helps farmers who 
are vulnerable to climate change access and use drought-tolerant seeds 
would be categorized primarily as a direct food security activity, and 
as an indirect climate activity, as the secondary benefits are 
attributable to USAID's climate adaptation objectives.

    The President's fiscal year 2025 request includes $3 billion total 
for direct and indirect climate programs. The Department of State and 
USAID request direct climate adaptation, clean energy and sustainable 
landscapes funding as well as the planned scope of indirect adaptation, 
clean energy, and sustainable landscapes programming that complement 
the other sectoral funding requests. The direct climate programs 
request of $1.36 billion is balanced along with other Administration 
priorities and represents programs whose first objective is to achieve 
climate adaptation, clean energy, and sustainable landscapes outcomes. 
The indirect climate request of $1.67 billion is aligned with 
Administration priorities and is built into the President's fiscal year 
2025 request. These Mission requests are reviewed by Washington 
stakeholders, including USAID and the Department of State, and 
represent attributable, secondary climate objectives complementing the 
primary objectives of other USG foreign assistance programs.
                      regional migrant integration
    Question. More than 500,000 people crossed the dangerous Darien 
jungle region between Colombia and Panama in 2023, and early estimates 
showing an increase to more than 700,000 in 2024, our assistance and 
partnerships in the region.
    Where can you demonstrate that increasing our investments in legal 
pathways and supporting migrants to integrate across the Hemisphere 
bring tangible results that can stem irregular migration flows to 
reduce pressure at the U.S. border?
    What are the risks of not expanding this aspect of USAID's work?

    Answer. There is some preliminary evidence that investing in legal 
labor pathways and helping migrants integrate across the hemisphere may 
reduce the need for irregular migration. For example, a 2023 study \1\ 
comparing communities in Guatemala found that when more temporary 
worker visas are available, more individuals take advantage of those 
legal pathways rather than migrating irregularly. \2\ In addition, the 
study found that families of regular migrants have a better general 
economic situation--lower levels of poverty and food insecurity, access 
to diverse food, among other development outcomes--and that more 
frequent and larger remittances sent by regular migrants are channeled 
into investments that improve quality of life and generate income and 
development in the migrants' communities of origin over the long term.

94360e592b93/Impact-of-regular-temporary-migration-to-Canada-and-the-
U.S.-FINAL-INFORM-2023.pdf
    \2\ Specifically, the percentage of households with irregular 
migrants in communities with greater access to temporary worker visas 
was 19 percentage points lower than communities with fewer temporary 
worker visas: 11 percent of households in communities with more 
temporary worker visas compared to about 30 percent in communities with 
fewer temporary worker visas.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Helping regularize and integrate migrants across the countries 
where we work in the Western Hemisphere is another critical element of 
the USAID approach to addressing migration. Research confirms that 
regularized migrants are less vulnerable to exploitation due to their 
ability to seek help or access services that are designed to protect 
them. And when migrants have legal status, they can access jobs, 
schools and education programming where they are, reducing their need 
to move elsewhere to meet their needs. Further, according to an April 
2024 UNHCR report, just 19 percent of migrants surveyed transiting the 
Darien between January and March reported having valid documentation in 
another country.
    The risks of not expanding this work include the potential that 
more migrants may opt to go to the U.S. irregularly. Additionally, not 
expanding this work may also increase the vulnerability and possible 
onward migration of the 9.8 million migrants in the region who are 
already forcibly displaced outside of their home country and who would 
potentially see their access to services and legal protection 
inhibited.

             Responses of Ms. Samantha Power to Questions 
                  Submitted by Senator James E. Risch

                      presence and risk management
    Question. Do you believe that the Agency's current risk tolerance 
in medium- to-high-threat posts is appropriately tailored? Do you 
believe that it should be improved, and if so, how? What will you do to 
bring about that improvement?

    Answer. The Agency's core mission and role in support of U.S. 
foreign policy and national security objectives requires that USAID 
work in a wide variety of fragile, non-permissive environments (NPEs). 
Risks range from state failure, armed conflict, and other types of 
violent instability due to corruption, susceptibility to natural 
disaster, and political or macroeconomic disruptions, with many country 
contexts vulnerable to multiple risks at the same time.
    Through USAID's Enterprise Risk Management Framework, USAID 
considers these risks as part of an interrelated portfolio and applies 
the Agency's Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) which provides broad based 
guidance on the level and type of risk the Agency is willing to 
accept--based on an evaluation of opportunities and threats--to achieve 
the Agency's mission and objectives.
    In 2022, USAID conducted a full review and revision of our Risk 
Appetite Statement (RAS) to ensure alignment with the Agency's 
organizational priorities and operating context, including in medium- 
to-high-threat posts. The revised document outlines eight different 
risk categories: Programmatic/Development Outcome, Fiduciary, 
Reputational, Legal, Security, Human Capital, Information Technology 
and Operational (each with their own varying appetite of high, medium, 
and low).
    The RAS also defined the difference between risk appetite and risk 
tolerance for the workforce. While risk appetite provides a higher 
Agency-level statement on the levels of risk USAID deems allowable, 
risk tolerance is the acceptable level of variance from the risk 
appetite in performance relative to the achievement of objectives, 
which can be set at a project/activity level. This means the risk 
tolerance at the project/activity level in medium- to-high-threat posts 
can be appropriately tailorable to each context.
    With regard to maintaining presence in Non-Permissive Environments 
(NPEs), USAID has a Medium risk appetite. USAID maintains Missions, 
field offices, and temporary duty presence in conflict, post-conflict, 
natural disaster, health emergency, or other insecure and/or high risk 
environments. In these instances, USAID balances the likelihood for 
security breaches and/or need to suddenly evacuate staff or allocate 
additional security resources with the NPE's impact on U.S. foreign 
policy and national security objectives. In addition, USAID facilitates 
mission critical travel in line with the U.S. Government guidelines on 
health, safety, and security to address major overseas disruption in 
Agency operations.
    USAID operates with as much transparency as possible, while 
balancing the imperative to protect workforce members, contractors, 
partners, and beneficiaries who could face significant risks from 
association with the United States. USAID supports workforce members 
undertaking field visits coordinated and approved in accordance with 
post management policies and by Regional Security Officers (RSOs) for 
the purposes of: designing programs, monitoring implementation, or 
providing oversight, among other mission critical purposes. However, 
USAID harmonizes this desire with the discretion of the RSO, the 
likelihood of security incidents, and the availability of effective 
alternatives, including those that deploy technologies which reduce 
risks (e.g., virtual site visits).
    USAID also has a Medium risk appetite with respect to support for 
USAID staff at hardship posts and in other difficult operating 
environments. USAID staff can be assigned to hardship posts with 
difficult operating environments to carry out the Agency's mission. 
Staff in these situations must continually balance these assignments 
with the potential for severe and unsustainable levels of stress that 
might arise from exposure to threats, unprecedented workloads, 
separations from family, and inadequate rest. To address these 
challenges, USAID has expanded Employee Assistance Program (EAP) 
services, particularly for those serving in high threat and/or high 
stress, complex environments. EAP services provide enhanced tools, 
knowledge, skills, and resources (with slight variations across hiring 
mechanisms in the level of services available) to help staff and their 
families increase stress awareness, develop resilience skills, stay 
healthy, and continue supporting the USAID mission. Additionally, in 
the event of major disruptions in overseas Agency operations, our first 
priority is the safety and wellbeing of USAID staff while ensuring 
adequate staffing at post to fulfill the Agency's mission.
    USAID employs a variety of risk mitigation measures to counter the 
risk of diversion as standard practice when making awards to 
organizations implementing programs and can employ heightened risk 
mitigation in the form of partner vetting when appropriate.
    (SBU) To assist staff in identifying the inherent security risk 
exposure associated with the operating context of a specific country, 
the Office of Security (SEC) has developed a Country Threat Matrix 
which scores the criticality of terrorist presence. This resource is 
used in conjunction with the Risk Based Assessment (RBA) process to 
reduce the likelihood of interference from sanctioned groups and 
mitigate the risk of diversion of resources.
    The Center for Conflict and Violence Prevention (CVP), located in 
USAID's Bureau for Conflict Prevention and Stabilization (CPS), helps 
USAID Missions and staff overseas to design and deliver state-of-the 
art conflict mitigation, violence prevention, and peacebuilding 
interventions. The Office of Civilian-Military Cooperation (CMC) is 
also part of the CPS and serves as USAID's primary point of contact 
with the Department of Defense (DOD). The CMC also responds to the 
National Security Strategy demand that development be a strong and 
equal partner with diplomacy and defense in the collective pursuit of a 
world that promotes peace, security and opportunity for all.
    At the Assessable Unit (AU) level, USAID bureaus and missions 
providing assistance overseas have controls to prevent and detect 
fiduciary, counterterrorism- or sanctions-related, and security issues. 
In parallel, the ERM function also identifies and mitigates potential 
risks that may be associated with delivering aid related to a program 
or activity. Despite these inherent risks, USAID meets this challenge 
by using a variety of risk management techniques because the U.S. 
Government has determined that the risk of inaction, or inadequate 
action, outweighs the risk of providing assistance.
    In conclusion, the Agency has a strong commitment to assisting 
those in conflict-prone states and works through its various bureaus 
and missions to determine the best course of action in each situation. 
The current RAS enables Operating Units to assess risks associated with 
the various components of their operating context, and tailor their 
approach to risk management to both mitigate risk and capitalize on 
opportunities with informed decisionmaking, aligned with U.S. foreign 
policy objectives and the specific needs of the communities in conflict 
zones.

    Question. What lessons has USAID learned from its evacuations from 
Afghanistan, Ukraine, and Sudan that may be applied in future 
circumstances in which security conditions rapidly deteriorate, 
particularly with regard to: early warning; staff evacuations, care and 
support (including locally engaged staff and American Implementing 
Partners); and remote monitoring to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse?

    Answer. USAID is committed to taking steps to improve the 
evacuation process to keep our workforce and Implementing Partners safe 
and strengthen our operational readiness posture globally. This work is 
coordinated through the Critical Coordination Structure in our Bureau 
for Management which provides technical support for Mission readiness 
planning, oversees the development of Mission Continuity Plans, and 
evaluates Bureau and Mission readiness. More broadly, the Department of 
State leads the relevant Emergency Action Committee at each post and 
oversees all evacuations of American personnel, including USAID staff.
    The following are specific examples of how USAID responds to 
emerging crises and applicable lessons from such events, as well as 
ways USAID is adapting our approach for when future circumstances may 
necessitate an evacuation.
                     early warning and preparedness
    <bullet> In high threat posts, USAID has established or is 
establishing Partner Liaison Security Officers to coordinate with and 
support Implementing Partners through steady state and crisis events.

    <bullet> Mission leaders are encouraged to advocate for specific 
Locally Employed Staff security requirements to be discussed and 
included as part of the Emergency Action Committee and continuity of 
operations.

    <bullet> USAID's Command Center and Critical Coordination Structure 
(CCS) are constantly monitoring world events and U.S. Government 
reporting/cables to scenario plan and determine when to facilitate the 
coordination of key crisis support teams in Washington to respond to 
various crises. These pre-planning calls include key Washington 
stakeholders, as well as Mission leadership, and have been invaluable 
in some of the aforementioned country contexts.

    <bullet> USAID continues to provide specialized personnel recovery 
and preparedness training to staff at high-risk missions that includes 
locally employed staff.
                           staff evacuations
    <bullet> In high threat posts, USAID is increasing preparedness 
requirements, testing, and exercises to include periodic Mission 
assessments, specific evacuation training, enhanced contingency 
planning including surge staff support, and standardization of 
administrative processes (e.g., travel authorizations and vouchering).

    <bullet> USAID continues to increase engagement and socialization 
of operational readiness with USAID specific requirements via readiness 
resources, products, and services to include Mission Continuity Plans, 
tabletop exercises, and emergency preparedness training to build a 
strong culture of readiness.

    <bullet> USAID developed guidance for extraordinary duties and 
responsibilities staff must perform during evacuations to minimize 
disruption and complete actions in rapid timeframes (e.g., records 
destruction).

    <bullet> Staff at Posts are regularly engaged in accountability 
drills to improve the consolidation process and ensure crisis 
communications channels are functional.

    <bullet> USAID leaders and Mission leaders are encouraged to set 
transparent expectations around evacuation processes to manage the 
disruptive impacts on the workforce.
             care and support--locally employed (le) staff
    <bullet> USAID is updating its Readiness Playbook for LE staff to 
expand and clearly communicate the preparedness and crisis management 
guidance issued in the Agency's internal operational policy.

    <bullet> USAID is developing clear policy and guidance for LE staff 
on the support, special considerations, and potential financial offsets 
that can be provided during a crisis.

    <bullet> Missions are fostering a culture of readiness at the 
community level by developing warden systems, skills banks, go bag or 
emergency kits, and other preparedness activities for LE staff.

    <bullet> USAID's Staff Care has available culturally responsive 
psychosocial and emotional support services for LE staff to address 
mental health and promote staff welfare.

    <bullet> USAID is developing standard operating procedures and 
agreements so Missions can establish in advance which neighboring 
Missions can assist them during a crisis with surge support or be an 
alternate location to establish interim operations should evacuation 
from post occur.
              care and support--u.s. implementing partners
    Although the duty of care for Implementing Partners is beyond 
USAID's legal purview, the Agency is committed to ensuring Implementing 
Partners can safely operate in disruptive environments and are provided 
flexibilities to operate in alternate modalities based on country 
context:

    <bullet> USAID's Partner Liaison Security Officers liaise, 
communicate, and support Implementing Partners through steady state and 
crisis events.

    <bullet> USAID is examining Agency policy based on past evacuations 
to develop a matrix of options for authorizing evacuation costs and 
allowances for Implementing Partners that aligns with USAID's fiduciary 
risk posture.

    <bullet> USAID is ensuring all new acquisition and assistance 
awards include language on safety and security plans that addresses 
crises. For existing awards, USAID is working with the chiefs of party 
on known flexibilities or crisis modifiers.

    <bullet> USAID's Office of Acquisition and Assistance has prepared 
a Crisis Playbook to enhance operational readiness. This guide 
consolidates lessons learned and transforms them into practical 
recommendations for Contracting and Agreement Officers (COs/AOs) and 
Washington leadership. It serves as a reference guide for preparing for 
and responding to an emergency or evacuation. This playbook 
consolidates long-term planning and award management recommendations as 
well as considerations and messaging for effective coordination with 
implementing partners.
                           remote monitoring
    The fluidity of evacuations and removal of staff from post require 
adaptive protocols to manage USG resources and taxpayer dollars:

    <bullet> USAID is developing protocols under two workstreams during 
evacuation: (1) the first with a focus on operations and the safety and 
security of the workforce; and (2) a separate workstream for 
programming oversight, monitoring, and program pivots.

    <bullet> USAID's efforts to build monitoring capacity of trusted 
local partners and interlocutors enables alternative oversight and 
information in the case of evacuated personnel and program staff.

    Question. With at least 22 different hiring mechanisms and outdated 
assumptions about how specific missions, bureaus, and offices should be 
supported, the agency is in desperate need of a modernized strategic 
staffing plan that is flexible and adaptive to today's challenges.
    When will I finally see USAID's comprehensive strategic staffing 
plan that aligns positions, skills, and resources across the agency, 
transparently and effectively streamlines hiring mechanisms, and 
reduces reliance upon program funds, costly institutional contracts, 
and Participating Agency Service Agreements (PASAs) to meet modern 
staffing needs?

    Answer. Given the complexities you noted, we are addressing this 
through several significant efforts:
                  strategic workforce planning reform
    The Workforce Planning and Program (WPP) Division in the Office of 
Human Capital and Talent Management (HCTM) has been working steadily 
and systematically to implement a realistic, practical, and sustainable 
approach to workforce planning at USAID. As of April 2024, the Agency 
is on track to have in place a new policy, i.e. ADS, on workforce 
planning to establish the process for an ongoing, annual workforce 
planning cycle. Understanding that workforce planning is a shared 
responsibility between senior leaders, each operating unit, and HCTM, 
USAID has built a stakeholder-supported approach that actively engages 
all involved in an ongoing process to align the workforce, human 
capital management strategies, and budget to cost-effectively advance 
USAID's development and humanitarian assistance policy and programming 
priorities.
    This work has included:

    <bullet> Developing, piloting, and using workforce data and 
analysis to provide insight into the current workforce and to provide 
workforce data for decisionmaking.

    <bullet> Engaging senior leadership in developing the workforce 
planning approach and their role in setting strategic direction to 
obtaining buy-in and support for a more holistic and collaborative 
workforce planning approach

    <bullet> Developing a workforce planning governance structure, 
policy, procedures, and guidance; using senior leader direction, 
stakeholder input, and lessons learned from pilot projects has resulted 
in a more realistic, practical, and sustainable approach

    In early 2024, USAID established the first-ever Agency Strategic 
Workforce Planning (SWFP) Council as an advisory board to set strategic 
direction, strengthen workforce planning at every level, and 
institutionalize workforce planning governance, policy, procedures and 
guidance. The SWFP Council is chaired by the Deputy Administrator for 
Management and Resources with Assistant Administrator-level 
representation from each Bureau and Independent Office.
    The SWFP Council will contribute to developing a new Strategic 
Workforce Plan in 2024. This Strategic Workforce Plan will align 
positions, skills, and resources across the agency, with most (if not 
all) of the following elements:

    <bullet> Direct hire position levels by FS and CS

    <bullet> Region and B/IO of those staff

    <bullet> Major workforce drivers

    <bullet> Overseas presence

    <bullet> Future look for next 3 years

    <bullet> Current overseas gaps

    <bullet> Changes to criteria to determine overseas presence and 
assignments

    <bullet> Diversity initiatives
                     skills and competencies reform
    Through the Skills and Competencies Reform initiative USAID is 
transforming the way we capture and utilize skills data across all 
talent management processes. This effort will enable the Agency to 
associate skills with direct hire and Personal Services Contractor 
(PSC) positions throughout the organization. By keeping skills data 
current on positions, the Agency's employees, supervisors, leaders of 
Missions, Bureaus and Independent Offices (B/IOs) will have up-to-date 
information about the skills needed for specific roles across USAID. 
This initiative will enable us to understand USAID's supply and demand 
of skills, and therefore improve alignment of workforce planning 
strategies, optimize the assignments process, focus upskilling and 
recruiting efforts, and give more precise guidance to the workforce 
regarding learning and development.
    We have finalized a pilot of skills tagging by supervisors and 
employees, with the goal of having a comprehensive view of the skills 
makeup of our workforce and of the skills needed in the organization in 
late 2024. After that collection, USAID will use the insights gained to 
influence all aspects of the employment lifecycle, including career 
path development, recruitment, and training. This holistic approach 
will allow for data-driven decisionmaking, targeted learning 
opportunities, and strategic talent allocation based on organizational 
needs.
                         workforce composition
    Our current workforce composition stems directly from a bifurcation 
of our appropriations, with the requirement that our career Federal 
employees be solely funded with Operating Expenses (OE) funds. While we 
recognize that there are budgetary dynamics at play, in the past 4 
years, our programming has grown by nearly 70 percent--but our 
operating expenses have increased at half that rate. As a result, our 
global workforce of over 13,000 staff includes approximately 30 percent 
direct hire Federal employees and 70 percent contracted staff spanning 
an array of staffing mechanisms: Civil Service (CS), Foreign Service 
(FS), Civil Service Excepted (CSE), Foreign Service Limited (FSL), U.S. 
Personal Services Contractor (USPSC), Third-Country National PSC 
(TCNPSC), Cooperating Country National PSC (CCNPSC) also referred to as 
Foreign Service Nationals (FSN), FSN Direct Hire, and Institutional 
Support Contractor (ISC), as well as fellows, interns, and other short-
term staffing mechanisms.
    The Agency is maximizing its use of available resources and 
authorities to make progress toward effectively streamlining our hiring 
mechanisms. For instance, we have used small increases in OE funds in 
fiscal year (FY) 2022 and fiscal year 2023 to add nearly 300 new career 
positions and created nearly 600 non-career Federal employee positions 
using program accounts authorized by Congress for that purpose. Of 
these 900 total new Federal employee positions, approximately 400 
replace positions that were previously designated as contractors, 
helping grow the proportion of our direct-hire Federal employee 
workforce.
                       crisis operations staffing
    Congress included language in the fiscal year 2023 Omnibus 
Appropriations bill that allows USAID to use program funds for a civil 
service excepted (CSE) mechanism for Crisis Operations Staffing (COS). 
The $86 million appropriated will fund between 300 and 350 positions--
including salaries, benefits and other direct costs to support the 
Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance (BHA), Bureau for Global Health (GH), 
and the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) in the Bureau for 
Conflict Prevention and Stabilization (CPS). The initial pilot 
positions are intended to replace existing program-funded contract and 
interagency agreement positions in these three bureau/offices. With 
this authority, we can use existing program funds that we would have 
used for Personal Service and other contractors to hire time-limited, 
US-based staff in the Federal excepted service, to manage crisis 
operations. This is not a permanent authorization and so USAID needs to 
request this authority every year in appropriations.
    Since we received the OPM authority last spring, we have hired over 
100 positions: 71 in OTI, 18 in Global Health, and 17 in BHA. Through 
COS, OTI has been able to hire back 81 percent of its qualified PSC 
staff in non-contract positions. The government benefits have also 
attracted more people from across the country to fill vacancies. We 
have received over 30,000 applications for jobs in BHA, GH and OTI. 
Many individuals would not have applied to the PSC jobs because of 
fewer benefits (e.g., no retirement contributions, no group life 
insurance, and limited health insurance options).

    Question. Will the request for authority to hire under the Personal 
Service Agreement (PSA) mechanism result in a reduction of Personal 
Services Contractors (PSCs)? If not, why not?

    Answer. The use of the PSA mechanism is anticipated to result in a 
significant reduction of Cooperating Country National (CCN) Personal 
Service Contractors (PSCs) overseas. The PSA mechanism will be piloted 
in select countries beginning in September 2024. After the pilots are 
completed and evaluated, USAID anticipates rolling out the PSA 
mechanism worldwide over the next 18-24 months.

    Question. If authorized, will PSA authority be applied exclusively 
overseas? Are all Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs) expected to be 
converted from PSC to PSA? If not, where will PSA positions be 
prioritized?

    Answer. If further authorized, USAID anticipates many Cooperating 
Country National (CCN) PSC positions will be converted from PSC to PSA 
over the next 24 months. USAID will pilot the PSA mechanism in select 
countries beginning in September 2024. After the pilot is completed, 
USAID anticipates rolling out the PSA mechanism on a broader basis 
starting in the next 18-24 months applying lessons learned from the 
pilots.
    USAID has a limited number of Foreign Service Nationals that are 
employed as direct-hires. FSNs that are non-U.S. citizen direct-hire 
employees are appointed under the authority of the Foreign Service Act 
of 1980, as amended. Current FSN direct-hires remain in this status 
until they leave the Agency or retire.
    The current authorizing statute is applicable to individuals who 
are providing ``services abroad''; thus, the rollout of the PSA 
authority is limited to overseas positions.

    Question. To date, USAID has exercised dangerously poor oversight 
of its partners engaged in research of pathogens of pandemic potential.
    What safeguards have you put in place to ensure that the resources 
in the fiscal year 2025 budget request, as well as prior-year funding 
that has yet to be obligated, are not directed toward partners that 
have demonstrated poor compliance with U.S. requirements relating to 
research of dual-use concern, data quality, data sharing, performance 
standards, and fiscal controls?

    Answer. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, USAID--and the U.S. 
Government as a whole--has assessed its priorities and approach to 
pandemic preparedness. This includes aligning resources to achieve the 
commitments within the National Biodefense Strategy, weighing the 
relative risks and impact of our programming (including biosafety and 
biosecurity capacity), as well as determining how to optimally allocate 
global health security resources.
    Based on this prioritization and informed by ongoing engagement 
with key stakeholders, in 2023 USAID determined that investments that 
focus on the search for and characterization of unknown viruses, prior 
to spillover to humans, do not effectuate USAID's current global health 
security program priorities. USAID has issued guidance to GHS programs 
worldwide to communicate this decision.
    Further, USAID does not fund dual-use research of concern (DURC) or 
gain of function research, and no fiscal year 2025 funds will be used 
for DURC or gain of function research.
    In addition, prior to making any assistance award, USAID conducts a 
risk assessment in accordance with ADS 303.3.9, Pre-Award Risk 
Assessment, which includes a review of the applicant's history of 
performance. Typically, this is accomplished through past performance 
references provided by AOR/CORs of previous government projects.
    USG policies, processes, and guidelines on biodefense, health 
security, laboratory biosafety/security, and non-proliferation 
objectives inform USAID decisions on funding/support in other 
countries.

    Question. Does EcoHealth Alliance continue to receive funding from 
USAID for any purpose, whether as a prime, sub-, or sub-sub awardee? If 
so, where and for what purposes?

    Answer. On May 15, 2024, the United States Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS) suspended and proposed the debarment of EcoHealth 
Alliance from participating in United States Federal Government 
procurement and nonprocurement programs. Following this action, USAID 
has taken the necessary steps to terminate the Agency's only active 
award with EcoHealth Alliance--a conservation program in Liberia titled 
Conservation Works. The activity supported biodiversity and 
conservation efforts in Liberia by establishing and improving the 
management of protected areas and supporting ecotourism and income 
generation.
    USAID has notified EHA that the Agency unilaterally terminated the 
USAID/Liberia award with EcoHealth Alliance with an end date of August 
15, 2024 and directed EHA to commence closeout procedures immediately. 
Since the suspension, USAID has not obligated any additional funding to 
EcoHealth Alliance.

    Question. Does the term ``sexual and reproductive health'', as it 
relates to USAID assistance, programs, and engagement in development 
forums, include access to ``safe and legal'' abortion?

    Answer. USAID does not fund abortions. The Agency takes statutory 
restrictions related to abortion seriously and works to ensure 
compliance with all applicable laws, including the Helms and Siljander 
amendments.

    Question. Can you confirm that all USAID grants and contracts, 
including all subgrants and subcontracts, that provide for the 
utilization of U.S. foreign assistance resources, regardless of account 
and regardless of targeted health sector, include specific prohibitions 
on the use of funds to perform or promote abortion, or lobby for or 
against the legalization of abortion overseas?

    Answer. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, and USAID's 
annual appropriations acts set forth a number of statutory restrictions 
related to abortion, including the Helms, Leahy, Siljander and Biden 
Amendments. These restrictions apply to all U.S. foreign assistance 
funds, including through subawards and subcontracts, across all sectors 
and partners, and have been in place for a number of decades. USAID 
implements the restrictions related to abortion through mandatory 
standard provisions and contract clauses included in our grants and 
contracts.

    Question. Can you confirm the same for all USAID grants and 
contracts, including all subgrants and subcontracts, that provide for 
the utilization of U.S. foreign assistance resources, regardless of 
account, to promote human rights and gender equality?

    Answer. Yes.

    Question. Is access to ``safe and legal'' abortion included among 
the health, human rights, and/or gender equality initiatives that USAID 
seeks to advance through utilization of U.S. foreign assistance 
funding?

    Answer. USAID does not fund abortions. The Agency takes statutory 
restrictions related to abortion seriously and works to ensure 
compliance with all applicable laws, including the Helms and Siljander 
amendments.

    Question. What reforms are you seeking to through the Farm Bill 
process, in order to make U.S. food aid more efficient and effective? 
Please be specific.

    Answer. USAID continues to be grateful for Congress' commitment to 
combating global hunger, including by ensuring that the Food for Peace 
Act remains fit-for-purpose to address current humanitarian challenges. 
During this Farm Bill reauthorization process, USAID is proposing 
technical changes to the Food for Peace Act to make U.S. food aid more 
efficient and effective.
    First, USAID is proposing to increase the efficiency of both 
emergency and non-emergency food assistance programs by shifting some 
U.S. commodities from Title II non-emergency programs to emergency 
programs. This change would maintain the same level of commodity 
procurements from U.S. producers while offering implementing partners 
more choice in designing non-emergency programs to address the root 
causes of hunger.
    Additionally, current law requires our partners to use commodities 
in non-emergency food assistance programs even when other forms of 
assistance would be more effective or appropriate. Giving partners more 
choice in programming would improve the outcomes of these programs and 
help decrease reliance on U.S. assistance in the long term. For 
example, partners can address chronic food consumption gaps caused by a 
lack of agricultural productivity in communities by providing training 
and tools to farmers.
    USAID is also proposing that Congress consolidate the complex 
accounting requirements within the Food for Peace Act. Current law not 
only requires that USAID partners assign costs to specific categories, 
but also requires USAID staff to track and validate expenditures on a 
real-time aggregate basis to stay within specific statutory earmarks, 
on top of determining that costs are allowable as reasonable and 
necessary expenses on an award-by-award basis, as is done for most US 
Government expenditures. Determining how each cost should be 
categorized, or how costs should be divided across categories for the 
current, complex accounting process is a massive burden on our staff 
and partners, often requiring custom-built accounting systems. We 
estimate that streamlining cost categories could save USAID more than 
1,600 staff hours per year. This change would make Title II operate 
more similarly to other accounts administered by USAID, such as 
International Disaster Assistance, which do not have cost categories.
    Under current law, one USAID partner estimated that the cost of 
administering this system for their organization is about $1.3 million 
per year per nonemergency program. Streamlining the cost categories 
would reduce these administrative costs, translating to up to 20,000 
additional people receiving food assistance each year or up to 10,000 
additional people benefiting from livelihood activities like seeds, 
livestock feed, or other inputs.

    Question. What are the current cost differentials between USAID's 
existing food aid modalities, including: (1) food aid provided in the 
form of ``market-based assistance,'' such as biometrically verified 
electronic transfers and vouchers; (2) food aid commodities procured 
locally or regionally; and (3) food aid commodities procured and 
shipped from the United States?

    Answer. Decisions on modality are largely driven by context to 
achieve the best efficiency and effectiveness of program options. Costs 
vary by the country, the size of the food basket/ration being targeted, 
the partner, and market conditions at the time of purchase. The Bureau 
for Humanitarian Assistance country teams include cost analysis in the 
decisionmaking process. A number of local factors affect cost-
efficiency at the response level. As an example, in South Sudan, to 
meet half of a person's caloric needs for 1 month through the World 
Food Program would cost $18.26 using market-based transfers, $14.22 
using locally procured sorghum, and $18.29 using Title II commodities 
as of November 2023. In this example, there is a particularly expensive 
environment for market-based transfers due to the low capacity of the 
banking system. Additionally, the in-kind options in this example use 
very large purchases due to the high number of beneficiaries, taking 
advantage of some economies of scale.
    Other examples include:

    <bullet> In Niger, a basket to meet 65 percent of a person's 
caloric needs for a month cost $21.97 for Title II, $13.09 for Local, 
Regional, and International Procurement (LRIP), and $7.98 for market 
based transfers in November 2023.

    <bullet> In Madagascar, in March 2024, to meet 50 percent of a 
person's caloric needs for a month cost $12.05 with Title II, $12.23 
with LRIP, and $7.94 using cash transfers.

    <bullet> In Burkina Faso, costs are very high due to the air 
operation into the north and the transitional authorities not allowing 
the use of cash or vouchers, but to meet 100 percent of a person's 
caloric needs for a month cost $64.06 using Title II and $63.53 using 
LRIP in January 2024.

    <bullet> In Somalia, in April 2024, to provide 80 percent of a 
person's caloric needs for a month cost $25.35 for Title II and $17.52 
for either market-based transfers or food vouchers.

    Question. What is the current cost differential between U.S.-
flagged and foreign-flagged ocean transport vessels carrying U.S. food 
aid commodities overseas?

    Answer. In fiscal year 2023, the average freight cost per metric 
ton (MT) for a US flagged vessel was $170.53/MT for bulk vessels and 
$255.81/MT for liner vessels ($196.19/MT cumulatively). In contrast, 
the average cost per MT for foreign flagged vessels was $70.34/MT for 
bulk vessels and $176.71/MT for liner vessels ($88.81/MT cumulatively). 
US flagged vessels were, on average, 142 percent more costly than 
foreign flagged vessels for bulk vessels and 45 percent more costly for 
liner vessels (121 percent cumulatively).

    Question. To your knowledge, how many U.S.-flagged ocean transport 
vessels carrying U.S. food aid overseas remain in the U.S. commercial 
fleet? By whom are they owned?

    Answer. There are currently only four U.S.-flagged dry bulk vessels 
eligible to participate in the food aid program: Liberty Grace, Liberty 
Glory, Liberty Eagle, and Schuyler Line Navigation Company's (SLNC) 
Severn. The three Liberty vessels are owned by the Liberty Maritime 
Corporation. The SLNC Severn is owned by Oldendorff Carriers GMBH co.
    For non-bulk vessels, the following 13 U.S.-flagged vessels 
transported U.S. food aid in fiscal year (FY) 2023 and fiscal year 2024 
to April: Maersk Atlanta, Maersk Chicago, Maersk Columbus, Maersk 
Denver, Maersk Detroit, Maersk Hartford, Maersk Idaho, Maersk 
Kensington, Maersk Kinloss, Maersk Pittsburgh, Missouri Express, 
National Glory, and President Wilson. The Maersk vessels are owned by 
Maersk Line Ltd, Missouri Express is owned by Hapag-Lloyd AG, National 
Glory is owned by National Shipping of America NSA, and President 
Wilson is owned by APL/CMA.

    Question. In fiscal year 2023, how many Ocean Transportation 
Requests for Proposal (RFPs) were issued by USAID? fiscal year 2024, to 
date?
    Of those RFPs, how many received bids from more than one U.S.-
flagged carrier? How many received no bids from U.S.-flagged carriers?

    Answer. Requests for Proposal (RFP) are defined as individual 
freight solicitations issued by USAID. There are multiple parcels to 
several destinations on an individual RFP.
    1. RFPs issued
    FY 2023. Packaged RFPs: 17. Bulk RFPs: 11.
    FY 2024 to date (as of end of April 2024). Packaged RFPs: 8. Bulk 
RFPs: 5.

    2. RFPs receiving more than one U.S. flag offer
    Identifies the number of RFPs where two or more U.S. flag (P1) 
offers were received on a single parcel. Other parcels within the same 
RFP may have received only one or zero U.S. flag offers.
    FY2023. Packaged: 1. Bulk: 3.
    FY 2024 to date (as of end of April 2024). Packaged: 0. Bulk: 0.

    2a. RFPs receiving no bids from U.S.-flagged carriers
    Identifies the number of RFPs where zero U.S. flag (P1) offers were 
received on a single parcel.
    FY 2023. Packaged: 0. Bulk: 2.
    FY 2024 to date (as of end of April 2024). Packaged: 0. Bulk: 0.

    Question. Does USAID play a role in the Vision for Adapted Crops 
and Soils (VACS) initiative? If so, what role does it play?

    Answer. USAID invests significantly in crop improvement, building 
healthy soils, and improving agricultural practices through Feed the 
Future, which the objectives of the Department of State's VACS align 
with. As such, some of the activities and funding announced as part of 
VACS are managed by USAID and implemented through its partners. Climate 
smart varieties of seeds and productive soils are needed to tackle the 
long-term challenges to resilient food systems and agriculture-led 
growth. As a global movement seeking to mobilize resources from 
multiple public and private sector sources for resilient seeds and 
healthy soils, VACS builds on the U.S. government's work in these areas 
through Feed the Future. Moving forward, USAID and the Department of

    Question. According to the World Food Program, there are nearly 800 
million people currently facing chronic hunger around the world. USAID 
is requesting a total of $171 million in fiscal year 2025 for its 
global nutrition programs, an increase of $6 million over the fiscal 
year 2024 enacted.
    If approved, how will these additional resources be deployed?

    Answer. USAID nutrition programming is centered on supporting 
governments in improving the quality, coverage, and financing for high-
impact, evidence-based nutrition interventions. The fiscal year (FY) 
2025 Request for global nutrition programs includes $160 million in 
Global Health Programs-USAID resources, as well as $11 million in ESF 
and $500,000 in AEECA funds. If approved, the requested additional 
fiscal year 2025 resources will be deployed in support of nutrition 
programming in Afghanistan and Jordan (ESF) and Kyrgyz Republic 
(AEECA). Consistent with the priorities outlined in USAID's Global 
Malnutrition Prevention and Treatment Act of 2021 (GMPTA) 
implementation plan, requested GHP-USAID resources will be prioritized 
to bring critical, high impact nutrition services to vulnerable 
populations, especially children under 5, and pregnant and lactating 
women. This includes scaling up coverage of nutrition-specific 
interventions. All efforts to strengthen nutrition service delivery 
will be supported by collection of better nutrition data at all levels 
and rigorous monitoring and evaluation of programs.

    Question. How is nutrition being elevated within Feed the Future 
and Food for Peace development programs?

    Answer. Guided by USAID's Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Strategy, USAID 
takes an integrated approach to nutrition under the USG Feed the Future 
Initiative (FTF). USAID's recent appointment of Chief Nutritionist Dr. 
Patrick Webb underscores USAID's steadfast commitment to elevating 
nutrition with Feed the Future and Food for Peace development programs.
    In the USG's updated Global Food Security Strategy, as a key 
pathway to achieving our overarching nutrition related goal of reducing 
stunting, we have explicitly stated our intention to expand access to 
safe, affordable and healthy diets as a central aim of FTF. Globally, 
11 million deaths per year are associated with poor diets, which is 
unacceptable. For the first time, we have set a global target for FTF 
of improving women's dietary diversity. Requiring ourselves to report 
on this key outcome reflects a renewed commitment to doing and 
achieving the things that really matter for nutrition and healthy 
diets. And we know we can achieve the impact we seek. A good example 
comes from our FTF programming in Uganda. At the end of 2022, we 
implemented a population-wide survey in our geographic target zone. We 
found both a significant improvement over time in both young children 
and women's diets. We are also making greater investment in food 
systems, as these systems safeguard the way that we produce, process, 
move and consume food. And when these systems fail, we see it directly 
in the poor diets of vulnerable families and communities.
    Additionally, FTF programming is tackling the interrelated 
challenges of nutrition and climate change. A good example of this is 
our increasing investments in food safety and reducing food loss and 
waste. We need food to be safe and nutritious, and we must 
significantly reduce food loss and waste, particularly of nutrient-rich 
perishable foods that are fundamental to a diverse, nutrient-rich diet. 
This focus expands access to and affordability of nutritious foods. In 
September 2023, we announced a new $10 million food loss and waste 
accelerator fund focused on supporting small businesses to address 
food, loss, and waste in their supply chains.
    Nutrition has historically played a significant role in USAID's 
Resilience and Food Security Activities, as well as the resilience 
activities funded in part through Title II Food for Peace and targeted 
toward populations at frequent risk of shocks impacting food 
insecurity. Nutrition objectives have been integrated into the design, 
implementation, and monitoring of these activities, with an aim of 
preventing malnutrition in the most vulnerable subgroups of the target 
population, namely children under five and pregnant and lactating 
women. Activities are designed around the local nutritional context and 
address the contextual determinants of malnutrition, including access 
to safe and nutritious foods, care and feeding practices, and access to 
health care. These components are integrated within a larger model, 
ensuring that nutrition remains central to a larger food security 
focus. We know that this holistic, tailored approach works to improve 
nutrition outcomes for the poorest of the poor. For example, recent and 
ongoing Resilience and Food Security Activities in Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, 
and Kenya demonstrate that combining intensive nutrition interventions 
with livelihood programming can improve key nutrition outcomes, 
including children's diet quality, wasting, and stunting.

    Question. When, if ever, will USAID make available information on 
contractors and subgrantees on the foreign assistance dashboard, 
www.foreignassistance.gov?

    Answer. The most effective approach to enhancing publicly reported 
data quality for first-tier subawardees under USAID prime awards would 
be for enhancements to be made to the Federal Funding Accountability 
and Transparency Act Subaward Reporting System (FSRS.gov) for which the 
U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) serves as the business 
owner. Prime contractors and grant recipients report first-tier 
subcontracts and subawards in FSRS under the parameters included in 
their award terms (e.g., FAR 52.204-10, 2 CFR 170 Appendix A).
    The Office of Management and Budget has designated FSRS as the 
system of record for Federal department and agency subaward reporting. 
USAID does have two other systems in which prime partners may directly 
enter data. These are the Development Experience Clearinghouse (DEC) 
and the Development Information Solution (DIS). The primary purpose of 
the DEC is to serve as the repository of USAID's collective development 
experience over the past 60 years.
    Amongst other documentation, the DEC includes annual reports, 
assessments and evaluations.
    The primary purpose of the DIS is to serve as USAID's portfolio 
management platform--including the submission of performance data 
directly from prime partners. Subaward information is sometimes 
reported in documents USAID partners upload to the DEC; however, the 
DEC is unlikely to provide comprehensive information on first-tier 
subawards as there is no requirement that primes include subaward 
reporting in such documents. USAID would need additional time to 
determine if there are technical methods that could reliably extract 
extant subaward information from the DEC, and then would need to 
estimate associated cost. We would also need additional time to 
generate a cost estimate for a first-tier subaward reporting 
functionality in the DIS that includes enhanced subaward reporting. The 
current legal framework would not permit a separate USAID reporting 
requirement, additional to FSRS, for first-tier subawards.
    USAID shares concerns about the quality of subaward data in FSRS as 
well as the need for greater data transparency and accessibility. As it 
relates to data quality, USAID undertook strategic efforts to improve 
the quality of the data in two key ways. As detailed below, we have 
advocated for changes to improve data through several FSRS working 
groups with GSA over the past several years and continue to advocate 
for features in the forthcoming new system in the System for Award 
Management (SAM.gov). More recently, USAID launched data quality 
improvement efforts, publishing a new FSRS Reporting Guidance one-pager 
to supplement FSRS instructions that specifies that primes must report 
subcontracts and subawards based on their obligated amount. As a result 
of these communications, internal review of the data and outreach to 
partners to remedy data quality issues, the quality of the data in FSRS 
has improved and reduced over-reporting above total obligation amounts.
    Over time, USAID has provided input to GSA on changes to FSRS that 
would be beneficial for improving the accuracy of first-tier subaward 
data reported in FSRS. These include: (1) an automated system user 
warning when a subaward obligation total is not aligned with a prime 
award obligation total; (2) removal validation rules that would flag 
and address instances where the subaward date entered in SFRS is prior 
to the award signed date; (3) system user instructions that provide 
clearer guidance on how primes should enter changes in subaward 
obligations into the system; and (4) requiring that subaward reporting 
match prime award reporting at the ``action'' level, enabling greater 
transparency into subaward obligations by fiscal year and maintaining 
consistency in reporting level with prime awards. GSA has recently 
advised that it intends to address the first three changes in a future 
iteration of the system, which it plans will take shape as a new module 
in SAM.gov. GSA has indicated it does not plan to pursue the fourth 
change. This is based on the rationale that it would require statutory 
and/or regulatory changes.
    Understanding the importance of strengthening first-tier subaward 
data for USAID's mission and recognizing it is not the business owner 
of FSRS, the Agency has made a number of efforts to strengthen the 
reporting of its prime partners in FSRS. First, USAID issued multiple 
communications to our contractors and recipients to remind them of 
their reporting responsibilities. USAID also routinely monitors and 
analyzes data reported in FSRS to proactively identify potential 
discrepancies. Based on certain reporting anomalies identified through 
this analysis, USAID has conducted direct outreach to multiple 
implementing partners to discuss further and request corrections to 
improve quality of the data.
    More recently, in January 2024, USAID issued a series of new tools 
to further improve the quality of data reported in FSRS. USAID 
published a new guidance page on WorkwithUSAID.gov, which highlights 
FSRS guidance documents, provides a ``one-pager'' with tips and best 
practices on entering and updating data in FSRS, and links to an Agency 
webinar, one of several we have offered to the partner community.
    Internally, for agency staff, USAID developed a new ``Subaward/
Subcontract Data Quality Dashboard'' in our agency Enterprise Reporting 
Portal for monitoring partners' compliance with FSRS reporting. This 
dashboard populates with data from FSRS in a user-friendly format, 
empowering USAID staff to review subcontract and subaward information, 
drill down on potential data quality discrepancies, and follow up with 
implementing partners to request they make corrections in FSRS. One 
option the Agency could pursue, provided it receives new funding, is to 
make the internal Subaward/ Subcontract Data Quality Dashboard 
available to the public as part of the Explore USAID in Action website 
that presents a USAID-specific view of USAID's information which is 
already published on foreignassistance.gov. The effort to present USAID 
data reported in FSRS and foreignassistance.gov in a more user-friendly 
format on a USAID website would require additional one time development 
costs of approximately $250,000 and ongoing annual operating costs of 
approximately $100,000 that are not currently funded.
    Finally, USAID's Systems Support team has provided troubleshooting 
assistance to our implementing partners experiencing technical 
difficulties with the FSRS system itself. Many prime contractors and 
recipients report challenges in maintaining the accuracy of their 
reported data in GSA's FSRS system, as it is a legacy system that 
requires significant updates by GSA to improve its functionality.
    To improve quality of data, USAID plans to add a section in the 
Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) that the 
partner complied with mandatory sub-award reporting.

    Question. What is the average Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate 
Agreement (NICRA) rate for USAID's implementing partners working in the 
humanitarian space, including for international organization, 
international non-governmental organizations, local non-governmental 
organization, and contractors? Please note that this response, if 
deemed procurement sensitive, may be shared in a Committee Confidential 
manner.

    Answer. Based on a sample of current contracts with our 15 largest 
implementing partners (and representing an illustrative range of 
countries and programs), it is typical for USAID to reimburse for 
overhead costs ranging between 10 percent and 30 percent. For example, 
for U.N. organizations, it is typical for USAID to reimburse for 
overhead costs ranging between 6 percent and 13 percent. The World Food 
Program and UNICEF, for example, are at 6 percent and 7 percent 
respectively.
    USAID operates in 100 countries and across a very wide range of 
sectors--context matters for fully understanding the ranges presented 
here. These rates, for example, tend to be higher in war and conflict-
heavy zones, and lower in more stable areas. But no matter the country, 
security situation, or specific local context, our processes for 
negotiating and overseeing these rates are always based on Federal 
regulations and aligned with all other US government agencies.
    Organizations independently select the accounting structures and 
accounting methodologies best suited to recover indirect costs under 
Federal awards. The type and the number of indirect cost rates vary by 
organization. Some of the factors that can impact an organization's 
indirect cost rates include but are not limited to:

    <bullet> Size of Organization

    <bullet> Type of Organization (e.g., nonprofit, for-profit, PIO, 
type of business/service provided)

    <bullet> Age of Organization

    <bullet> Location of Organization

    <bullet> The rate structure used by the Organization

    <bullet> The indirect cost base(s) used by the Organization

    Because of the various factors listed above, any average, if 
calculated, is not meaningful without context when applied across 
multiple awards under differing circumstances and structures.

    Question. You've previously stated that: ``We support . . . natural 
gas programming in instances where it can create energy access while 
not delaying plans toward clean energy because again the collective 
carbon emissions even from developing countries, we are all part of the 
solution when it comes to mitigation.''
    Please provide a list and description of all natural gas projects 
that USAID has supported since January 1, 2022.

    Answer. USAID does not centrally track specific gas projects 
supported by USAID. Around the world, the majority of USAID assistance 
typically supports th eenabling environment for the provision of 
improved energy services rather than the direct acquisition or 
construction of energy technologies. A description of technical 
assistance supporting the gas sector is listed below, by country and/or 
region.

    Question. In light of the ongoing constriction of operational space 
in Zimbabwe and the Government of Zimbabwe's harassment, detention, and 
deportation of US officials and contractors, how is USAID modifying its 
programming across all sectors to adapt to these circumstances?

    Answer. Our bilateral assistance program in Zimbabwe is focused on 
democracy, human rights, and governance; health; agriculture and food 
security; and adaptation and environment, as well as on humanitarian 
assistance. USAID development and humanitarian assistance is for the 
benefit of the people of Zimbabwe and delivered through international 
and local implementing partners--not through the Government of Zimbabwe 
via government-to-government assistance.
    USAID has in place a range of measures applicable to all sectors 
that are able to be continually adapted to the operational environment. 
These include:

    <bullet> An extensive Mission Continuity Plan that includes a tool 
to track in-country and international travel for mission staff and TDY 
visits, as well as communication plans to account for all employees, 
including contractors.

    <bullet> A Partner Liaison Security Officer (PLSO) that works 
closely with the Regional Security Officer and USAID implementing 
partners on security. PLSO support to partners includes establishing 
and managing an implementing partner security incident reporting 
system; creating communication platforms for Chiefs of Party and 
security POCs; assisting to develop partner security plans and 
training; and holding regular meetings with partners on security 
issues.

    <bullet> The Victims of Torture & Abuse Emergency Response (VOTAER) 
program that provides protection and rehabilitation services to 
individuals at risk of falling or who have fallen victim to organized 
violence, torture, and other human rights abuses and to help victims 
hold perpetrators to account. VOTAER provides legal, medical, and other 
protection, rehabilitative, and support services to victims of 
political violence and torture, as well domestic relocation support and 
referral to domestic and international protection mechanisms. While we 
now view this activity as a core support activity in Zimbabwe--
providing comprehensive legal, medical, and other protection, 
rehabilitative, and support services and available to partners and 
civil society--it is not something that is done in all countries and 
contexts. This was begun in 2020 and continually supported in 
recognition of the risks and challenges in Zimbabwe.

    USAID also continues to work with local organizations in Zimbabwe 
that advocate for human rights and the rule of law. Amid the ongoing 
crackdown on civil society and a range of other challenges, it is 
important that the international community continue to support the 
Zimbabwean people who are fighting for transparency, accountability, 
and the rule of law.

    Question. Could you please inform me when my office might 
anticipate receiving a response from USAID regarding the plans for 
future Democracy, Rights, and Governance (DRG) programming in Nigeria, 
as outlined in my letter dated September 5, 2023, and committed to in 
the agency's subsequent response?

    Answer. Your office should have received an initial response to the 
September 5 letter in November 2023, and you can expect a response on 
future programming after May 2024.
    Additionally, USAID will send you the IFES Post Election Survey in 
Nigeria, 2023 document. This nationwide post-election survey explores 
the opinions and perspectives of Nigerian citizens on the 2023 
Presidential and National Assembly Elections in Nigeria. Please also 
find attached a final copy of the review of the Independent National 
Electoral Commission's performance by IFES. USAID also expects to 
receive the final third-party evaluation of our election work, which 
includes an examination of political party strengthening, by 
approximately the end of May 2024. USAID plans to examine the findings 
of the requested evaluations, along with other data, to inform, adapt, 
and implement future programming.

    Question. Could you share your viewpoint regarding the arrangement 
whereby USAID and State Department officials, displaced from Sudan, are 
stationed separately (with USAID personnel in Nairobi and State 
Department staff in Addis Ababa) under the administration of the Sudan 
Affairs Office?

    Answer. Communication and collaboration between the State 
Department and USAID is strong and effective, and while it would be 
ideal to house the State Department Office of Sudan Affairs and USAID/
Sudan in a single location, our teams are making the best of a 
difficult situation given the circumstances.
    USAID's current operational platform for our work in Sudan is 
spread out across several locations. Nairobi, Kenya is the base of 
operations and includes the Mission Director and support staff as well 
as the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance's Disaster Assistance 
Response Team and Office of Transition Initiatives offices. Cairo, 
Egypt and Kampala, Uganda are locations where our Foreign Service 
National Staff self-evacuated.
    USAID is undertaking a process to evaluate options for 
consolidating the USAID/Sudan mission presence over the next year. Key 
factors in this process include determining where our Sudanese staff 
can gain and maintain the necessary legal status to continue their 
employment with USAID, and where we can be best positioned to oversee 
our substantial foreign assistance investments in Sudan. In this 
process, we are consulting closely with our State colleagues and we 
will continue to engage with the relevant staff and committees as this 
process continues.

    Question. How can USAID effectively address the growing crises in 
Africa, particularly in Sudan, Eastern Congo, and the Sahel, given the 
agency's limited resources to reduce human suffering, instability, and 
the erosion of democracy?

    Answer. In Sudan, where it is safe and possible to deliver 
assistance, USAID continues to support programs focused on building 
peace, reducing the need for humanitarian assistance, protecting human 
rights, promoting democracy, empowering civil society, and providing 
psycho-social support. USAID also supports and works through local 
partners in difficult crisis contexts. We have focused on scaling up 
life-saving activities through existing international partners' support 
to local Sudanese organizations and are increasing levels of assistance 
to local organizations, including by encouraging our implementing 
partners to support civil society organizations, youth groups, health 
care workers, and other community groups. These local groups are a 
vital link to Sudanese communities, helping assess and respond to 
urgent needs and delivering life-saving assistance such as medical 
supplies, water and sanitation, lifesaving nutrition, market-based 
assistance, shelter, and protection services including gender-based 
violence prevention and response to people in the most affected areas, 
especially Khartoum. Local groups not only enable USAID to reach 
otherwise inaccessible populations in need, but also provide a cost 
effective vehicle for assisting them.
    Local organizations provide critical support for the delivery of 
humanitarian assistance in Sudan because of their unique capacities, 
local knowledge, important networks, and trust and acceptance by the 
communities they serve. To leverage those local capacities, USAID's 
Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance provided an estimated $29 million to 
support nearly 40 local partner organizations in fiscal year 2023. The 
bulk of this funding is going to Sudanese NGO's that function as 
implementing partners for many international NGO's and U.N. agencies. A 
smaller portion goes directly to small civil society groups to meet 
critical humanitarian needs in their communities. We also supported 
more than 100 local Sudanese organizations with over $6 million in 
small grants through our transition assistance and democracy and 
governance portfolios.
    With support from USAID and other donors, USAID's partner the World 
Food Program reached an estimated 6.5 million people across Sudan with 
food assistance between April 15, 2023, and January 31, 2024, reaching 
approximately 728,000 people in January alone. Between April 15, 2023 
and January 31, 2024, USAID partner UNICEF and other nutrition actors 
screened 3.7 million children aged 5 years and younger for malnutrition 
and admitted more than 231,000 children for treatment of severe acute 
malnutrition in Sudan.
    USAID and the Department of State's Bureau of Population, Refugees, 
and Migration are supporting the International Organization for 
Migration, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, UNICEF, World Health 
Organization, and NGO's to improve access to safe drinking water and 
sanitation infrastructure for crisis-affected communities across Sudan 
to reduce the spread of infectious diseases, such as cholera and 
measles. With U.S. and other donor support, UNICEF and other water, 
sanitation, and hygiene actors provided safe drinking water to an 
estimated 8.4 million people across Sudan between April 15, 2023, and 
January 31, 2024. To prevent the spread of cholera, U.S. Government 
partners are also supporting affected and at-risk populations with 
emergency water, sanitation, and hygiene supplies, such as chlorine for 
water purification, hygiene kits, and water containers. USAID partners 
UNICEF and the World Health Organization reached 2.2 million people in 
Sudan's Gedaref and Gezira states with oral cholera vaccines in 
November and December 2023.
    USAID partner UNICEF helped 186,000 women and children access 
gender-based violence prevention, risk mitigation, and response 
interventions in 2023. Mobile clinics supported by USAID partner UNFPA 
provided health and gender-based violence prevention and response 
services to more than 73,000 internally displaced persons and host 
community members across 11 of Sudan's 18 states between April 15, 2023 
and February 5, 2024. USAID also supports the U.N. Mine Action Service 
to provide critical mine risk awareness information for populations 
residing in or returning to conflict-affected areas potentially 
affected by explosive remnants of war.
    In eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where fighting has 
displaced millions of people, USAID's humanitarian partners have been 
providing life-saving assistance to address critical shelter, emergency 
food, water, sanitation and hygiene, protection, and health needs among 
the most vulnerable populations. USAID is the largest provider of 
humanitarian assistance to DRC, and in this fiscal year to date, has 
committed more than $360 million of humanitarian assistance to respond 
to the crisis. In 2023, 5.3 million people across DRC were reached by 
food assistance funded, in large part, by USAID.
    USAID also supports peacebuilding and people-to-people 
reconciliation programs in eastern DRC. USAID's humanitarian activities 
address the drivers of conflict that gave rise to and continue to fuel 
the activities of armed groups and community militias; support progress 
toward an eventual transition from humanitarian assistance to 
development; and empower marginalized communities.
    In the Sahel, USAID continues to implement activities not subject 
to 7008 restrictions or that have received waivers: supporting the 
delivery of health, food, and humanitarian assistance that saves lives 
and reduces human suffering. USAID delivers emergency food to countries 
in the Sahel, including Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, 
Niger, and Nigeria, that are facing acute food insecurity. USAID 
support has improved maternal and child health, and reduced infections, 
disease, and supported livelihoods. In Cameroon, USAID works with the 
Ministry of Public Health on the free distribution of antiretroviral 
medications through private pharmacies. In Chad, USAID's Bureau of 
Humanitarian Assistance partners with the International Organization 
for Migration to provide shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene 
services to more than 78,000 returnees affected by the Sudan crisis. In 
addition, USAID supports Chad's National Malaria Control Program to 
control the spread of Malaria, and supports routine vaccinations, 
including polio, to decrease infant and child mortality. In Mauritania, 
USAID's humanitarian assistance supports 110,000 Malian refugees, via 
the provision of an integrated assistance package, including food 
assistance, school meals, and specialized nutritious food to children, 
pregnant women, and girls for malnutrition treatment. In Mali USAID 
supports the provision of emergency food assistance to reach at-risk 
populations--including internally displaced persons and host community 
members--in food-insecure regions. In Nigeria, USAID funding is 
enabling deliveries of emergency food assistance and vital health care, 
among other services, to crisis and conflict-affected areas. In Niger, 
USAID uses a context-specific approach to help farmers and micro, 
small, and medium-sized enterprises, particularly women and youth-owned 
or managed businesses, move toward livelihood development, financial 
prosperity and job security. Finally, in Burkina Faso, USAID programs 
improve skills and offer economic opportunities for marginalized youth 
and women, which reduces their vulnerability to recruitment and 
exploitation by extremist groups.

    Question. The escalating crises and instability in Africa demand 
more humanitarian aid from USAID, significantly as famine risks rise.
    With food being weaponized in conflicts, as seen in Ethiopia and 
Sudan, and U.S.-funded food aid diverted, as in Ethiopia and Somalia, 
how is USAID addressing increasing needs while ensuring that aid 
reaches those who need it most, particularly in conflict zones like 
Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Sahel, Somalia, and South 
Sudan?

    Answer. USAID's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA) provides 
humanitarian assistance in Africa, and throughout the world, through 
independent and trusted non-governmental organizations (NGO) and public 
international organization (PIO) implementing partners. BHA-funded 
programs addressing food and other humanitarian needs are subject to 
BHA's established internal risk assessment process, which includes 
internal and external due diligence processes. For example, all of our 
partners are required to submit a Risk Assessment and Management Plan 
(RAMP) as part of their applications for funding, which are then 
reviewed by our technical risk management staff. The RAMP details the 
partner's plans for risk mitigation and includes their internal 
controls to prevent loss, theft, and broader fraud, waste, and abuse, 
including diversion of humanitarian assistance. Partners are also 
required to report all incidents of waste, fraud, and abuse to USAID's 
Office of Inspector General (OIG). In addition to partner risk 
mitigation measures, BHA staff conduct site visits, as security 
conditions allow. BHA also utilizes third-party monitoring contracts in 
22 countries to monitor programs. These monitors are trained to detect 
and report on program irregularities to USAID. In the case of Ethiopia, 
BHA directed a pause in food aid programming in order to immediately 
halt diversion and put in place critical reforms so that food 
assistance reached those for whom it was intended.
    In light of recent incidents of diversion in Africa, and 
recognizing that humanitarian crises often occur in high-risk 
environments, BHA is launching a new action plan to assess and mitigate 
diversion risks across all of our programs. We take very seriously any 
allegation of diversion of humanitarian aid, and we have zero tolerance 
for inaction in the face of fraud, waste, and abuse.
    As part of this action plan, BHA has taken the following steps:

    <bullet> We have stood up a working group of experts in 
humanitarian assistance and risk management to develop and implement a 
comprehensive roadmap to address diversion risks around the world.

    <bullet> We are engaging our staff around the world and partners to 
identify the most up-to-date issues and best practices, and ensure that 
our oversight mechanisms adapt to how diversion attempts have evolved.

    <bullet> We're reviewing the locations and levels of our third-
party monitors around the world so that we are well positioned to 
address risks globally.

    <bullet> We are reviewing field staffing levels across programs, 
developing new guidance for staff and partners, and creating new 
training for staff across the globe.

    <bullet> We expanded our annual internal risk analysis process for 
identifying high-risk countries to include diversion risk factors. With 
this new process will come greater oversight on such risks.

    <bullet> In coordination with the USAID OIG, we implemented a 
mandatory annual fraud awareness briefing for all staff. Additionally, 
we are coordinating with the OIG to target field-based training for 
humanitarian partners.

    Agency leadership have also engaged with the heads of key partners 
on these reform initiatives. We are implementing some steps now, but 
others will take additional time to develop. As a whole, the action 
plan will put us in a much better position to ensure aid is getting to 
those who need it and help us continue to be good stewards of taxpayer 
dollars.
    The diversion of food assistance in East Africa last year also 
served to highlight the need for reform and enhanced accountability to 
affected populations in WFP operations. BHA is prioritizing eight areas 
of reform with WFP, six of which are directly linked to mitigating the 
risk of diversion.
    In 2023, WFP's Deputy Executive Director launched a high-level task 
force, activating the whole organization in order to put ``end-to-end'' 
assurance and internal control measures in place across all high-risk 
operations. This work includes clarifying accountability where 
necessary, strengthening systems, streamlining processes and making 
sure that country offices are getting the advice and support that they 
need.
    In September 2023, WFP presented its global Assurance Framework and 
Reassurance Action Plan to its Executive Board, in which the U.S. 
Government participates through BHA. These efforts signaled WFP's 
recognition of the need to accelerate reforms in a number of areas 
including monitoring, identity management, cooperating partners, and 
supply chain operations.
    BHA is strongly supportive of WFP's reforms efforts, and plans to 
closely follow implementation, including through close monitoring at 
the field level and field-headquarters consultations to share lessons 
learned across high-risk environments.

    Question. In the Fiscal Year 2025 President's Budget Request, 
Somalia was the recipient of the second-largest bilateral allocation 
for Democracy, Rights, and Governance (DRG) funding in Africa, 
amounting to $26 million, following Ethiopia's request of $30 million.
    1. Could you provide the reasons behind Somalia's consistent 
position as the top beneficiary of DRG funding in Africa regarding 
annual requests?
    2. Could you specify the types of programs that USAID plans to 
support with this DRG allocation for Somalia?

    Answer. Given the threat that al-Shabaab (AS) plays in Somalia and 
across the region and its importance to U.S. national security, Somalia 
remains one of the top priorities for Africa DRG programming, 
especially given that it encompassess our support for stabilization 
activities in areas previously held by AS. With the U.S. Government's 
broader approach to advance the Government of Somalia's active efforts 
to erode AS' influence, USAID has made meaningful investments to its 
peace and stability.
    USAID plans to support DRG-funded programs that address the 
underlying conditions that allow violent extremism to flourish. USAID 
will continue to work with the federal, state, and local governments 
across South-Central Somalia to promote stability in communities 
liberated from al-Shabaab rule, rebuild trust between citizens and 
their government, foster reconciliation between communities, and help 
establish and strengthen systems of governance. Our planned programming 
includes efforts to promote more inclusive and responsive governance 
institutions at the federal, state and local levels, address long-
standing grievances that drive communities toward al-Shabaab, increase 
citizen participation in political processes, and support broader 
efforts to finalize Somalia's state building process. These diverse 
programs are designed to reduce the influence of al-Shabaab as the 
largest al-Qaeda affiliate in the world, and in doing so, advance a top 
U.S. foreign policy priority in Somalia.

    Question. Since the inception of the Hassan Sheikh Mohamud 
administration and the Federal Government of Somalia's intensified 
efforts to combat the terrorist group al-Shabaab, USAID has primarily 
directed its non-humanitarian initiatives in Somalia toward 
stabilization efforts in areas recently liberated from al-Shabaab's 
control.
    1. Could you provide an overview of the accomplishments of USAID's 
programming in this domain thus far?
    2. In light of the recent challenges encountered by Operation Black 
Lion, are there any considerations for modifying the current approach?

    Answer. A decade ago, the federal government of Somalia was barely 
formed and al-Shabaab (AS) controlled vast swaths of territory, and the 
government's security forces consisted of disparate militia groups. 
There has been significant progress toward securing the country. 
USAID's stabilization efforts have been focused in liberated areas, and 
are closely coordinated across the interagency so that defense, 
diplomacy, and development efforts remain aligned as we work to provide 
for a lasting expansion of government authority. USAID has addressed 
fragility in the context of Somalia not just focused on degrading al-
Shabaab or retaking territory, but also on how relationships--within 
communities, between communities, and between local, state, and federal 
structures--are rebalanced so they are more peaceful and stable. When 
communities joined forces to dislodge al-Shabaab from areas of Middle 
Shabelle and Galmudug, USAID was among the first donors to deliver 
support to these communities. As a result, the Somali state has now 
established authority in areas previously under al-Shabaab rule for 
more than a decade.
    Phase 2 operations, previously known as `Operation Black Lion,' 
have encountered setbacks in recent months due to infighting between 
federal, state and local elites, a resurgence of clan conflict, and 
long-standing weaknesses within security forces. With new military 
operations on hold for the time being, USAID plans to work on 
consolidating security gains from Phase 1 and addressing key grievances 
in order to prevent the resurgence of al-Shabaab in previously 
liberated communities. USAID will continue to work closely with local 
authorities in communities recently liberated from AS to advance inter-
communal reconciliation, promote more legitimate and effective 
governance institutions, and strengthen conflict mitigation processes, 
in order to provide a more credible alternative to AS rule. In light of 
liberated communities' expectations for better services after years of 
neglect, helping manage and respond to these expectations and needs is 
crucial.

    Question. South Sudan is scheduled to hold elections in 2024, yet 
many questions remain outstanding regarding basic preparation and 
political will to enact vital reforms for an inclusive and democratic 
process.
    Please confirm that USAID will not provide support of any kind to 
South Sudan's anticipated electoral process.

    Answer. USAID will not provide support of any kind to South Sudan's 
anticipated electoral process. We share your concern that the 
conditions, institutions, and resources for conducting credible 
elections through an inclusive, transparent, and democratic process in 
December 2024 remain elusive. We do provide training to journalists on 
elections related issues to help prepare and enable them to serve as a 
source of transparency for the population and a force for 
accountability of government actions. We continue to remind the 
government of its obligations, including making resources available to 
fund electoral institutions with adequate time to make the appropriate 
preparations.

    Question. The budget request does not include sufficient funding to 
address the urgent needs of Ukraine in its fight against Russian 
aggression. I have made clear to the administration that it needs to 
incorporate funds for Ukraine into the base budget accompanied by a 
comprehensive strategy, instead of relying on emergency supplemental 
appropriations. It is uncertain whether further supplemental funds will 
be passed for fiscal year 2024, and it is extremely unlikely that any 
supplemental funds will be passed in fiscal year 2025.
    How does USAID plan to address the dire needs of Ukraine in fiscal 
year 2025, given that the fiscal year 2025 budget request for Ukraine 
is much smaller compared to the supplemental funds passed in prior FYs?

    Answer. The President's Budget Request for fiscal year (FY) 2025 
was developed with the expectation that the National Security 
Supplemental would be enacted, and we are enormously appreciative of 
Congress' leadership and bold action in that regard. In combination 
with Supplemental resources, the fiscal year 2025 request includes 
funding levels that begin the path toward normalization of a base 
budget for Ukraine, as well as for other needs that stem from Russia's 
invasion, such as strengthening Ukraine's economy, improving food 
security, countering misinformation, and enhancing energy security.
    Our economic assistance helps Ukraine's private sector and tax base 
grow, reducing reliance on humanitarian assistance and budget support. 
Our budget support will continue to be conditioned on policy reforms.

    Question. Previous emergency supplemental appropriation packages 
for Ukraine have included funds that have been obligated for purposes 
unrelated to the war in Ukraine.
    1. Why was funding for these non-Ukraine related purposes requested 
through emergency supplemental appropriations requests instead of the 
base budget?
    2. Does USAID recognize the risks of relying on off-budget 
emergency supplemental appropriations to fund regular annual 
programming?

    Answer. Putin's unjustified war continues to cause catastrophic 
loss of life and has undermined the security of Europe and the global 
economy, far beyond the borders of Ukraine itself. USAID works to 
support the people of Ukraine and counter Russia's political and 
economic aggression and malign influence throughout Europe and Eurasia 
(E&E).
    As the Kremlin continues targeting democratic institutions and 
civil society in the E&E region, USAID assistance provided by the 
supplemental is strengthening connections between citizens and their 
governments, and strengthening civil society and independent media to 
hold governments accountable. This includes support for a Russian-
language news cooperative with partners from Belarus, Azerbaijan, 
Armenia, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine to increase trusted, engaging, 
and fact-based news and information for local citizens and improve the 
ability of the news cooperative members to become a more financially 
viable, innovative, and competitive alternative news base to Kremlin-
supported news sites, which spread propaganda and hate speech, and 
manipulate news and information about the full-scale invasion of 
Ukraine.
    The generous support of Congress through several Ukraine 
supplemental appropriations acts--and their broad authorization to 
utilize humanitarian assistance funding to meet the global needs 
stemming from Russia's war against Ukraine--was instrumental to USAID's 
ability to reach people with lifesaving, multi-sectoral humanitarian 
assistance. In addition to the humanitarian assistance, some of the 
funds from the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act 
(AUSAA) were allocated to bolster Ukraine's global agricultural 
exports, thereby improving both global food security and Ukraine's 
economic situation through increased export revenue.
    USAID is also focused on building E&E partners' capacities to blunt 
the Kremlin's ability to use energy as a weapon for political goals. 
Thanks to Congress' bipartisan support, USAID assistance enabled 
Moldova to secure natural gas supply from European and other regional 
suppliers to meet all of the natural gas demand for the Right Bank of 
the Nistru River (the territory controlled by the Moldovan government 
in Chisinau, excluding the breakaway separatist region of Transnistria) 
since December 2022. Additionally, USAID was able to help Moldova 
secure a share of the first shipment of U.S. Liquified Natural Gas 
(LNG) through the Alexandroupolis Floating Storage and Regasification 
Unit (FSRU) Terminal in April this year.
    In combination with the Supplemental resources generously provided 
by Congress, the President's Budget Request for fiscal year 2025 
includes funding levels that begin the path toward normalization of a 
base budget for Ukraine, as well as for other needs that stem from 
Russia's invasion, such as food security, countering information 
manipulation, supporting transition initiatives, and strengthening 
energy security. USAID recognizes the risk of relying on emergency 
supplementals, hence the request to normalize base budgets that would 
fulfill other needs related to the war in Ukraine.

    Question. Requested funding for programs in Georgia across multiple 
accounts has been reduced compared to prior years.
    What is the rationale for this reduction in the request?

    Answer. The President's Budget Request for fiscal year 2025 
reflects shifting needs across the region.

    Question. Has USAID observed an increase or decrease in the 
effectiveness of Georgia programming in recent years?

    Answer. USAID programming is flexible in many respects to adapt to 
new opportunities or challenges and USAID actively monitors its 
programs to determine that investments are yielding intended outcomes. 
USAID's investments in Georgia have helped to build critical public 
support toward integration with the West. Georgians overwhelmingly hold 
positive views of the U.S. and do not see their future with Russia. 
USAID programming has remained effective in Georgia, including by 
helping civil society build capacity and by strengthening inclusive 
economic growth and economic linkages with the West.

    Question. Does USAID believe that assistance to Georgia should be 
conditioned on the fulfillment of certain standards or benchmarks? Why 
or why not?

    Answer. The beneficiaries of most of USAID assistance in Georgia 
are predominantly non-governmental, private sector, and sub-national 
actors. Conditioning such assistance on benchmarks reached by the 
government of Georgia would potentially allow the ruling party to 
deprive mostly non-governmental, sub-national, and private sector 
actors of U.S. support that is used, for example, to advance greater 
government transparency and build westward trade linkages. Our 
development assistance remains a critical tool for supporting the 
people of Georgia as they seek Western integration and to hold their 
government accountable.

    Question. The war in Ukraine initially dealt a blow to Russia's 
regional credibility and opened up a window of opportunity for the U.S. 
to increase bilateral ties and influence with countries in the South 
Caucasus and Central Asia over which Russia has historically exerted 
influence.
    How is this budget request designed to take advantage of this 
window of opportunity to increase U.S. ties with partners in the South 
Caucasus and Central Asia?

    Answer. In response to Russia's brutal war and diminished standing, 
USAID is adapting its bilateral and regional assistance to the South 
Caucasus and Central Asia to mitigate and weaken Russia's malign 
influence in political and economic spheres in the region.
    Recognizing this window of opportunity, USAID is prioritizing 
support for Armenia as the government proceeds to institute democratic 
reforms and pursue closer ties with the U.S. and European Union (EU). 
Fiscal year (FY) 2025 funding will help strengthen Armenia's food and 
energy security, reducing the country's structural reliance on Russian 
exports to meet its basic needs and depriving the Kremlin of a critical 
tool which it could leverage to derail Armenia's democratic transition. 
USAID programming will also support initiatives to counter corruption 
and support independent media, consolidating recent democratic gains 
that Armenia has made since the 2018 Velvet Revolution, as well as 
bolster regional connectivity.
    In Georgia, fiscal year 2025 funding will continue to work to 
strengthen Georgia's resilience to external malign influence, civil 
society, independent media, human rights, accountable governance, and 
diversify Georgia's economy away from Russia. USAID will continue to 
build on prior development progress and leverage public sentiment, with 
approximately 80 percent of the population seeking to join the EU, to 
anchor the country's future in the West politically and economically.
    In addition, USAID is increasing its support for the development of 
the `Middle Corridor,' an economically transformative corridor running 
from Central Asia through Azerbaijan and Georgia to Europe. USAID 
support for the Middle Corridor will provide businesses in Central Asia 
and the South Caucasus an alternative to Russian trade routes in 
transporting goods to Western Europe, reducing the Kremlin's economic 
influence over both regions and depriving it of additional transit 
revenue that could be used to support its military operations in 
Ukraine.
    In Central Asia, following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, 
the five Central Asian countries (C5) (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, 
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan) are exhibiting a greater 
openness to diversifying their political and economic partnerships, 
both through closer cooperation with each other and through closer 
engagement with the United States and the West. Simultaneously, with 
half of the region's population under the age of 30, the C5 governments 
are under intense pressure to ensure widespread economic prosperity and 
rethink their prevailing economic systems that favor large, state-owned 
enterprises focused on resource extraction. USAID is adapting to this 
time-limited window of opportunity to expand our partnerships and 
provide critical development assistance to Central Asia in ways that 
help strengthen independence, sovereignty, and prosperity.
    Demonstrating our commitment to greater partnership, I traveled to 
the region and convened a `C5+1' Ministerial at which the governments 
signed memoranda of understanding with commitments to key reforms to 
standardize and digitize customs, and to support the clean energy 
transition. Our regional development assistance is an engine of the 
C5+1 platform, focused on increasing trade connectivity (including 
through support to the Middle Corridor mentioned above), facilitating 
transboundary energy sharing between the C5, promoting regional water 
security, and advancing collective efforts to counter violent extremism 
and combat trafficking in persons. At the same time, our bilateral 
missions across the region are supporting market-based economic 
development for small and medium enterprises, increasing the region's 
human capital through US-modeled education curricula and modernized 
healthcare systems, promoting civil society and a free media as an 
integral part of the C5's development process, and amplifying political 
reforms--especially in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, where the countries' 
respective leaders are undertaking gradual political modernization and 
other reforms. Through this development assistance, the United States 
is demonstrating that we are a reliable partner and building on an 
already-strong foundation in the region to advance shared national 
interests with the C5.

    Question. While direct bilateral and regional engagement with these 
countries is important, how is USAID also ensuring that assistance to 
Ukraine supports an image of the U.S. as a credible partner in the eyes 
of these nations?

    Answer. The passage of the National Security Supplemental package 
for Ukraine reinforces the image of the U.S. as a credible, steadfast 
partner, narrowing opportunities for China and Russia to expand their 
regional influence. For example, USAID's Ukraine programming places 
special emphasis on the strategic sectors of democracy, energy, and 
trade, all with an eye toward deepening Ukraine's interconnections to 
European markets and institutions. Those same themes are essential in 
our work in the South Caucasus. In Armenia, for example, USAID is 
focused on consolidating democratic gains and diversifying the 
country's economy and energy supplies away from Russia to make both 
sectors more resilient to malign influence.
    In Central Asia, USAID promotes the creation of a safe, vibrant 
information space and improves access to quality news content espousing 
diverse viewpoints. For instance, USAID supported a January 2024 forum 
in Uzbekistan where activists, bloggers, public organizations, and 
high-ranking government officials responsible for information policy 
developed recommendations to improve digital information space in 
Uzbekistan and promote TV channels from friendly neighboring countries. 
In similar ways across the region, USAID programming is actively 
expanding the suite of media available to Central Asians. As a result, 
we are strengthening the capacity, independence, and reach of local 
media to reduce the reliance on Russian media that uses Kremlin news 
sources and propaganda to actively malign the U.S. Government's role in 
Ukraine and throughout the region.
                      countering russia in africa
    Question. Please describe USAID's plans for the new programs to 
counter Russian influence in Africa in detail and explain which 
accounts will fund these efforts.

    Answer. The fiscal year 2025 request includes $25.0 million in 
Economic Support Fund resources for the Counter Russian Malign Actors 
in Africa (CRMMA) fund. The CRMAA will provide additional, flexible 
support to counter disinformation, build resistance to Kremlin-linked 
disinformation, strengthen institutional resilience, revitalize civil 
society, and improve electoral systems and processes across Africa.
    Our programs will strengthen the capacity of journalists and civil 
society to identify, track, and respond to information manipulation, 
limit the spread of information manipulation to multiple distribution 
networks both offline and online, and improve digital and media 
literacy and security.
    New activities across the continent include the following:

    <bullet> Supporting regional networks of organizations working on 
information manipulation (e.g. fact checking organizations, 
journalists, influencers, technologists) to collaborate and share 
content and research.

    <bullet> Providing local organizations with the tools, knowledge, 
models, and resources to track and respond to information manipulation.

    <bullet> Promoting peace, tolerance, good governance, and human 
rights as well as combating information manipulation through a range of 
media channels, including social media and community radio at regional, 
national, and local levels.

    <bullet> Engaging youth at risk of being mobilized by false 
information through truthful and interactive content on radio and 
social media.

    <bullet> Expanding relationships with radio stations to develop 
information products and programming to inform citizens on the issues 
and how they can get involved.

    <bullet> Building local resilience to information manipulation by 
partnering with community leaders to strengthen communications and 
relations with municipal authorities.
                   countering prc influence in europe
    Question. Please describe USAID's plans for the programs to counter 
PRC influence in Europe in detail and explain which accounts will fund 
these efforts. Please describe the different purposes for which funds 
from different accounts will be used. Will CPIF funds be used in 
Europe?

    Answer. USAID's Bureau for Europe and Eurasia (E&E) helps enable 
our partner countries to make informed decisions regarding the People's 
Republic of China (PRC), understand the risks, and build the tools to 
mitigate these risks. We focus on building long-term resilience and the 
ability to respond to evolving and increasing foreign influence by the 
PRC. Our programming strengthens democratic governance and rule of law, 
resilience in the information space, independence and security of 
energy and infrastructure, and our partners' economic prosperity.
    E&E's programming addresses information manipulation in the E&E 
region by supporting our partner countries to identify and address 
narratives from the PRC, the Kremlin, and Iran that aim to build 
support for authoritarian values and governance models, while weakening 
democratic governments. Our programming also fosters economic 
environments that enable competition and fair and transparent 
investment environments, which in turn incentivizes trade and gives way 
to more opportunities and reduced dependence on predatory PRC loans and 
high risk PRC-funded digital infrastructure or services. To support 
these on-going, cross-cutting efforts, E&E's programming is primarily 
funded by Assistance to Europe, Eurasia, and Central Asia, but the 
region also receives targeted Countering PRC Influence Fund funding 
from economic support fund and development assistance funding accounts.

    Question. This budget request is once again very heavy on climate 
and gender programming. It says far less about China and strategic 
competition--which should be the top priority around which we determine 
our resourcing.
    In your view, how does a focus on climate and gender advance U.S. 
interests with respect to China and the threats it poses to the United 
States and our allies and partners?

    Answer. The security challenges around the Indo-Pacific region are 
inextricable from development challenges like food insecurity, global 
health security and the potential for new pandemics, economic 
fragility, weakening democratic systems--and increasingly, the grave 
security threat posed by climate change. As Secretary of Defense Austin 
said, ``no nation can find lasting security without addressing the 
climate crisis.'' Climate change fuels conflict, creates competition 
for resources, exacerbates food scarcity, disrupts economic stability 
and growth, and drives the displacement of tens of millions of people 
each year, which in turn has the potential to make people more 
vulnerable to exploitation and radicalization. USAID's work responds to 
the severe, high-priority concerns voiced by our allies and partners 
about climate change and its impacts. In order to address the 
priorities of our partner countries and reduce dependency on the PRC, 
USAID has worked to build new climate-finance partnerships to 
accelerate the flow of capital into climate change-related investments 
in partner countries, support climate-aligned infrastructure projects, 
and design activities promoting greater climate adaptation and 
mitigation.
    Our work on gender equality is a clear distinguishing factor 
between the United States and the People's Republic of China. USAID's 
focus on women's economic empowerment and the role of women in the 
economy writ-large, for example, contrasts significantly with the PRC's 
economic development model. McKinsey estimates that women's economic 
contributions could add up to $28 trillion to global GDP and $484 
billion to South Asia's GDP, if full gender parity in the workforce was 
reached. Yet an analysis of the thousands of Belt and Road Initiative 
projects across the world shows that empowering women economically is 
not part of the PRC development playbook. An analysis of the Chinese 
Development Finance Database collected by the AidData team at the 
College of William and Mary found only 91 women's development projects 
out of the entire data base of nearly 21,000 projects. These projects 
were mostly very small-scale, with a combined value of only $9 million, 
a tiny fraction of the over $1 trillion in commitments recorded in the 
data base. A 2021 publication by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce 
suggests that there have only been 60 projects since 2013 that empower 
women. The United States government and USAID, conversely, invest in 
women's economic empowerment and make the explicit case that supporting 
women in this regard enables more prosperity in our partner countries.
    Undertaking development work that accounts for women's rights and 
opportunities reflects our commitment to be responsive to the needs and 
priorities of local actors and communities--a commitment that stands in 
clear contrast to the PRC, and which creates a stronger foundation for 
U.S. partnerships and influence in the countries where we work. It also 
reflects a large body of evidence that ties gender equality to better 
development outcomes, such as improved food security and stronger 
economic growth. The visible difference--between the commitment of the 
U.S. to listen to partners and advance mutual interests, including on 
issues like women's economic empowerment, and the PRC's motivations of 
deepening trade and resource dependency with emerging economies--plays 
a major role in helping nurture relationships, deepening and expanding 
networks, and building goodwill toward the United States.
    Importantly, our work on issues such as addressing climate change 
and the challenges women face in their lives builds dignity--not by 
approaching development as a transaction, or as a means to an end--but 
by seeking to improve people's lives in ways that they can see and 
feel. This affirmative approach to international development and to 
advancing our nation's broader national security goals continues to 
distinguish the United States in critical ways from the PRC.

    Question. I agree that infrastructure is an important priority in 
the Indo-Pacific and globally, but it depends on how we do it.
    How does the $2 billion in mandatory funding requested for the 
Infrastructure Investment Fund and the $2 billion requested for the 
Indo-Pacific Strategy align with USAID's existing workstreams focused 
on competing with PRC investments in ``hard'' infrastructure? Why does 
this need to be mandatory?

    Answer. In response to the tremendous challenges and unprecedented 
opportunities we face in the Indo-Pacific, the fiscal year 2025 
President's Budget requests both mandatory and discretionary resources 
to out-compete China, strengthen the U.S. role in the Indo-Pacific, and 
advance American prosperity globally through new investments, including 
for infrastructure. Discretionary resources alone cannot meet this 
need. We have designed this mandatory package primarily as a vehicle to 
innovate new ways to support our allies and partners around the world 
by providing a viable alternative to the PRC's predatory and coercive 
practices and expanded presence, and offer alternatives at a scale that 
discretionary spending simply cannot meet. This mandatory funding would 
align with the existing infrastructure-adjacent work that USAID already 
implements, including the Countering PRC Influence Fund, DFC 
transaction support, support for MCC threshold programs, and economic 
growth and resilience-related programming.
    The mandatory package also provides us the ability to make longer-
term investments that complement and bolster our programming funded on 
the discretionary side. Mandatory funding is needed to enable us to 
make strategic programmatic investments over a longer time horizon. The 
mandatory proposal includes $4 billion that will enable the United 
States to invest in new ways to out-compete China and focus on the 
following new and critical investments to:

    <bullet> Create a new International Infrastructure Fund, which will 
out-compete China by providing a credible, reliable alternative to PRC 
options, while also expanding markets and opportunities for U.S. 
businesses. This fund will support transformative, quality, and 
sustainable ``hard'' infrastructure projects, including along strategic 
economic corridors.

    <bullet> Make game-changing investments in the Indo-Pacific to 
strengthen partner economies, bolster connectivity between partner 
countries, and support their efforts, including through multilateral 
fora, in pushing back against coercive actions.

    Question. Can you provide some specifics on what the ``new and 
innovative funding streams'' not currently funded through discretionary 
resources would look like?

    Answer. We are requesting $2 billion over 5 years to enable the 
United States to make significant investments in the Indo-Pacific to 
out-compete China. These investments will allow for new initiatives in 
strategic sectors that base discretionary funding alone cannot support. 
This funding will advance U.S. interests and leadership in the region 
and demonstrate our enduring commitment to our Indo-Pacific partners. 
We will support competitive connectivity in the Indo-Pacific, making 
Indo-Pacific economies more connected and resilient through 
transformative investments in emerging technologies, supply chains, and 
transportation, while also increasing opportunities for American 
businesses. These mandatory funds will allow us to work with our Indo-
Pacific partners to implement a robust regional approach to secure Open 
Radio Access Network (ORAN) digital technology and other secure, high-
standards technologies that provide like-minded alternatives to the 
PRC's predatory and coercive economic practices. Additionally, this 
funding will enable the United States to coordinate strategic 
investments with like-minded partners and incentivize lasting 
commitments from host governments that advance longer-term, deeper 
cooperation in countries most at risk of coercion and predatory 
influence. Funding would be authorized and appropriated to State and 
USAID (via the Economic Support Fund), with transfer authority to other 
agencies such as DFC, EXIM, and USTDA. In the Philippines, USAID's 
efforts to counter the negative influences of the PRC include a focus 
on the deployment of Open Radio Network Access (ORAN) so the 
Philippines and or other countries in the region have competitive 
options for mobile and internet technologies that are secure and 
transparent. We are preparing to conduct ORAN trials in partnership 
with the private sector in the near future to ultimately crowd in 
technology from the U.S. and like minded partners like Japan.

    Question. How does USAID measure success in competing with PRC 
``hard'' infrastructure investments?

    Answer. USAID has been able to achieve success competing with the 
PRC and other non-transparent actors in the infrastructure realm 
through programs, including Transaction Advisory Funds and legal 
support facilities, that increase open, transparent and private sector 
led procurement that deliver alternatives to the PRC's infrastructure 
offer to our partner countries. For example, these programs, including 
USAID's technical advisory services, successfully prevented PRC efforts 
to control the Port of Manzanillo in the Dominican Republic. USAID 
measures the results of our programs that support infrastructure deals 
that engage US-based or like minded partner companies and financing 
options through our Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning processes. 
These processes systematically collect and analyze information to 
support evidence-based decisionmaking, and generate learning to inform 
the adaptation of an activity based on evidence.

    Question. What portion of the $2 billion requested mandatory 
funding for ``programming aligned with the Partnership for Global 
Infrastructure and Investment'' will be going to USAID?

    Answer. This funding would be jointly managed by the State 
Department and USAID to support time-sensitive project design and 
provide advisory and delivery support to advance strategic 
infrastructure projects around the globe. The exact dollar amount of 
this split would be determined at a later point.

    Question. Are there specific projects, priorities, or initiatives 
that USAID expects to fund with this mandatory spending? In other 
words, please provide a list of things that you believe USAID cannot do 
today on infrastructure unless Congress approves mandatory spending.

    Answer. The International Infrastructure Fund mandatory request 
focuses on later-stage support for larger ``hard'' infrastructure 
projects that we cannot undertake within our current programming. These 
could build on support from the PGI Fund to catalyze greater investment 
in PGI-aligned strategic infrastructure projects. Mandatory funding is 
designed to support new and innovative ways to provide alternatives to 
PRC options, especially in international infrastructure and in the 
Indo-Pacific region. Through transfers to U.S. Government agencies such 
as USAID, MCC, USTDA, DFC, and EXIM, the mandatory Infrastructure Fund 
will support hard, strategic infrastructure projects, which could 
include investment in: critical mineral mining and processing; fiber, 
mobile, and wireless networks; subsea cables, landing stations, and 
data centers; ports, roads, and railroads; and water and sanitation 
infrastructure.

    Question. Please provide a list of all USAID projects affiliated 
with or branded as Project for Global Infrastructure and Investment 
(PGI) projects. Please provide the location, dollar figure, and a 
description of each such project.

    Answer. USAID engages in several ways to align, attribute, and 
directly fund projects and activities that support priority, identified 
Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI) economic 
corridors.

    ECONOMIC CORRIDORS--The following projects are aligned with and 
directly support the development of key economic corridors under PGI.

    Lobito Corridor--Angola

    <bullet> Building Infrastructure Capacity ($1 million). USAID will 
assist the Angolan Ministry of Transportation to develop their planned 
Public-Private Partnership Unit for transportation infrastructure. The 
support will enable the Ministry to replicate the successful and 
transparent Lobito Rail concession for additional rail and port 
investments.

    <bullet> Legal Equity and Equality for Angolan Women Farmers (LEE-
AWF) ($5.5 million). USAID will support agricultural development along 
the Lobito Corridor in Angola, focusing on linking female smallholder 
farmers to value chains that will use access to the rail line as a 
critical component of sustainability.

    <bullet> Digital Money Is Better ($4.875 million). USAID launched a 
digital money project with Africell, a U.S.-owned telecoms company, 
which will provide an equivalent in-kind contribution to the 
partnership on top of their existing mobile network.

    Luzon Corridor--Philippines

    <bullet> Energy Security and Independence Program ($3 million). 
Subject to congressional notification, USAID will work with the 
Philippine government to regain control of transmission development 
that is currently heavily controlled by the PRC and develop a nuclear 
energy policy framework to support U.S.-Philippines civil nuclear 
cooperation. These efforts will be funded through CPIF, and will be 
carried out through USAID's ongoing Energy Secure Philippines Activity.

    <bullet> Regulatory Reform Support Program for National Development 
(RESPOND). In March 2024, USAID's RESPOND activity signed an MoU with 
Clark International Airport Corporation (CIAC) to provide technical 
assistance to the CIAC in implementing programs and pursuing policies 
that seek to improve regulatory quality in the Philippines that can 
contribute to the Three-Year Food Logistics Agenda.

    OTHER GLOBAL PGI ACTIVITIES

    Additionally, the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 653(a) report transmitted 
to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and others in the summer of 
2023 included funding for a PGI Fund. State and USAID identified $30 
million to support implementation of identified PGI economic corridors. 
This money will be obligated to two long-standing USAID managed 
mechanisms: the Architecture & Engineering IDIQ (managed by USAID's 
Bureau for Resilience, Environment, and Food Security) and Trade 
Central Asia (managed by USAID's Central Asia Regional Mission). 
Pending resolution of existing congressional holds, we anticipate that 
these PGI activities will be used for quick release technical advisory 
support to remove discrete barriers to strategic infrastructure 
investments.
    Prosper Africa will use fiscal year 2023 funds to support PGI 
activities in Africa. Support will include project advisory services in 
the ``Lobito Corridor countries'' across sectors, such as agriculture, 
critical minerals, and information and communication technology. This 
work will enable other investments by the U.S. Government to mobilize 
private capital, including by the U.S. International Development 
Finance Corporation (DFC) and Export-Import Bank (Ex-im).
    Similar to Prosper Africa, Power Africa's fiscal year 2023 funds 
will support PGI activities across Sub-Saharan Africa. Funds will 
accelerate the development of generation, transmission and distribution 
infrastructure by facilitating specific projects to reach financial 
close and commissioning. Specific support will include project advisory 
and investor matchmaking services to the private sector, as well as 
training for and planning and policy development with African 
governments to improve the enabling environment for private sector 
energy investment. Work will also facilitate, and leverage investments 
and technical assistance provided by Power Africa interagency partners 
as well as bilateral and multilateral development partners.
    As a final note, USAID and the Department of State plan to 
attribute nearly $3.8 billion to the Partnership for Infrastructure and 
Investment in fiscal year 2023. These attributions will contribute to 
the United States goal of mobilizing $200 billion for the PGI by 2027 
through grants, Federal financing, and private sector investments under 
the broad sector pillars of PGI (gender, climate, digital, health and 
health security, and agriculture). These attributions reflect USAID 
programming that would have existed regardless of whether PGI was 
established or not, with much of this programming being planned prior 
to the development of PGI. This funding enables the United States to 
help meet the objective set out at the G7 Summit in 2022 to mobilize, 
with G7 partners and other like-minded partners, $600 billion in global 
infrastructure investments by 2027.

    Question. One of PGI's four pillars is gender. According to USAID, 
what qualifies as a gender-related infrastructure project?

    Answer. Under the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and 
Investment (PGI), the United States and its G7 partners identified four 
core pillars: digital connectivity, climate and climate security, 
health and health security, and gender. The G7 has committed to 
mobilizing $600 billion in financing by 2027 to achieve the goals of 
PGI. The United States will meet $200 billion of this by using grants 
and Federal financing to mobilize private sector investment.
    PGI builds on the long-standing U.S. approach to inclusive 
development ensuring that infrastructure investments support economic 
growth for all people, including women and girls. This approach stands 
in direct contrast to the one taken by the People's Republic of China 
and other strategic competitors. In practice, this means seeking to 
include gender as a design consideration, e.g., by designing projects 
to allow women and girls to benefit similarly to men and boys; combat 
gender-based violence risks; promote women's leadership and employment; 
address infrastructure challenges that disproportionately affect 
women's time use, ability to engage in productive work, or health and 
safety; and/or promote women's entrepreneurship in competition for and 
awarding of contracts. Examples of projects that can be pursued with a 
gender-alignment lens include but are not limited to the following:

    <bullet> Expanding mobile and internet access, including digital 
infrastructure projects that account for large gaps in access for women 
in many regions of the world (over a billion women in low- and middle-
income countries do not have access to mobile internet).

    <bullet> Expanding and improving water and sanitation 
infrastructure, as the majority of the burden for water collection 
around the world falls on women and girls, who spend 200 million hours 
every day collecting water. Reducing this time burden enables women and 
girls to participate in schooling, agriculture activities, work, and 
entrepreneurship, delivering clear economic benefits.

    <bullet> Care infrastructure, which is essential to advance women's 
economic security and that of their families.

             Responses of Ms. Samantha Power to Questions 
                     Submitted by Senator Tim Scott

    Question. Instability is rising around the world, leading to new 
conflicts and the risk for mass atrocities. According to the 2024 
annual report from the Early Warning Project at the U.S. Holocaust 
Memorial Museum, 30 countries are at risk for mass killings this year, 
half of which are in Sub-Saharan Africa.
    The President's fiscal year 2025 budget for USAID requests 
additional funding for Development Assistance above fiscal year 2023 
enacted levels to support atrocity prevention programming in key focus 
countries. Could you please provide a more detailed explanation on how 
these resources would be allocated, if provided?

    Answer. These funds would support analysis and resulting 
recommendations in countries at risk for atrocity events, especially 
countries not at imminent/immediate risk in which USAID would have time 
to pivot programming. For example, if analysis points to human rights 
defenders as a particularly vulnerable group, funds could be used to 
shore up protections of these individuals and their work.
    USAID works to detect, prevent, and respond to atrocities in four 
main ways.

    Recognize and communicate: Information and analysis about mass 
atrocities
    <bullet> This includes supporting early warning systems and both 
supporting and conducting research and analysis to determine localities 
at the most risk and the context-specific factors relevant to each 
situation as well as their trendlines.

    Prevent: Mitigating risks and bolstering resilience
    <bullet> A number of USAID focus areas are utilized to prevent 
atrocities, including (1) activities to prevent armed conflict 
outbreak, (2) activities that promote human rights, rule of law , and 
democratic governance, (3) activities that strengthen civil society and 
independent media, especially their ability to call attention to risk 
factors and warning signs, and (4) activities that build capacity and 
legitimacy of weak states.

    Respond: Limit consequences of atrocities
    <bullet> While atrocities are ongoing there are several approaches 
USAID takes to limit and mitigate their impact, such as (1) supporting 
mitigation or resolution of armed conflict, (2) providing and improving 
protection and support services for targeted groups in survivor-
centered and trauma-informed ways, (3) dissuading potential 
perpetrators, including through legal accountability, and (4) 
monitoring, documenting, and supporting advocacy to increase 
information about ongoing atrocities and to debunk atrocity related 
disinformation.

    Support recovery: Dealing with the aftermath of mass atrocities
    <bullet> In addition to the focus areas above that prevent the 
recurrence of mass atrocities, USAID works to: (1) support justice and 
accountability, (2) support psychological well-being, recovery, and 
reconciliation, (3) support political transition, and (4) support 
economic recovery, including through strengthened resilience to socio-
economic shocks.

    Question. Conflict prevention is an interagency task. How is USAID 
coordinating between various Federal partners to implement conflict 
prevention and stabilization programming in the field?

    Answer. USAID coordinates with other Federal partners using the 
principles of the Global Fragility Act of 2019 and the related U.S. 
Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability (SPCPS). SPCPS aims 
to use an integrated, whole-of-government approach to conflict 
prevention and stabilization that is evidence-based, innovative, long-
term, and locally driven. In four partner countries (Haiti, Libya, 
Mozambique, Papua New Guinea) and one region (Coastal West Africa--
Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Togo) USAID worked with the 
Department of State, Department of Defense, and other departments and 
agencies in the field to develop 10-year country or regional plans that 
aim to leverage the full range of U.S. Government (USG) tools across 
new and existing diplomatic, defense, and development efforts while 
also deepening partnerships with like-minded countries, multilaterals, 
and civil society. USAID Missions also work with the full Country Team 
at Embassies to address conflict prevention and stabilization through 
Integrated Country Strategies, Country Development Cooperation 
Strategies, and other strategies. In addition, USAID coordinates with 
the interagency to implement the Administration's Women, Peace and 
Security Action Plan and to identify and address atrocity risk factors, 
early and late warning signs, and options for USG programming in 
countries at high risk for atrocities.
    As an example, USAID's Peace Action for Rapid and Transformative 
Nigerian Early Response (PARTNER) activity (2021-2026) helps Nigerian 
communities, government, security, and civil society actors to 
collaborate more effectively with each other and the USG interagency in 
order to increase the effectiveness, local ownership, and 
sustainability of an inclusive early warning early response system to 
prevent violent conflict in Nigeria.

    Question. In December, Secretary Blinken issued an atrocities 
determination on the conflict in Sudan, but he stopped short of 
designating the crisis in Darfur as a genocide. Several of my 
colleagues and I disagree with this assessment. How is USAID monitoring 
the ongoing atrocities in Darfur? What tools and technologies are being 
used to monitor the situation in real time?

    Answer. Secretary Blinken's determination of war crimes, crimes 
against humanity, and ethnic cleansing committed against the Sudanese 
people is a necessary step toward accountability for survivors and 
victims of this and previous conflicts in Sudan. The Secretary's 
Atrocity Determination does not prevent further such determinations in 
the future about other international crimes, including genocide. USAID 
and other parts of the interagency continue to monitor the crisis 
through a variety of means. One such example that has provided 
tremendous insight into the ongoing atrocities is the Sudan Conflict 
Observatory, which uses commercial satellite imagery and open-source 
data analysis to report on the ongoing horrors in Darfur and across 
Sudan. Additionally, we regularly receive reports from trusted partners 
that are still able to report on the events on the ground due to 
continued and heroic local presence. The United States has imposed 
costs on individuals and entities escalating the conflict and 
committing atrocities, and we will continue to increase pressure on 
Sudanese and external actors who stand in the way of good faith 
negotiation.
