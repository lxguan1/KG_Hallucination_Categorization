 STATEMENT OF HON. TINA SMITH, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF 
                           MINNESOTA

    Senator Smith. Good afternoon, everyone. I call to order 
the Subcommittee on Commodities, Risk Management, and Trade. 
Senator Hyde-Smith, a big thanks to you and your staff for 
working together with me to organize this hearing today. I know 
that Chair Stabenow and Ranking Member Boozman are going to be 
joining us shortly, and I am also grateful to them and their 
staffs for our work putting this together, and we appreciate 
their leadership very much. Thanks all the members of the 
Subcommittee, as well.
    Our hearing this afternoon is going to focus on how 
Congress can help support the next generation of farmers, 
really this generation of farmers. According to the most recent 
Census of Agriculture, the average age of a producer in the 
United States is now around 58, and, of course, this number is 
only going to get higher.
    This, in a nutshell, is why we need to invest in the next 
generation of farmers, so that this country's agricultural 
sector continues to work. This is a matter of national 
security, of food security, and the strength and vitality of 
rural America.
    Agriculture is a driving force in Minnesota's economy and 
in America's economy. This is true not just in rural places but 
also in urban areas and suburban communities. It is also true 
that the agricultural sector faces challenges right now, and 
nobody feels the ups and downs of farming more than producers 
just starting out.
    It can take years to establish yourself as a farmer, to 
find affordable and productive land, to establish a line of 
credit with a lender, and to develop and maintain a market for 
your products.
    From rising input costs, changing climate and weather 
variability, to market consolidation that results in fewer 
options for processing and fewer avenues to market, many 
beginning farmers struggle to turn a profit. Today most small 
and beginning farmers close the financial gap with at least 
one, and often more than one, off-farm jobs.
    Yet beginning farmers are some of the hardest working, 
innovative, entrepreneurial, and optimistic people that I know. 
What they tell me is that Federal farm programs need to work 
for them too.
    Here is an example. The number one challenge I hear about 
from beginning farmers is finding productive, affordable land, 
and that means access to cash and lending to buy or rent. The 
reasons for the high cost of farmland are complicated, of 
course. Many farmers today are holding onto their land longer. 
Farmland is consolidating into bigger and bigger operations, or 
some land is being turned into residential and commercial 
developments. This is lowering the supply of land and driving 
up prices.
    According to the Economic Research Service at the USDA, 
just 33 percent of beginning farmers and ranchers receive 
assistance from USDA programs, compared to 41 percent of 
established farms. Why is this happening? Again, the reasons 
are complex, but a big one is that beginning farmers face a lot 
of challenges finding farmland with base acres, so it is 
challenging for them to use the USDA commodity safety net.
    An October 2023 study from the Food and Agriculture Policy 
Research Institute found that a 10 percent increase to the 
Price Loss Coverage program--which is a program that helps 
farmers facing a substantial drop in crop prices or revenue--
that a 10 percent increase in the PLC would result in hundreds 
of millions of taxpayer dollars going into the pockets of 
landlords and investors, not farmers. Commodity programs are 
intended to be a risk management tool for active farmers.
    To add to the challenge for beginning farmers, base acre 
payments have the primary effect of increasing land prices. 
Land that is counted as base acres by the commodity programs is 
more expensive to purchase and more costly to rent. Today, more 
than 50 percent of cropland across the country is rented, not 
owned by actual farmers doing the hard work of planting and 
harvesting, while also working to support their families. 
Beginning farmers often have only one choice, either renting 
cheaper and less productive land that does not have a base acre 
designation, which results in less support from the Federal 
Government. Sometimes it feels, I think, like they are getting 
hit coming and going.
    I know that the issue of reference prices and base acres 
are very much on the mind of our Chair and Ranking Member, and 
I am grateful to Chair Stabenow for laying out a sensible farm 
bill framework that will support beginning farmers as they get 
started and as they operate their businesses day to day. I am 
looking forward to a conversation about what we can do to 
update the base acre formula so that it reflects current 
planting realities, not planting decisions made more than 40 
years ago.
    There are many other things that this Committee is working 
on to help beginning farmers. I have worked closely with the 
National Young Farmers Coalition on crafting the Increasing 
Land Access, Security, and Opportunities Act (LASO). This bill 
would directly help beginning farmers and historically 
underserved farmers acquire affordable land, develop markets, 
and get access to capital. I also worked closely with Chair 
Stabenow and the entire Agriculture Committee to update the 
Farming Opportunities Training and Outreach Grant Program--that 
is a mouthful. What it does is it helps coordinate training and 
outreach for emerging farmers and veteran farmers and 
historically disadvantaged farmers by allowing for better 
partnerships with known and trusted groups on the ground. In 
Minnesota this is very valuable, organizations like The Good 
Acre, the Hmong American Partnership, the Latino Economic 
Development Center, and Renewing the Countryside, among many.
    I know that many of my colleagues on this Committee also 
have proposals to support beginning farmers and that we will be 
highlighting that today during this hearing. Our diverse panel 
today will provide the Subcommittee with a better understanding 
of the issues facing beginning farmers as you work so hard to 
stand up and then operate successful farming operations. We 
really appreciate you all being here today to share your 
stories and your experience, and I know that your presence here 
today will help to inform the Subcommittee and the full 
Committee as we work toward a bipartisan farm bill and as we 
consider how best to support our country's beginning farmers.
    I would like to welcome Chair Stabenow and Ranking Member 
Boozman, and I will turn now to my Ranking Member, Senator 
Hyde-Smith, and then would welcome the opportunity for Chair 
Stabenow and Ranking Member Boozman to make opening remarks, if 
you choose.
    Senator Hyde-Smith, thank you.

STATEMENT OF HON. CINDY HYDE-SMITH, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE 
                         OF MISSISSIPPI

    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you so much, Chairwoman Smith, 
and thank you to our witnesses for traveling and getting here 
to give us real-life stories of the real challenges. We 
celebrate a lot of successes, but we realize that in reality 
there are so many challenges, as well.
    As Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, I am just pleased to 
be a part of things like this, to ensure that the two percent 
of us who feed the other 98 percent, that we continue to grow. 
Throughout my time in the Senate I have loved working with Farm 
Bureau, with FFA, with young folks who come in, and they say, 
``I want to get into agriculture.'' Sometimes they were not 
born into agriculture, and they have to go and find land or 
find opportunities. As I was just speaking down there, ag 
lending is such an opportunity, and we have to look around 
because everybody plays a role to make this thing work and to 
keep the train on the track.
    You are just such a breath of fresh air--young, resilient 
farmers who are willing to come, willing to sit in here and put 
up with these members, these politicians, and thinking, ``Oh my 
goodness. What are they going to ask me?'' You will always 
remember this day, too. America needs you. We need you on this 
Committee. Thank you for the willingness, and thank you for the 
sacrifices that you are willing to make to continue in 
production agriculture, because we know it is not always easy. 
We always need to be thinking about how to ensure a bright 
future for you and because of those who want to get into this 
business.
    Today we get to hear from young and beginning farmers and 
directly to understand your unique perspective, because your 
perspective matters. This is your Capitol. We represent our 
States. We represent you. It is so incredibly important that 
you come and give us these honest discussions of exactly what 
is happening.
    I am grateful we have a witness here today from Farm 
Credit, which is charged by Congress to serve creditworthy 
young, beginning, small farmers. I say all the time, finance is 
what makes the world go around. Our three Mississippi Farm 
Credit institutions are First South Farm Credit, Mississippi 
Land Bank, and Southern Ag Credit. They do so much to help the 
next generation. We know that is a necessity. They also award 
thousands of dollars in scholarships each year to students 
studying agriculture, and sponsor events like the Young Farmer 
and Rancher Conferences as well as the 4-H and FFA events.
    I truly look forward to hearing from you and the incredible 
opportunity that lies in front of you, right in front of us, to 
support young and beginning farmers. That is our job, to pass a 
strong farm bill and to make sure that those opportunities 
continue to exist for you and so many others just like you.
    I commend the House Ag Committee for favorably reporting a 
robust farm bill that modernizes the farm safety net, including 
multiple provisions beneficial to young and beginning farmers. 
I just look forward to working with my colleagues. I will 
continue to stand to emphasize the need for more farm in the 
farm bill, whether we are talking about young and beginning or 
old, experienced farmers, like my husband and I. This is why 
the farm safety net authorized in Titles I and XI of the farm 
bill, is so critical, and why I am so dedicated to ensuring 
that a new farm bill modernizes the safety net to keep up with 
today's challenges, like skyrocketing input costs, interest 
rates. We know when you have to borrow money to buy big, 
expensive equipment, when that interest rate goes up, that can 
be a game-changer in so many operations, and it can determine 
whether you can continue to do this or not.
    I am so grateful for you and I look forward to hearing from 
you. Please stay in agriculture, and please bring others along 
with you, and hold us accountable and responsible for making 
sure that that pathway is obtainable for you. Write those 
letters. Make those calls to make sure everybody on this 
Committee and on this Subcommittee are aware of the needs out 
there and that we are doing our part to help young American 
farmers just like yourselves. Thank you.
    Senator Smith. Thank you so much. Now I will defer to Chair 
Stabenow for some opening remarks, if you would like.

STATEMENT OF HON. DEBBIE STABENOW, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE 
    OF MICHIGAN, CHAIRWOMAN, U.S. COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, 
                    NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY

    Chairwoman Stabenow. Well, thank you very much, Chairwoman 
Smith and Ranking Member Hyde-Smith. This is such an important 
hearing, and thank you both for your leadership and bringing us 
together. Yes, as Senator Hyde-Smith said, we want you in 
farming. We want you to have the opportunity to get into 
farming, to be able to stay, and I know this is something that 
everybody on the Committee cares about.
    While the average age of Americans farmers has been on the 
rise, as we all know, the number of new and beginning farmers 
has been increasing, as well. Nearly one-third of all producers 
are beginning farmers. The problem, in addition to attracting 
new farmers, as I know all of you know, is getting them the 
support and removing the barriers that are keeping them from 
long-term success.
    There are differences. There are things that work for big 
enterprises, there are things that work for established farms, 
that do not create opportunity for you. It is really important 
that we be focused on your needs.
    The future of American agriculture and the strength of our 
agricultural economy depends on the long-term success of young, 
beginning farmers, and ranchers as well. However, new and 
beginning farmers often face what we have already heard, 
significant barriers to entering the agricultural economy, and 
are left with less support from the safety net than established 
farmers. That is a reality today that we need to fix. Almost 
half of beginning farmers receive the majority of their 
household income from off-the-farm employment.
    For example, let's talk about one policy that Chair Smith 
talked about, land with base acres in the commodity program is 
more expensive to purchase. It is more valuable because it 
comes with a payment. It is more expensive to purchase and 
costlier to rent. Beginning farmers often lack the necessary 
capital to access this land and are forced onto land that does 
not have the automatic payment under base acres, which means 
they do not have base acres. So they do not qualify for the 
current commodity programs through ARC and PLC that we keep 
discussing.
    The House proposal to increase these programs by 70 
percent--extraordinary 70 percent increase in payments--and 
relax and remove payment and eligibility limits for the biggest 
farms, will make land rents even more unaffordable for 
beginning farmers, making access even more challenging. I think 
that is something we really have to discuss.
    Making crop insurance more affordable and accessible is a 
much more effective way to help farmers, and it does not depend 
on what you planted back in the 1980's to be able to get 
support. It covers what the producer is actually growing.
    Other barriers include challenges accessing necessary 
capital, financing, technical assistance, hands-on training, 
and risk management tools that you need to succeed. I know for 
many of our farmers and ranchers the pathway into the 
agricultural economy actually starts--as it does in my State--
with small fruit and vegetable or livestock operations.
    The success of these farms often depends on consistent 
access to local markets as well as international markets--local 
markets--that provide fresh local product directly to 
consumers, restaurants, and small businesses in the community. 
This is an economic model that depends on strong support for 
specialty crops. By the way, this is an important area of 
commonality in the House and Senate bill, focusing on crop 
insurance. There are many provisions there that we agree on, so 
it is a great place to start.
    At the same time, a focus on local and regional supply 
chains, and technical assistance to navigate Federal programs 
and target solutions. Last month I unveiled our Rural 
Prosperity and Food Security Act, which makes significant 
investments in the next generation of agriculture 
professionals, whether they are on the farm, in the lab, or in 
the boardroom. The proposal incorporates more than 100 
bipartisan provisions, and is aimed at expanding the reach of 
our farm safety net for all producers. It provides an 
opportunity for training and education, opens new pathways to 
getting started, ensures that risk management tools meet the 
needs of new and beginning farmers.
    It makes several improvements to lower the barriers to 
credit. It provides the first expansion of the commodity 
programs, ARC and PLC access, in more than 20 years, by 
providing an opportunity for beginning farmers to use these 
programs through targeted base acres established. To get into 
the program, which is not what is happening right now. Crop 
insurance, making it more affordable, dealing with a number of 
different issues.
    This is a strong bill for new and beginning farmers and 
ranchers. Madam Chair, I would ask unanimous consent that the 
document highlighting the provisions for new and beginning 
farmers be included in the record.
    Senator Smith. Without objection.

    [The document can be found on page 60 in the appendix.]

    Chairwoman Stabenow. I would appreciate that. I want to 
thank you again, both of the leaders of this Subcommittee. I 
know that we can build on bipartisan cooperation and finish a 
2024 Farm Bill. It is so critical that the path maintain the 
long tradition of respecting the needs and interests of the 
broad farm and food coalition. That is how we get it done. That 
is the foundation for a successful farm bill. I look forward to 
working with you to get that done. Thank you.
    Senator Smith. Thank you so much, Madam Chair.
    I look forward to hearing from Senator Boozman when he 
returns, but in the meantime I believe we will start with 
hearing testimony from our witnesses. I will start with 
introducing Ms. Parks and Ms. Sattazahn, and then Senator Hyde-
Smith will introduce the next two witnesses.
    Ms. Tessa Parks is a farmer and co-owner of W.T. Farms in 
Northfield, Minnesota. Tessa is a first-generation, half-
Japanese Filipino farmer who co-owns and operates a beef and 
certified organic hay operation with her spouse, Wyatt, on 
rented farmland in Northfield. Tessa is the newly elected 
President of the Rice County Chapter of the Minnesota Farmers 
Union. As part of the Sharing Our Roots farm commons cohort 
since 2021, Tessa and Wyatt rotationally graze Holstein steers 
to improve soil health and provide quality beef directly to 
consumers. In addition to being involved in Minnesota's Farmers 
Union and the National Farmers Union, Tessa is an active member 
of the Land Stewardship Project and the National Young Farmers 
Coalition.
    Off-farm, Tessa works as an organic certification 
specialist and inspector at the Minnesota Crop Improvement 
Association.
    Welcome, Tessa.
    I would now like to welcome Raechel Sattazahn, who is 
Director of Industry and Membership Relations for Horizon Farm 
Credit in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. Horizon Farm Credit 
services 22,000 members across 100 counties in Delaware, 
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. In her 
role, Raechel oversees Horizon's strategic industry 
relationships, member education, and young and beginning farmer 
efforts.
    Raechel grew up on a small dairy farm in south central 
Pennsylvania and is now involved in her husband's dairy farm in 
Womelsdorf, Pennsylvania. Thank you. Welcome.
    I will turn to Senator Hyde-Smith for introducing the next 
two witnesses.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you for this opportunity. What a 
cool name is Christian Good. It is my pleasure to introduce 
him, a corn and soybean producer from Macon, Mississippi. Mr. 
Good graduated from Mississippi State University in 2016, and 
shortly afterward set out to establish his own operation. He is 
involved with the Mississippi Farm Bureau Federation, American 
Soybean Association, and the United Soybean Board.
    I am grateful we have Mr. Good here to lend valuable 
insights into challenges faced by Mississippi farmers and young 
farmers nationwide. Mr. Good lives on his farm with his wife, 
Laura, and two children. We certainly want to welcome you.
    What are those children's names?
    Mr. Good. Caleb and Peter.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Caleb and Peter. I didn't have that in 
there. Well, we certainly welcome you, and I look forward to 
hearing your testimony.
    Now I get to introduce Mr. Kevin Lussier, the Chair of the 
American Farm Bureau Federation Young Farmers and Ranchers 
Committee. Mr. Lussier is a graduate of Jacksonville 
University, and started a 300-cow dairy farm and creamery with 
his wife, Shelby, in 2020. They sell handcrafted cheese and 
also run a commercial cow-calf herd. Mr. Lussier has been 
involved in his county Farm Bureau and Florida Farm Bureau, and 
lives in Hawthorne, Florida, with his wife and family.
    Thank you for being here, as well, and that is a whole lot 
like work, what I just read. Thank you.
    Senator Smith. Thank you so much.
    Before we turn to our witnesses I want to give an 
opportunity to Ranking Member Boozman. If you would like to 
speak we would welcome it.

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BOOZMAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF 
                            ARKANSAS

    Senator Boozman. Well, I am really anxious to hear the 
witnesses so I am going to submit my statement into the record. 
I want to thank you two, the Chair and Ranking Member, for 
bringing this forward, and then again we have got the big Chair 
here, Senator Stabenow.
    We are in a situation where we have a lot of important 
hearings here, but I don't know that we are going to have any 
more important than the topic that we are discussing today. It 
is not only important now, but it is so important for the 
future of agriculture.
    Thank you all for pushing forward so that we might have 
this hearing.
    Senator Smith. Thank you so much. That is great.
    Let's see. Just to keep it simple we will start with Mr. 
Good, and then we will go down the panel. Please begin, and we 
look forward to your remarks. Please try to keep your remarks 
to roughly five minutes.

  STATEMENT OF CHRISTIAN GOOD, OWNER/OPERATOR, CHRISTIAN GOOD 
                        FARMS, MACON, MS

    Mr. Good. Madam Chair, Ranking Member Hyde-Smith, and other 
distinguished members of the Subcommittee, thank you for 
calling this hearing today to discuss this important topic and 
for allowing me to testify. Again, my name is Christian Good, 
and I am owner/operator of Christian Good Farms in Macon, 
Mississippi.
    Since my childhood, I have always been involved in our 
family farm in Noxubee County, raising corn, soybeans, cotton, 
beef cattle, and catfish. After graduating high school, I went 
to Mississippi State University to get my Bachelor of Science 
in Agribusiness. Although I grew up in agriculture, I 
established my own operation shortly after college. In 2020, my 
wife Laura and I had the opportunity to purchase our first 
farmland tract of around 125 acres with financing through the 
Farm Credit System. We have expanded to over 300 acres of corn 
and soybean production through long-term land leases.
    Farming in today's overall economic environment poses some 
real challenges for both beginning and experienced farmers. My 
fellow Mississippi farmers are facing one of the most difficult 
years in quite some time. First and foremost, our operating 
costs are at an all-time high. Inflated costs for seed, 
fertilizer, fuel, technology, equipment, and parts and repair 
costs continue to erode the profit headwinds for producers, 
both young and old. Most farmers in our community made one of 
the best crops they have ever produced in 2023, and due to 
these record input costs, many still lost money.
    Second, the markets for the commodities that my farm 
produces are currently in a significant price downturn, yet are 
above the statutory reference prices established in the 2018 
Farm Bill. In just two years, we have seen the market price for 
corn drop $2.40 per bushel, or roughly 35 percent. The same can 
be said for the soybean market that has dropped roughly 18 
percent.
    The third economic challenge that all of us are facing is 
the rising level of interest rates on our farm operating loans. 
Just four years ago, interest rates on farmland real estate 
loans and farm production loans were between three and four 
percent. Now, the same interest rates stand between eight and 
nine percent, more than doubling the cost of borrowing for 
agricultural producers. The current interest rate environment 
is a substantial roadblock to many producers to expand their 
operation as needed, and is certainly a challenge to many young 
and beginning farmers and ranchers like myself.
    Finally, as we kick off the 2024 crop season, the lack of 
meaningful safety net that our current farm bill provides is a 
real concern for farmers in my community. The farm generally 
participates in the Price Loss Coverage, PLC, program provided 
by the USDA Farm Service Agency, designed to provide a price 
floor that we receive. The statutory reference prices in the 
2018 Farm Bill are so outdated that I can confidently say that 
if I were to receive those prices for corn and for soybeans, my 
farm and my family's farm would be out of business.
    I highlight these challenges to provide some context into 
the importance of Congress passing a strong farm bill in 2024 
for the future of all farmers, especially those beginning young 
farmers.
    I would like to now give you my perspective of the some of 
the numerous challenges that young and beginning farmers face 
in my State with farm bill programs, and provide you with some 
recommendations to address some of these concerns.
    One challenge on my farm is having an adequate amount of 
base acres to allow for me to enroll in FSA Price Loss Coverage 
Option program or other Title I risk management programs. My 
farm is roughly two-third based. My recommendation would be to 
devise some way for young producers to build base without 
adopting a policy for mandatory base updates.
    The House Agriculture Committee just recently marked up a 
farm bill provision that will allow producers a one-time option 
of building base on their current farming operation. For young 
farmers this change would be monumental. Additionally, the 
House bill makes significant adjustments to the statutory 
reference prices for most commodities, bringing them more in 
line with today's market situation.
    Many young and beginning farmers in my State utilize the 
Farm Service Agency loan programs. These programs are designed 
to assist young producers with limited resources and assets to 
get started farming. My experience and that of others in my 
community has been that these programs are overly cumbersome, 
complicated, and require too much time to complete an 
application. My recommendation would be to simplify and 
streamline the application process.
    Additionally, the direct and guaranteed loan limits should 
certainly be raised. The bipartisan PACE Act, introduced by 
Senators Klobuchar and Hoeven, makes sweeping adjustments to 
these USDA direct and guaranteed loan programs to make them 
more effective and responsive to farmers and ranchers.
    Crop insurance is also a vital tool used by young farmers 
and ranchers, but the premium costs for adequate coverage is a 
real challenge for young farmers. The bipartisan Crop Insurance 
for Future Farmers Act of 2023, introduced by Senators 
Klobuchar and Thune, extends the eligibility period from 5 
years to 10 years, for beginning farmers and ranchers, thus 
lowering their cost for crop insurance coverage.
    In closing, thank you for the opportunity to testify before 
you today. In my view, the most important thing Congress can do 
is to help the next generation of farmers by passing a robust 
farm bill that strengthens the farm safety net and improves 
access to credit, risk management tools, and voluntary 
conservation programs.
    I look forward to working with you today to create a strong 
farm bill that provides sound policy for young and beginning 
farmers like me, and I stand ready to answer any questions that 
you may have.

    Senator Smith. Thank you very much.
    We will now turn to Ms. Parks.

STATEMENT OF TESSA PARKS, FARMER, W.T. FARMS, NATIONAL FARMERS 
                     UNION, NORTHFIELD, MN

    Ms. Parks. Chair Smith, Ranking Member Hyde-Smith, and 
members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the invitation to 
testify.
    My name is Tessa Sadae Parks, and I am a beginning farmer 
in Northfield, Minnesota. My spouse Wyatt and I own and operate 
W.T. Farms, raising grass-finished beef and certified organic 
hay, which we sell direct to consumer. I am a member of 
National Farmers Union, and President of the Rice County 
Chapter of Minnesota Farmers Union. I am also active in the 
National Young Farmers Coalition and Land Stewardship Project.
    Farmers Union is general farm organization advocating for 
the economic prosperity of family farmers, ranchers, and their 
communities. Our grassroots policy recognizes the importance of 
putting sound policy in place to support the next generation of 
farmers who will produce the food, fiber, and fuel we need for 
our security and the health of our fellow citizens.
    Beginning farmers like me face significant barriers to 
entry into agriculture. The farm safety net favors larger and 
more established farms. Land is expensive, and capital is 
difficult to access. Climate change makes farming more risky, 
and ongoing corporate consolidation limits our access to a fair 
and open market.
    Before I dive into the issues further I wanted to share a 
bit more about myself, my family, and our farm. Though I am 
several generations removed from the farm, my connection to 
agriculture is strong. On my mother's side, our family farmed 
rice in Japan before immigrating to Hawaii where they were rice 
and pineapple farmers. In one sense, I see myself as a new or 
beginning farmer, but I also see myself as returning to the 
land.
    After I met Wyatt, who was already farming at the time, I 
became increasingly involved in agriculture. The shared 
experience of building a farm with Wyatt brings me great joy, 
but we also face many challenges. It is exciting to grow our 
businesses, adding 100 more acres of hay and buying our first 
tractor this year. We cannot afford land of our own, and our 
access to markets is uncertain.
    A program that might have helped us get a better start and 
that could help support many other beginning and underserved 
farmers in the future, if expanded, if USDA's Increasing Land 
Capital and Market Access Program. Senator Smith's Land Access, 
Security, and Opportunities Act (LASO), would reauthorize and 
improve this new USDA program, which takes a locally led, 
community-based approach to helping beginning and underserved 
farmers succeed. I hope LASO will be in the next farm bill.
    Managing risks on our farm is important to us, especially 
considering the impacts of climate change. Using conservation 
practices helps us do our part to tackle climate change and 
build resilience. We are glad to see there is bipartisan 
support for including the Inflation Reduction Act funding for 
USDA's Voluntary Conservation Programs in the farm bill.
    We know that crop insurance is an important risk management 
tool for many farmers, but it has been difficult to find the 
right fit for our farm. We have kept records for several years 
to prepare to purchase a whole-farm revenue protection policy, 
but it still does not work for us. The inclusion in Chairwoman 
Stabenow's farm bill framework of additional options in the 
Non-Insured Crop Disaster Assistance Program, NAP, including 
through a whole-farm concept, is encouraging, but more must be 
done to ensure all types of farms, especially so that smaller 
and more diversified farms can access crop insurance.
    As important as crop insurance is for many of our 
neighbors, we worry that the program lacks limits. Crop 
insurance is known to increase land values, which makes it more 
difficult to us and other beginning farmers to afford land. The 
crop insurance program supports farms that need the most help 
while avoiding providing excessive protection to the farms that 
need it the least.
    Another barrier to longer term success for many new or 
beginning farmers is that they often operate on land that does 
not have program base acres. The farm bill should provide ways 
to establish new base acres, especially for beginning farmers, 
which would provide greater financial stability for producers 
like me.
    The root causes of the financial instability our farm faces 
are the monopolies that dominate agricultural markets. Our 
dreams of building a successful will not be possible if we 
can't get a fair price for our cattle and access to affordable 
inputs. That is why I am proud of the Fairness for Farmers 
campaign and that Farmers Union is standing up for fair and 
competitive markets in this farm bill debate. We appreciate the 
competition provisions in Chairwoman Stabenow's framework, 
including the Meat and Poultry Special Investigator Act, to 
strengthen Packers and Stockyards Act enforcement.
    We need to make sure other Fairness for Farmers priorities 
are added to the farm bill in order to improve market price 
discovery and transparency, reestablish mandatory country of 
origin labeling for beef, and give farmers the Right to Repair 
their farm equipment. I also urge the Committee to reject any 
provisions that create loopholes that weaken the Packers and 
Stockyards Act.
    The solutions I talked about will not be as effective in 
helping the next generation of farmers if we do not ensure 
access to affordable health and childcare in rural areas. Like 
many farm households, we have found it difficult to afford 
health care without working off-farm jobs, but the off-farm 
work means we have had less time to invest in our farm 
business. Lack of access to affordable health and childcare 
means we may need to choose between farming and starting a 
family. We appreciate the provisions from the Expanding Child 
Care in Rural America Act in Chairwoman Stabenow's farm bill 
framework.
    It has been an honor to share my experience as a beginning 
farmer with you in the ongoing farm bill debate. Passing a good 
farm bill, the right farm bill, can only be done by building a 
broad and strong coalition of support through addition, not 
division. The right farm bill is not only one that establishes 
a sound foundation for beginning farmers like me, but for all 
of our rural, suburban, and urban neighbors, one that improves 
the farm safety net, takes climate change head-on, and that 
ensures food and nutrition security for all.
    I look forward to any questions you may have. Thank you 
again for the opportunity to testify.

    [The prepared statement of Ms. Parks can be found on page 
40 in the appendix.]

    Senator Smith. Thank you very much.
    Now we will turn to Mr. Lussier.

 STATEMENT OF KEVIN LUSSIER, CHAIR, YOUNG FARMERS AND RANCHERS 
   COMMITTEE, AMERICAN FARM BUREAU FEDERATION, HAWTHORNE, FL

    Mr. Lussier. Thank you. Chairwoman Smith, Ranking Member 
Hyde-Smith, and distinguished members of the Committee, my name 
is Kevin Lussier, and I am a third-generation dairy farmer from 
Hawthorne, Florida. I am here with my wife and partner in my 
operation, Shelby.
    I am honored to be here today to share my experiences and 
to advocate for the programs that are vital to the survival and 
success of young farmers like me. I also want to make clear how 
imperative it is that Congress pass a bipartisan farm bill this 
year.
    Today's hearing focuses on helping the next generation of 
farmers. If we do not give young farmers the certainty of a 
five-year modernized safety net, young farmers will be less 
likely to go into the business of producing the food, fuel, and 
fiber that our country and national security depend on.
    When I returned home from college in 2016, I stepped into 
management of our family farm. In 2017, I was able to take 
advantage of the Farm Service Agency Young Farmer Program and 
purchase 100 dairy cattle and 35 acres of cropland. With the 
dairy industry in the middle of its worst downturn in history, 
we decided we had to either grow or diversify if we were going 
to sustain our farm business.
    In 2019, we went back to the FSA and secured another loan 
to purchase 100 additional head of Jersey cattle and cheese-
making equipment to help us begin our artisan creamery. We also 
utilized the Value-Added Producer Grant through USDA Rural 
Development to help market our cheese. We are now milking 300 
head of Jersey cows.
    Dairy farming is not just a job for me; it is a way of 
life, a heritage that I am proud to carry forward and one that 
I hope to pass on to my own children one day. However, the 
challenges facing young farmers today are daunting, and without 
adequate support and creativity from producers, the future of 
American dairy farming and other small family farms like mine, 
is at risk.
    Access to credit is one of the most critical issues young 
and beginning farmers face. Inflation continues to raise supply 
costs, and the price of agricultural land is skyrocketing. 
Starting and maintaining a dairy farm requires significant 
capital investment, from purchasing land and equipment to 
acquiring livestock and feed. Traditional lending institutions 
often view agriculture as a high-risk industry. When you 
combine that with the limited or zero credit history many young 
farmers and ranchers have, it makes it difficult for them to 
secure loans through private lending institutions on favorable 
terms.
    Programs like the FSA's Guaranteed and Direct Farm 
Ownership and Operating Loans have been invaluable to the 
success of our farm and to many other young farmers and 
ranchers. Increasing the lending limits for these programs to 
more accurately reflect the costs of production agriculture in 
today's world would enable more young farmers to access the 
credit they need to start and sustain their operations.
    Dairy farmers face unique challenges related to market 
volatility and pricing. Programs that offer price support and 
risk management tools, such as the Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC), 
program provide a safety net that can make the difference 
between staying in business and shutting down. Strengthening 
and expanding the DMC program will help young dairy farmers, 
like myself, manage the inherent risks in agriculture and 
ensure a more stable, predictable income.
    Modifications to DMC will better allow our business to 
manage financial risk. Modifications the Committee should 
consider as it works toward a farm bill include increasing the 
cap on Tier 1 coverage for DMC above five million pounds. The 
House farm bill increased it to six million pounds, but moving 
the cap closer to 10 million would allow for more producers to 
benefit. For example, our farm milks roughly 300 head of 
Jerseys, which is right near the current cap. Should we choose 
to grow our business by adding cows, we would exceed the five 
million pound cap, leaving part of the business with no safety 
net.
    Other positive enhancements that were included in the House 
bill include updating DMC production history, providing a 
premium discount for those producers who choose to enroll in 
DMC for the life of the farm bill, and restoring the ``higher 
of'' formula for the class one mover. The market disruptions 
seen in the last five years due to the change in milk pricing 
formula have created huge losses to our dairy farmers. In fact, 
my family farm alone has lost more than $230,000 when you 
compare today's pricing formula to the ``higher of.'' We have 
continued to see losses in the first four months of 2024, and I 
believe this change is imperative when addressing the 
sustainability of the American dairy farmer.
    Additionally, Farm Bureau members like me have expressed 
concern over the limited availability of childcare centers and 
the distance to get to a childcare facility. In order to keep 
young and beginning farmers on the farm, it is extremely 
important to have affordable childcare in rural areas. I thank 
Chairwoman Smith for supporting the Expanding Childcare in 
Rural America Act. I hope we can see this bill included in the 
farm bill.
    The future of American dairy farming depends on investment 
in the next generation. By increasing access to credit and 
enhancing risk management programs, we can ensure that the next 
generation of farmers have the tools and resources we need to 
thrive. I urge the Committee to consider these vital programs 
and to take action to support young farmers across the country 
by passing a bipartisan farm bill this year. Young farmers like 
us cannot afford continued delays by Congress.
    Thank you for the opportunity to speak today, and I am 
happy to answer any questions you may have.

    Senator Smith. Ms. Sattazahn.

   STATEMENT OF RAECHEL SATTAZAHN, DIRECTOR OF INDUSTRY AND 
  MEMBERSHIP RELATIONS, HORIZON FARM CREDIT, MECHANICSBURG, PA

    Ms. Sattazahn. Madam Chair, Ranking Member Hyde-Smith, 
thank you for calling this hearing today. My name is Raechel 
Sattazahn and I am Director of Industry and Membership 
Relations at Horizon Farm Credit, headquartered in 
Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. At Horizon I lead strategic 
industry relationships, member education, and young and 
beginning farmer efforts. I have a passion for and lifelong 
experience in agriculture, and am proud to be the next 
generation on my husband's dairy farm in Berks County, 
Pennsylvania.
    Horizon Farm Credit provides financing, crop insurance, and 
related services to more than 20,000 farmers, ranchers, 
agribusinesses, and rural homeowners in Pennsylvania, Delaware, 
and parts of Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. We are a 
member-owned, locally governed cooperative and a member of the 
Farm Credit system. Along with 59 other Farm Credit 
institutions, Horizon Farm Credit shares a critical mission to 
support rural communities and agriculture with reliable, 
consistent credit and financial services today and tomorrow.
    Congress specifically directs Farm Credit to serve the 
needs of creditworthy young, beginning, and small farmers and 
ranchers, and we take that responsibility seriously. On a 
national level, in 2023, Farm Credit made over 50,000 loans to 
young farmers for $12.1 billion, nearly 70,000 loans to 
beginning farmers for $18.9 billion, and over 108,000 loans to 
small farmers for $14.9 billion. We work with each of our 
customers to put together the best financing packages to meet 
their needs. Often this means collaborating closely with the 
FSA through their Guaranteed Loan program to support young and 
beginning farmers who often have limited capital or assets as 
they start farming.
    Each Farm Credit Association implements a tailored program 
for young, beginning, and small farmers in their geographic 
territory. Just last year, Horizon Farm Credit launched a new 
Grow Ahead program targeted at beginning farmers. Loans through 
Grow Ahead feature discounted pricing, reduced fees, customized 
loan terms, and relaxed underwriting requirements. In addition 
to these financing options, Grow Ahead offers educational 
offerings, mentoring opportunities, and grant programs to help 
beginning farmers establish and grow successful operations.
    Our JumpStart grant programs help grow a new generation of 
farmers by offering $10,000 grants to startup farmers, like one 
of our 2021 JumpStart winners, Joel Kuhns, and his wife Emily. 
After serving in the Marine Corps for 10 years, Joel moved into 
a career in the corporate sector but desired to move back to 
his roots in central Pennsylvania and start a business. The 
Kuhns bought 47 acres in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania, where 
they founded Odyssey Orchard, a specialty apple orchard 
producing high-quality sharp and bitter sharp apples for fine 
and craft cider markets. The JumpStart grant supported growth 
of their new orchard.
    Our Farmers on the Rise award competition honors 
outstanding beginning farmers, offering $10,000 awards to 
invest in their farming operations, like one of our 2022 
winners, Nia Nyamweya. Nia owns and operates Beauty Blooms 
Farms in Montgomery County, Maryland, where she grows certified 
and naturally grown African heritage produce and flowers with 
low-till and organic practices. Inspired by her Kenyan-born 
father, Nia is developing a thriving ecosystem that celebrates 
the diversity of agriculture and community. Nia used her 
$10,000 award to purchase a walk-behind tractor and flail 
mower, allowing her to mechanize her small-scale farm. This 
award propelled the growth of Nia's farm and allowed her to 
provide more food to her Washington, DC, community.
    Additionally, our Grow Ahead program includes educational 
courses such as Ag Biz Masters, which provides virtual learning 
opportunities for participants to learn farm management skills 
and develop a business plan. Ryan Brown and his wife Andrea are 
examples of Ag Bis Masters graduates. While working as a 
railroad diesel mechanic, Ryan had the opportunity to purchase 
his grandfather's 100-acre dairy farm in Cumberland County, 
Pennsylvania. Ryan formed a partnership with a high school 
classmate who was also enrolled in Ag Biz Masters, and together 
they now farm 4,000 acres in a three-county area.
    Horizon Farm Credit's Grow Ahead program is designed to 
meet the needs of these farmers, ensuring they have the tools 
to start and grow their operations while realizing long-term 
financial success.
    We have also founded and funded the Farm Credit Foundation 
for Agriculture Advancement in 2015. This nonprofit has awarded 
more than $1.6 million through scholarships and community 
education programs, recently awarding $315,000 in scholarships 
to 39 students pursuing careers in agriculture in our 
territory.
    Thank you for the work this Subcommittee has put into 
writing a new farm bill, and we urge the Senate and House to 
come together in a bipartisan way to get the farm bill across 
the finish line.
    In my written testimony I included ideas we believe would 
benefit the next generation of agriculture. Thank you very 
much, Madam Chair and Ranking Member Hyde-Smith, for your 
passion for the next generation of agriculture and for allowing 
me to testify today. I would be happy to answer any questions.

    [The prepared statement of Ms. Sattazahn can be found on 
page 53 in the appendix.]

    Senator Hyde-Smith. [Presiding.] Thank you all for those 
opening statements. We have a vote going on now, so you will 
see members leave and come back, and Senator Smith will come 
back.
    I will go ahead and start with my first question, and it is 
going to be to Mr. Good. One farm bill proposal I have seen 
floating around recently would lower adjusted gross income, 
AGI, limits from $900,000 to $700,000, and impose them on land 
owned by an individual or legal entity for which the adjusted 
gross income exceeds $700,000. The stated objective here is, 
quote, ``to restrict wealthy investors and absentee landlords 
from benefiting from farm safety net programs intended to 
support the active farmers who are taking the risk and 
producing the crops.''
    Please tell me how such a proposal would affect farmers, 
especially young and beginning farmers.
    Mr. Good. Thank you for the question, Senator. I think 
first and foremost we have to start with the fact that farmers 
want their income to be derived from the market and not from 
the government. I think it is really important for us, when we 
look at the price coverage option, and looking at young 
farmers, to realize that young farmers especially lease a lot 
of their land rather than own their land. When we look at an 
equation where a farmer should be the means testing in that 
equation, we are the primary operator and the farms themselves 
are absorbing the risk reward from the crop.
    As somebody that leases a substantial amount of land, I do 
think that, again, it should be directed toward just the 
tenant, just because of that do means testing.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you for that honest answer. We 
have agreed to go to Senator Grassley, if that is okay, at this 
time, for a question.
    Senator Grassley. Whoever is accommodating me on this 
Committee, I thank you for doing that. I know it is rude to 
come here and not hear your testimony and ask you a lot of 
questions, but that is just the way the Senate operates, when 
you have two votes going on at the same time.
    Some of the testimony spoke to the importance of passing a 
new five-year farm bill. I agree that the farm bill needs to be 
updated to reflect the realities of farming today, not six 
years ago when the 2018 Farm Bill was passed. Farmers today 
face increase in inputs of cost on diesel, fertilizer, 
chemicals, seed, interest rates.
    Mr. Good, you will probably get a lot of these questions 
because you have got dirt under your fingernails. You spoke 
about these rising costs and the need for meaningful farm 
safety net that reflects those increases. Please speak to how 
an increase in reference prices for corn and soybeans would 
impact your farm.
    Mr. Good. Absolutely. You exactly hit it right on the head, 
Senator. When we look at our crop budgets we have seen 
increases in nitrogen fertilizer by three times. We have seen 
seed and herbicide increase upwards of 25 percent or greater, 
along with equipment. We are very much in this inflationary 
environment. The reference prices, as I mentioned in my written 
testimony and spoken testimony, at those price levels would not 
sustain our farmer operation or our family farm's operation.
    Base acres is a discussion, but I think when we look at the 
importance of reference prices, with base, without the 
reference price to support it, there is not much price support 
that is actually happening.
    Senator Grassley. Ms. Parks, going to you. You spoke about 
how farm safety net can be improved to help maximize the 
benefit for young and beginning farmers. I have been a strong 
advocate for higher reference prices. I believe that those 
higher reference prices share, there should be commonsense 
payment limitations on those programs. I have been an advocate 
for that for a long time. I have not been as successful as I 
would like to be. As I pointed out early and often, just 10 
percent of the farmer operations receive 70 percent of all 
yearly farm payment subsidies.
    Do you think that closing loopholes so that only actively 
engaged--and that is a legal term that we use in the law--or as 
I like to say, farmers with dirt under their fingernails, 
receive Title I payments can help beginning farmers compete 
with larger operations?
    Ms. Parks. Excuse me. What was your question?
    Senator Grassley. You want me to repeat it?
    Ms. Parks. Please.
    Senator Grassley. Okay. We have loopholes in the laws that 
allow several people to get in under the payment limitations we 
have. My question is, I have been for closing those loopholes, 
so I would like to have your opinion. In a technical sense we 
are really talking about making tighter the words ``actively 
engaged.'' My question to you, do you think that would help 
beginning farmers compete with larger operations if we targeted 
the farm program toward medium and small farmers?
    Ms. Parks. Thank you, Senator, for repeating your question. 
I think it is a step in the right direction. Being a beginning 
farmer comes with so many complex challenges that creating 
spaces that are more equitable and accessible for beginning 
farmers like myself that are on 100 percent rented ground, so 
government programs and opportunities are not readily available 
or accessible for us versus larger, more established 
operations. By tightening up those loopholes so that we may 
have a fighting chance I believe is really important.
    Senator Grassley. Mr. Good, my last question will have to 
go to you. I might submit a question to others in writing. I 
travel my State quite regularly, getting to each of the 99 
counties every year for a Q&A with constituents. What I hear is 
just support Federal crop insurance. It is very vital to ensure 
that farmers get through the next year despite weathering 
difficult times. It is everything that is out of their control, 
and I am not talking just about the weather. There are 
political decisions. There are embargos. There are a lot of 
things that farmers do not control.
    We have a bill that goes by the acronym FARMERS Act that 
would improve crop insurance. Could you speak to how increasing 
the affordability of crop insurance would benefit young 
farmers?
    Mr. Good. Absolutely. I am supportive of FARMERS Act, the 
FARMER Act. The premium support on the higher levels of 
coverage is very important. I was just at a young farmer and 
rancher conference meeting last weekend, and I was talking to 
an individual that had a third of their soybean crop was wiped 
out. Because they could not afford higher levels of coverage, 
they did not receive a claim. They had to get to a situation 
where they are looking to possibly self-insure with their own 
cash, moving forward.
    When we look at the cost of crop insurance we really need 
to make it affordable for young farmers, to be able to allow 
them to reach higher coverage levels so that they do not have 
to dig so deep into the deductible. That is absolutely 
important.
    Senator Grassley. Once again, thanks to my colleagues for 
helping me out.
    Senator Smith. [Presiding.] Thank you so much. I am glad to 
have you with us, Senator Grassley.
    I will defer to Senator Stabenow, Chair Stabenow, to ask 
her questions. We are in the midst of voting, for our 
witnesses, so that is why we are kind of running around a bit. 
Thank you for your understanding.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Well, thank you. Before Senator 
Grassley leaves I want to thank you, Senator Grassley, for all 
these years focusing on reforms. As you know, the bill we 
passed in the Senate in 2018 included your reforms, and I 
supported them. We did not make it all the way through the 
process, but your effort to make sure we are talking about 
active farmers in focusing this certainly affects young farmers 
that we are talking about today, but it affects everybody.
    That is why in the bill that I put forward does not allow 
wealthy Wall Street investors or foreign landowners to get farm 
payments. I mean, that is part of it too. We should be aiming 
it right to the people that, as you say, have dirt under their 
fingernails. Thank you.
    I also wanted to say that I think, in listening today, that 
there is so much common ground here. In so many ways I know 
some of you have talked about the House bill, or the Senate 
bill that we have put forward. There is a lot of common 
approaches in understanding the challenges that we need to 
have, and I think we need to start with that, where we agree. 
That is how you get a farm bill. That is how you get a 
bipartisan farm bill.
    I did want to say on several good news fronts. I am writing 
down things. Like Mr. Good, you talked about we should focus on 
the PACE bill, Klobuchar/Hoeven. It is in our bill. We should 
focus on the Crop Insurance for Future Farmers Act, Klobuchar/
Thun. It is in our bill. We should focus on childcare, in the 
bill that you talked about, which is Braun/Marshall/Smith. It 
is in our bill.
    There is a lot of what you are lifting up today, we have 
put forward here, which I think is very, very important.
    I think the difference is to get a farm bill we cannot 
split the farm community and the family safety net and get a 
bill. We have to be supporting both, and that is where success 
comes from. That is very, very important.
    I also heard, Mr. Good, you were talking about, and others 
have talked about, the disadvantage for beginning farmers who 
cannot access land with base acres. If you are fortunate that 
you are part of a family operation and you have base acres, 
that is one thing. If you are not, or if you are new, really 
new, it is hard because you cannot get those payments that we 
are talking about.
    The House did it one way. We got in our bill a proposal 
that would establish new base acres, or allow new farmers do to 
that. It is not a mandatory base update, but for new farmers it 
would establish new base acres, which I think is so important. 
Because we can talk about commodity payments, ARC and PLC, but 
if you do not have base acres, you do not have a chance to get 
that. It does not mean anything. Right now the vast majority of 
what the House bill does goes to that, and unfortunately not 
paid for, so we have to address that.
    Another piece you have talked about is a bipartisan 
proposal that we have, and I know there is support in our 
Committee for lowering the cost for crop insurance, 
particularly for beginning farmers, which is something we can 
do. We can absolutely do. We have support, bipartisan support, 
to do that.
    The final piece I will say before asking a question is on 
the dairy safety net. We have a lot of common ground there, 
both in what the House proposed, what we have in terms of the 
areas that you are talking about, boosting coverage levels, 
updating production histories, extending the premium discount, 
in our proposal and in the House. There is a lot of commonality 
there.
    I wanted to dig a little deeper on crop insurance, though, 
because like the larger farm bill, the big tent for farmers 
needs to be all kinds of farmers being able to get crop 
insurance. This is the ongoing challenge we have tried to move 
forward on, and we still have challenges. Small, diversified, 
specialty crop farmers need more options for them, and that 
continues to be what we need to focus on. I heard whole farm 
revenue insurance, making that work, as well.
    I am wondering--and I think I am running out of time here--
Ms. Parks and Ms. Sattazahn, could you talk about the role that 
crop insurance plays as you are securing financing, and in 
particular, the barriers that you face if you are a small or 
young or diversified farmer, in getting the credit to run your 
operation.
    Ms. Parks. Thank you, Senator. First, to even qualify for 
crop insurance programs you need three consecutive years of 
submitted Schedule F. Though we have been farming we just hit 
that finish line, so, in theory, all these doors have opened 
for us. Unfortunately, because we are first-generation and 
there is not a foundation set for us, we are trying to build 
our own kind of brick by brick, crop insurance currently does 
not make any sense for us in the greater scheme of things. We 
will be applying for a rainfall index because we primarily 
depend on pasture and hay for our farm income. The devastation 
from drought and currently flooding is the scariest part of our 
farm operation as far as risk. Many other beginning farmers 
like us who are unable to even access--how do I put this?--
access credit so that the debt load is enough where crop 
insurance is required by lenders and makes financial sense 
overall, we would need maybe to win the lottery or a couple 
more off-farm jobs.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. That is another strategy we could put 
in the bill, winning the lottery.
    [Laughter.]
    Ms. Parks. That is plan z, maybe.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. I do not know if Ms. Sattazahn wants 
to take just a second. I know I am out of time here.
    Senator Smith. Please go ahead.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you.
    Ms. Sattazahn. You talked a lot about programs for 
beginning farmers, and Ms. Parks spoke to that, as well. I will 
just add to that, that is where it is really important to work 
with, for beginning farmers, to form relationships with a 
lender that knows and understands agriculture, and certainly 
some of the programs that I pointed to there in my testimony of 
what Horizon Farm Credit is doing. Certainly other Farm Credits 
across the country offer similar types of programs, as well. It 
is a challenge, but we are hoping to really work together, 
because beginning farmers are the future of agriculture, and we 
want to make sure that we are supporting them.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Senator Smith. Thank you very much. Senator Boozman.
    Senator Boozman. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you all 
so much for being here. This is very helpful.
    We have talked a lot about how important it is to put 
meaningful investments in the farm safety net, and you all have 
different needs in that regard, regardless of if it is ARC, 
PLC, crop insurance, the milk program, disaster programs, all 
of those things, so that you have got the ability to hedge your 
risks. That is really the bottom line, it is so, so very 
difficult. We are working hard to do that, and we talk about 
putting more farm in the farm bill, and that is really what we 
are trying to do.
    I would like to talk to you about something I think is 
really important, and this is something that there should not 
be any controversy that we can do. We can do it tomorrow. Mr. 
Good, in your testimony you mentioned that FSA loan 
applications can be overly cumbersome, complicated--and I am 
referring this to Mr. Good, but any of you could speak on this, 
you are going through the same process--and require too much 
time to complete. The need for application streamlining and 
simplification is something I hear routinely. Can you speak 
more specifically to ways in which you would like to see the 
process made more accessible for producers who rely on these 
programs to begin and expand your operations?
    Mr. Good. Absolutely. Thank you for that question, Senator. 
When I went through that farmland purchase back in 2020, it was 
a situation that needed to close quickly, and basically the 
struggle for me was to be able to go through the process in a 
way that was timely for a real estate transaction in the real 
world. I found that when I met with the Farm Credit system it 
was very much more based on relationship and understanding of a 
sound balance sheet and working through your business plan. All 
that still happens at the FSA. It just is a long process and it 
takes a lot of time. Sometimes the boots-on-the-ground staff 
can shy away from getting that process done in a timely manner.
    Senator Boozman. Yes. I think it is especially hard on the 
smaller producers in the sense that the bigger producers are 
used to this. We have really been good about bringing forward 
new programs, but smaller producers just do not have the 
resources sometimes that others do.
    Ms. Parks, you look like you can relate to this.
    Ms. Parks. Yes. Unfortunately, accessing programs like 
EQIP, where you need to submit a grazing plan, which the FSA 
can work with you on, is unfortunately an arduous and time-
intensive process for beginning farmers like myself. Oftentimes 
when we need that support and that capital, we need it swiftly. 
Then with the finish line of our three Schedule F's, you know, 
FSA financing, so that we may live where our animals are rather 
than commuting 30 minutes one way, 45 from the farthest field, 
it will be probably through FSA financing. However, the 
requirement for a very patient, understanding, seller makes it 
even harder to access land, to find that right person and that 
right parcel, especially with livestock. They are needy.
    Senator Boozman. Very good. Mr. Lussier, we all know the 
importance of off-farm income to the success of farming 
operations, but many producers also rely on health care 
benefits secured by a spouse that works off the farm. It is 
really important for a lot of reasons.
    Unfortunately, childcare can be difficult to find and 
extremely costly in rural areas. I understand you have two 
children and another on the way.
    Mr. Lussier. Yes, sir.
    Senator Boozman. I would really like to hear--you are 
qualified to talk about this. Can you tell us more about the 
role childcare plays in your ability, enabling you to access 
capital and grow your business?
    Mr. Lussier. Thank you for that question, Senator, and I 
think you mentioned it, that off-the-farm income is becoming 
extremely important to our young farmers and ranchers. My wife 
Shelby, she works really hard so that I can live my dream every 
day, and I thank her for doing that.
    I represent a committee, American Farm Bureau, of 16 
appointments. There is not one full-time farmer on there, that 
is a part of that, 16 appointments that does not have at least 
one spouse working off the farm.
    When it comes to childcare, we have one option in our town. 
Pricing becomes an issue there. Cost is great. We have to drive 
at least 45 minutes for us to have any other options. It 
creates challenges for my wife being able to work. Lots of 
times I have got the kids with me at the farm, which creates 
challenges in its own, as you can imagine.
    Identifying those issues and realizing some of the 
challenges that our young farmers have raising a family on 
their farms, and raising children, is extremely important and 
something I appreciate you identifying.
    Senator Boozman. Well, thank you, guys. We appreciate you 
being here.
    Senator Smith. Thank you very much. Senator Warnock.
    Senator Warnock. Thank you, Madam Chair. I came in earlier 
and you were discussing the issue around base acres, and I want 
to talk some more about that. The average age of farmers is 
increasing. It is 58.1 nationally, and in Georgia it is older 
than that. About 59 is the average age. I am glad that we are 
having this hearing to talk about all the challenges around 
that.
    Mr. Good, we all know that farming is a tough job, with 
very slim margins. I spend a lot of time with farmers down in 
Georgia, and there are many reasons for this. What role does 
access to farm safety net programs play in this?
    Mr. Good. Absolutely. Thank you for that question, Senator. 
When we look at farming, it is inherently risky, and we really 
need to look at having an array of risk management tools. When 
you look at Title I and Title XI, I think they work in tandem, 
not against each other. I think crop insurance is vitally 
important, and then I think a base acre, having a strong base 
acre, and reference prices to make that base acre meaningful is 
really important. I think it is absolutely important, 
especially for this young generation.
    Senator Warnock. I agree, and as you point out, it is 
especially difficult for farmers who are starting out, young 
generations. That is what we want to see. We want to see 
farmers who are able to pass this from one generation to the 
next. We want to see folks who, maybe it is not a part of their 
family history, but are drawn to the dream of hands in the 
soil, answering the prayer that many of us pray, give us this 
day our daily bread. I have to say farmers are an answer to a 
prayer.
    How important are base acres to commodity farmers, and why 
are they more difficult to obtain?
    Mr. Good. Base acres are really the foundational piece to 
that Title I, whether it be PLC or ARC. The importance to have 
a base acre means that you have that price support and you have 
that protection or that floor beneath you that you can grow off 
of. Base acres are vitally important for me and my community, 
absolutely.
    Senator Warnock. They are expensive and hard to come by, 
and this is what I had in mind when we put together my 
legislation to provide underserved commodity farmers, including 
new and beginning farmers, the opportunity to establish or to 
increase their base acres through my Southern Crops Act. This 
bill would lower the barriers to entry for the next generation 
of farmers, and I was glad to see Chairwoman Stabenow, who 
played a disappearing act on me--I thought she was sitting in 
the chair--included my Southern Crops Act in her farm bill 
reauthorization framework. We will continue to work to see that 
it is included in the final farm bill. I think when we center 
people we have a chance to get the public policy right. It is 
folks like you that I think we have to center as we try to 
figure out a way forward, not only for your benefit but for the 
benefit of the American economy, for families.
    Another barrier new farmers face is access to credit. 
According to a 2022 study, young and beginning farmers are more 
like to be credit constrained when compared to their more 
established peers.
    Ms. Sattazahn--is that all right? Close enough?--what 
service does Farm Credit provide to producers who are just 
starting out, and why are they critical to their success?
    Ms. Sattazahn. Thank you for that question, Senator. Young 
and beginning farmers are just that. They are young and 
beginning. Oftentimes they have not had their chance to buildup 
capital reserves, they may have limited credit, their risk 
profile tends to be a little bit riskier compared to other 
farmers. That is where the importance of working with an 
organization like Farm Credit, who understands farmers, is so 
critical, and really the challenges that beginning farmers 
face.
    Again, at Horizon Farm Credit we are extremely pleased to 
be able to have launched our Grow Ahead program, where we have 
a series of different loan products available that offer 
discounted pricing, reduced fees, relaxed underwriting 
requirements, and customized terms. We also have introduced 
what we call our Farm Starter loan product. It is another 
specialized product for young and beginning farmers with 
limited credit and limited collateral, as well. We also look at 
some qualitative attributes that sometimes these young and 
beginning farmers might bring to the table, even though they 
might not have some of that credit and some of that background. 
We look at their experience, their attitude, their management 
abilities, sometimes their education that they bring to the 
table, which is extraordinarily important.
    I think a lot of beginning farmers do not start farming 
because they like the business aspect of it. They like to grow 
the crops and raise the animals. The business side of it is 
critically important, and certainly we at Farm Credit are 
trying to do our best, from an educational standpoint 
sometimes, in helping to build them up and then certainly 
offering, from the credit side, how we are able to support 
these young and beginning farmers, as well.
    Senator Warnock. Thank you so much. When we consider how 
the farm bill can best support the next generation of farmers 
we need to ensure that we are including all farmers. We know 
that as we think about young farmers, farmers of color, and 
women are disproportionately represented among the share of our 
Nation's agricultural producers. I am grateful for the work 
that you do. Thank you.
    Ms. Sattazahn. Thank you.
    Senator Smith. Senator Ernst.
    Senator Ernst. Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair and Ranking 
Member, for this Subcommittee hearing, and I want to thank our 
witnesses for being here today. I am really excited. Any time I 
get to see truly young farmers I think about when and where I 
grew up in southwest Iowa. I grew up on a farm, and I think 
about all the farmers on the surrounding farms now back home. I 
think of them as young farmers. Then I am like, oh my gosh, 
they are 50. They are like my age. Because it is all the kids. 
We all grew up together.
    Senator Smith. Maybe they are 40 and they look 50 or 60.
    Senator Ernst. It is really, really nice to have you here, 
and again, I am so excited about it.
    Many examples that you have given today. Thank you so much 
for sharing your own personal testimony. It really demonstrates 
why we need a modernized farm bill and one that focuses on 
those programs that are actually going to the farm. I hope that 
we do continue to make progress here in the Senate.
    Ms. Sattazahn, we will start with you. In my home State of 
Iowa our turkey and our egg producers have been hit very hard 
by a highly pathogenic avian influenza. It hit us the first 
time when I came into the Senate in 2015, and that was a 
traumatic time for our producers. While we have been free of 
the virus since December of last year, just in this last week 
now we have identified bird flu in an egg-laying facility with 
4.2 million chickens in the northwest corner of the State. Then 
we have got another farm with over 100,000 turkeys in a nearby 
county.
    Now we do have the USDA Indemnification Program, and that 
does help, but the farmer is at a loss of any income that might 
have come, or would have been expected from the flock.
    Ms. Sattazahn, those poultry and livestock producers are 
really focused on foreign animal disease preparedness and 
biosecurity. Can you walk us through what you can do for your 
customers when avian influenza or another foreign animal 
disease strikes?
    Ms. Sattazahn. Thank you, Senator, so much for that 
question, and I certainly agree. Disease outbreaks are a 
significant concern in the agriculture industry, and I hate to 
see it when they do happen. Unfortunately we have seen a number 
of them happen here in recent years, and we certainly take that 
very seriously.
    I would say, first and foremost, we work very closely with 
a lot of State organizations and others in the industry. We are 
not in this alone. Agriculture, we are supported by a number of 
different agricultural organizations that are supporting our 
producers out there, as well. Staying up to date on what is 
going on there with the outbreaks, the impacts that they may 
have, as well, is critically important.
    I will also speak to the side of, if there is an outbreak, 
on a farm, a farm in our territory, certainly farmers being 
open and contacting their lender as soon as they are aware of 
the situation, sooner is better than later, and we can work 
through a number of different options with them. Again, a lot 
of times working with other agricultural organizations within 
the State and across the country in those matters, as well.
    Internally, within Farm Credit, we take biosecurity very 
seriously. Even our staff limiting farm visits, providing them 
with necessary PPE, just very critical. I think, again, that is 
something that all of us in agriculture can come together for, 
in support of. Certainly they are terrible when they happen, 
but I think you see the agriculture industry really rally 
around trying to do our part to keep our farms and the animals 
safe.
    Senator Ernst. Right. No, and that is great. Collaboration, 
I think, is key, any time we see those types of issues sweeping 
through our farms or for our producers.
    Mr. Good, just very briefly, in your testimony you 
mentioned that markets are critical for the commodities you 
produce, particularly corn and soybeans. In my home State of 
Iowa our farmers are really frustrated to watch trade kind of 
go by the wayside under the Administration. In the past 3 1/2 
years we really have not seen any new trade agreements, and 
that is discouraging for us.
    As a result, the Department of Agriculture projected 
earlier on this year that the U.S. would see a record 
agricultural trade deficit of $3.5 billion in 2024. That has 
recently been updated to $32 billion trade deficit. Do you 
agree this only hurts farmers, especially those that are just 
starting out, if we are not engaging in trade agreements?
    Mr. Good. Thank you, Senator, for bringing that point. 
Currently, as you stated, we are in a trade deficit, and 
farmers rely on foreign markets to grow demand. That is 
absolutely needed. The House highlighted this need with their 
bill, with MAP and FMD funding increases. To get better market 
access and develop foreign markets is vitally important.
    I actually just went--and I will speak this briefly--but I 
went to Panama and Colombia on a trade mission alongside the 
USDA just recently, back in the spring, and got to meet with 
some of the end consumers in Colombia, and how the U.S. soybean 
is one of the most reliable quality products available. Our 
logistics are very timely. They spoke to the importance of 
using U.S. soybeans over some of our greatest competitors, and 
I think that is important as we find those markets, access new 
markets, not the ones that we have relied on for years, but 
find those new markets and do business with them.
    Senator Ernst. Yes, thank you, and I appreciate all of you 
again for being engaged in agriculture. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Senator Smith. Thank you so much, Senator Ernst. I will 
just mention--I am going to ask my questions next--I will just 
mention there was some good conversation about the importance 
of having good childcare in rural communities. I know that this 
is something that you and I have worked on a lot, and there are 
good provisions in the framework that Senator Stabenow has 
offered to forward that. That is a good bipartisan effort that 
I hope we can keep going as these young farmers are trying to 
figure out how to drive 45 minutes to find good childcare at 
the same time that you are trying to run an operation.
    I want to just quickly, if I could, ask consent from my 
colleagues to submit the following items into the record. The 
first is the National Young Farmers Coalition farmer survey. 
The next is the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition 
report titled, ``Unsustainable: State of the Farm Safety Net.'' 
The third is the Independent Community Bankers of America 
testimony.
    Is there any objection?
    [No response.]
    Senator Smith. Thank you very much.

    [The documents can be found on page 64-162 in the 
appendix.]

    Senator Smith. I am really struck by this conversation. It 
is so interesting and so useful. I am struck by a couple of 
things, but maybe the biggest of them is that if you are truly 
starting out, just getting going, and you are not coming from 
an operation where you are maybe transitioning ownership from 
one generation to the next, it is like you have to kind of have 
it together to get it together, you know what I mean, 
financially. Like there is a first step that you have to take, 
and how do you take that first step? Ms. Parks, you are 
describing that so clearly when you are hoping to be able to 
get to the place where you could take advantage of crop 
insurance, but just getting there is a challenge.
    I want to ask, start with Ms. Sattazahn, from your 
perspective I am sure you just see hundreds and hundreds of 
young farmers. What could we do to kind of help create that 
first step so that you are able to actually participate in some 
of these, crop insurance, for example?
    Ms. Sattazahn. Sure. Thank you, Senator, for the question. 
Yes, you describe it exactly right. There are a number of 
hurdles that beginning farmers face as they get started, and I 
think really we can all rally around a few different areas.
    No. 1, I think the more that we can educate our young and 
beginning farmers on how they can overcome these challenges, 
but also providing them with the tools they need, so the 
education, the business, the financial management education, 
and the networking. No. 2, connecting them with other young and 
beginning farmers I think is also critically important, and I 
am sure a lot of these other individuals would speak to that, 
as well.
    I think understanding the tools that are available is 
another huge hurdle. I spoke in my testimony about Joel Kuhns, 
right, a veteran, sort of a second career as a farmer. Where 
does he even go to get support through the Extension Service 
and the Small Business Development Centers and the Farm 
Credits, and all of the other organizations out there?
    I think being able to showcase our resources and make sure 
they are getting into the hands of folks that, again, if they 
do not come from that background, they might not even be aware 
that those resources exist. Being very open about sharing those 
resources and leveraging one another within this community. 
Again, no two beginning farmers are the same. They come to us 
in a lot of different ways and capacities. To me that is the 
initial first start is education and resources.
    Then really taking it from there. I spoke about our 
JumpStart grant program. That is an example of----
    Senator Smith. That is a grant program.
    Ms. Sattazahn [continuing]. a grant program, precisely.
    Senator Smith. You need capital to build capital.
    Ms. Sattazahn. Exactly. They might not even be ready for a 
loan yet, but that grant could help them in a lot of ways, 
maybe some initial equipment, business formation, those types 
of things. That is why we created that program.
    Senator Smith. Thank you. Ms. Parks, could you just talk a 
little bit about kind of what you and your husband have found 
in terms of getting access to those sorts of networks and kind 
of support systems that I know is a part of the place where you 
are farming and some of the good community groups we have in 
Minnesota.
    Ms. Parks. One of the many reasons why we decided to settle 
in Minnesota was that community. However, if you do not know 
how to get that introduction and get into that room, you find 
yourself feeling a listless. It is a lot of time and emotional 
labor to try and seek out those resources yourself, time that 
we also spend dedicated toward raising calves and building our 
farm business. You just cut out sleep.
    Helping other beginning farmers know where those resources 
are, kind of what questions to even ask. Like we have been very 
fortunate with Farmers Union Insurance, that we are trying to 
figure out what insurance is, in our late 20's, you know, that 
kind of last push out of the nest for health insurance by my 
parents was a number of years ago, but it was still a learning 
process on how to advocate for yourself, how to take care of 
yourself as an adult, let alone a farm. Helping beginning 
farmers to kind of lead them to the water trough, so to speak, 
is something that this next generation really does need.
    Senator Smith. Thank you so much. I believe Senator 
Tuberville is next.
    Senator Tuberville. Thank you very much. Thanks for being 
here today. Great topics, farm bill and the future of our 
Nation's agriculture industry. I get very depressed when I go 
home to Alabama. Obviously farmers put food on our tables, but 
unfortunately a lot of people across this country think that 
all the crops and the meat come from out back of Walmart and 
Publix and Piggly Wiggly's. They need to wake up and smell the 
roses before it is too late.
    We have hardworking people that believe in conservation. 
The EPA is unbelievably hard on our farmers, unfortunately. 
They need help. Everywhere I go they need help with the rising 
input costs, fluctuating prices. They cannot control the 
weather, obviously. Costs are up. Income is coming down. Just 
the last few years we have lost 25,000 farmers that have left 
the industry, and over 150,000 farms have closed. I talked to 
two farmers last week in Alabama who said, ``Game, set, match 
this year if I can't make a little money.'' Can't afford to pay 
back the bank.
    We have got to open our eyes to this because we have to 
eat. We cannot depend on people from other countries to supply 
what we need. Plus we need to make sure that our farmers are 
held to a standard where they can compete with people that we 
import from.
    Mr. Good, the farm bill that passed out of the House Ag 
Committee allows for a one-time allocation of base acres to 
growers using a planting history from 2019 to 2023. Do you see 
this opportunity to access base as encouraging to beginning 
producers, and what impact will this have from an economic 
perspective?
    Mr. Good. Absolutely. Great question, Senator. I see the 
opportunity, especially in the House provision, where they have 
an update of base for everybody. Because I think, as you 
stated, inflation is not choosing sides. Inflation is hitting 
all of us. Like I addressed earlier, we are seeing it in seed, 
fertilizer, equipment, in every area. To have the safety net, 
we see the market fluctuations of just address the need for 
more markets.
    I think the base is an opportunity. It is a foundational 
piece to be able to build that risk management portfolio, and 
for young farmers, especially, that, as we stated, their 
balance sheets are not as strong.
    Senator Tuberville. It is hard to understand how just in 
the last two or three years the prices of this equipment has 
doubled and tripled and quadrupled in amount of money. I know 
we do not make a lot in this country anymore. We need to get 
back to that. The manufacturing and a lot of it, it says it is 
made in America but it goes by way of other countries before it 
actually has the USA imprint put on it.
    Do you see that? Are you hearing that from people that you 
work around?
    Mr. Good. Absolutely. I think as we look at precision 
agriculture, I think that is a very vital piece. Just on my 
farm operation we are able to demo the John Deere See & Spray 
sprayer to be able to reduce inputs. With this technology there 
are additional costs. When we look at equipment, it seems to 
follow the way that the commodity markets do. As farmers we are 
putting an increasing amount of our budget into equipment, 
which is a very big issue for us young farmers, as well.
    Senator Tuberville. Yes. At Auburn, where I live, a land-
grant university, they have a great ag school, vet school. We 
see it growing to a certain point, but I do not understand, you 
know, what a lot of these young people are looking at, to be 
honest with you. I know they talk to their parents about the 
future of farming and possibly going back and taking over their 
farms.
    There are over 20,000 young and beginning producers in 
Alabama, 20,000, many of whom will want to pass their farms on 
to the next generation. Any of you can answer this. Mr. Good, 
you can start with this. Can you speak to the importance of 
extending President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
provisions such as the increased estate tax exemption, step-up 
in basis, and bonus depreciation to support farm families?
    Mr. Good. Absolutely. I think at the core of what we need 
is a sound tax policy. When I think about my wife, Laura, and 
my two boys, Caleb and Peter, I am looking to build something. 
I am looking to build something that is meaningful in a way 
that we are feeding the world. For me to not be able to pass it 
on to my children in a meaningful way, or to give them more of 
a liability as a gift, I think that is against what we are 
looking to do here. My family is in full support of the step-up 
basis and extending that estate tax limit.
    Senator Tuberville. Well, God bless all farmers, because 
you do not get a lot of help. You get a lot of ridicule. You 
get the climate people looking at you, wanting to change all 
the rules in midstream. That is unfortunate because farmers 
care more about conservation than anybody could ever imagine.
    Thanks for what you all do, and thanks for being here 
today. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Senator Smith. Thank you, Senator Tuberville. Senator 
Hoeven.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you, Chairman and Ranking Member, for 
letting me join you on your very important hearing today on 
young people in agriculture. I think the average age of our 
farmers and ranchers now is about 60 years old, which does not 
seem that old to me, but it probably seems pretty darn old to 
all of you. The reality is we have got to find ways to get more 
young people into farming and ranching, and then make sure they 
are successful, right.
    The capital requirements are tough. The markets are tough. 
I mean, it is a tough business. It is a high-tech business now. 
These beginning farmer programs are really important.
    I want to start with crop insurance, because one of the 
things that I want to make sure we do in this farm bill is that 
we make it more affordable to buy crop insurance at a level 
that is effective for you, whether it is at the enterprise 
level, so at your farm level, or the supplemental coverage 
option (SCO), to give you that added lift, you know, when you 
have tough weather and you get kind of a marginal crop.
    First I would ask for all of you, do you agree that crop 
insurance is a really, really vital risk management tool for 
our farmers and ranchers, and it has got to be in the farm 
bill, and it has got to be in the farm bill in a way that is 
affordable. Would you all agree with that?
    [Witnesses agree.]
    Senator Hoeven. Okay. Then let's take it to the next level. 
Now let's talk about beginning farmers. Senator Tester and I 
are working on some of the programs on the rancher side, 
whether it is LFP or LIP or ELAP and all those, to make them 
more dependable and consistent for cattle producers.
    Talk to me. What can we do for beginning farmers on the 
crop insurance piece that, in your opinion, would strengthen it 
and help those beginning farmers? If you just run through the 
line and give me four great ideas, that would be good enough 
for today.
    Mr. Good. Well, I think there has already been a lot of 
good progress spoken. We look at the FARMER Act. We look at the 
Crop Insurance for Future Farmers Act of 2023. Both of those, I 
think, create sound policy, moving forward.
    Senator Hoeven. Say that once more about the FARMER Act? 
Could you repeat that? I didn't quite hear it.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Hoeven. You said it would be really good policy?
    Mr. Good. I think so, when we can bring premium support.
    Senator Hoeven. By the way, Cindy Hyde-Smith is on that 
bill. Go ahead. I am sorry.
    Mr. Good. I think that the premium supports is the 
returning issue. I think for young farmers and ranchers they 
are putting out a lot of their costs on the upfront. We see 
these costs are inflated, as well. Deductibles may be the 
profit margin. Deductibles may be the profit margin. I think at 
the end of the day if we can reduce that deducible, we can make 
crop insurance affordable, then I think that we will have a 
much more solid base.
    Senator Hoeven. Less need for ad hoc disaster packages too, 
right?
    Mr. Good. I think in tandem.
    Senator Hoeven. More certainty to get your operation 
financed every year, which hopefully brings down your cost of 
credit.
    Okay.
    Ms. Parks.
    Ms. Parks. Because our farm is beginning we have not yet 
been able to access crop insurance that makes sense for us, so 
having flexibility for the diverse number and types of farms is 
vitally important. Because those of us who find themselves not 
owning land and do not have that security of knowing where you 
are going to farm after your leases run out, potentially, 
having a safety net for what you do produce when you do produce 
it is vital.
    Senator Hoeven. Okay.
    Mr. Lussier. Risk mitigation is the biggest part for me, 
for young farmers. I had a farmer tell me one time that they 
take a million dollars and they plant it this far underground 
every year, and they hope that it comes up. As you look at 
that--and that really struck me as we do not control the 
weather. There are a lot of challenges as farmers.
    I do not have any crop insurance myself, as a dairy farmer 
that does not do any row crops. I take advantage of the DMC 
program. I know that when I go to lenders and when I talk about 
gaining access to capital, they ask me, ``Are you involved in 
these programs that can mitigate the risks and give you the 
opportunity to ensure that you are going to be able to make 
these payments?''
    Senator Hoeven. Okay.
    Ms. Sattazahn. Yes, and I will just put an exclamation 
point on it all that risk management is critically important to 
all farmers, certainly beginning farmers, as well, and add to 
that, I mean, I certainly support all the different crop 
insurance programs out there. In Pennsylvania we have a lot of 
dairy producers, so dairy margin coverage particularly of 
interest, as well. Certainly we encourage Farm Credit 
borrowers, other producers out there, that is a way to help 
against all the different risks of farming, and certainly 
support that.
    Senator Hoeven. Affordability and then making sure that 
those deductibles do not eat up any margin. Then, Mr. Lussier, 
you brought up the access to credit. Senator Klobuchar and I 
have a bill that would increase the credit limits for FSA and 
some of the other programs. Then we need enhancements under 
beginning farmer and rancher, where you can borrow at a lesser 
cost.
    Any ideas that you all would have that you would want to 
throw it on the FSA, the financing, the funding piece for 
beginning farmers?
    Mr. Lussier. I think you hit the nail on the head when 
talking about raising those limits. I have been able to take 
advantage of three FSA loans, and just the cost of land has 
skyrocketed. The cost of inputs. To buy a facility and then put 
cattle on it, and buy the equipment to be able to farm it, 
those numbers have increased so much. Those limits need to 
follow suit.
    Senator Smith. Thank you so much. I think that Senator 
Hyde-Smith has a question before we wrap up. Thank you.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Yes. Just one more. I think this is 
lingering on and I can submit the rest. Mr. Good, you had 
mentioned catfish production. You and I are from a State that 
produces more catfish than any State in the entire country. 
Arkansas and Alabama come in behind us. A lot of folks just 
simply do not understand or know how to manage or how 
challenging that is.
    Please share more with the Subcommittee about how farm-
raised catfish production works and how some of the challenges 
faced by those catfish producers might prohibit beginning 
farmers from getting involved in agriculture in that way. 
Because aquaculture is very important in Mississippi, and we 
still have a market. Could you kind of put some highlights on 
that, of how the challenges are?
    Mr. Good. Absolutely. Thank you, Senator. In the catfish 
business it is very capital intensive in the beginning. We have 
to put up levees. That means moving dirt to make it happen. 
Then we stock our ponds with the fish, and then we harvest them 
at the end. It is not smooth as it sounds. In the middle of 
that process, and even from the beginning, we experience a 
nearly constant disaster due to federally protected migratory 
birds eating our fish, and this sum totals up to approximately 
$65 million a year. That cost goes from trying to scare off the 
birds to the birds eating the fish, which is our final product, 
and then also the diseases that can infiltrate a pond from 
those migratory birds.
    Adding bird depredation as an eligible loss to ELAP would 
provide a desperate safety net for these catfish farmers. If 
you are a catfish farmer coming in, and you are laying out all 
that upfront cost for the infrastructure, and then at the end 
of the day your profit is literally consumed, we do need a 
safety net desperately. It has been one that is long overdue.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you for those comments. You have 
all done great.
    Senator Smith. Well, thank you so much. Thank you again to 
our witnesses for being here today and for providing testimony. 
We often mention, in the Agriculture Committee, that we are 
lucky to work in a space that is not as partisan as other 
spaces, although we certainly have our regional differences. I 
look forward to continued work that we can do to pass a 
bipartisan bill, and I am very grateful for the input and the 
insight that you all provided to us as we continue that work.
    For Senators who wish to submit questions for the record, 
those questions are due one week from today, which will be 
Tuesday, June 11th. For our witnesses, you will have two weeks 
to respond to any questions for the record.
    Thank you again, and with that this hearing is adjourned.

    [Whereupon, at 4:37 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
