                        TUESDAY, APRIL 16, 2024

                                     U.S. Senate,  
                           Committee on Homeland Security  
                                  and Governmental Affairs,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in room 
SD-342, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Gary Peters, Chair 
of the Committee, presiding.
    Present: Senators Peters [presiding], Carper, Hassan, 
Rosen, Blumenthal, Ossoff, Butler, Paul, Johnson, Lankford, 
Scott, Hawley, and Marshall.

             OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR PETERS\1\

    Chairman Peters. The Committee will come to order. Welcome 
to today's hearing on oversight of the United States Postal 
Service (USPS). I want to take a moment to thank our witnesses 
for being here today. This panel includes executives from each 
governing body that helps govern and oversee the Postal 
Service. Each of them will offer a valuable insight here today. 
The Postal Service offers a critical public service. Postal 
workers deliver every day to keep our communities connected. As 
the only carrier that reaches every address in the nation, the 
Postal Service ensures that Americans everywhere can stay in 
touch, receive goods, and more no matter where they live.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ The prepared statement of Senator Peters appears in the 
Appendix on page 47.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This Committee has jurisdiction over the Postal Service, 
and we have a responsibility to examine this agency's work to 
ensure it effectively is serving the American people. That is 
why we are here today.
    This hearing comes at a critical time for the Postal 
Service. Two years ago, I led the passage of the bipartisan 
Postal Service Reform Act (PSRA), the first major reform to the 
Postal Service in over 15 years. This legislation set the 
agency on more stable financial footing and provided critical 
transparency on local service to the public.
    This legislation has eliminated unfair financial burdens 
that have long undermined the Postal Service, and in total will 
provide $50 billion in financial relief over 10 years. The 
intent of this law was to help ensure the Postal Service can 
keep reliably serving all communities. Two years later, the 
Postal Service is implementing this legislation, including 
helping postal employees and retirees integrate their health 
care with Medicare.
    But the agency has also taken a series of changes on its 
own, reforms that it claims to help save money and to improve 
operations. These operational changes appear to be significant. 
The Postal Service plans to make changes to its processing and 
delivery network across the country. It plans to consolidate 
facilities into larger, more centralized hubs and reducing the 
number of times that mail is collected at facilities each day.
    In some communities these changes have unfortunately 
disrupted or caused declines in services. I remain concerned 
about these changes. There's no clear evidence that shows the 
changes will improve service in the long run. When I have asked 
the Postal Service for detailed studies it has not been 
provided to me.
    The Postal Service has even said it must execute more 
changes before studying their impacts, essentially plowing 
ahead without knowing whether service will be harmed. It is 
also not clear these changes will actually save money. We know 
these changes led to increased cost at one facility, and the 
Postal Service has not been transparent about their overall 
cost projections.
    So far, these changes appear to be moving in the wrong 
direction. Service is down, cost is up, and customers are being 
let down. I have called on the Postal Service to pause these 
changes until it can show they won't undermine the agency's 
primary responsibility to provide timely and reliable service 
to the community.
    Before moving further, the Postal Service must study the 
locations that have been altered so far, investigate the root 
causes of disruptions, restore normal service, and understand 
the long-term implications of this plan. If the Postal Service 
continues moving forward at this drastic pace without studying 
the impacts, they will harm service and drive customers 
nationwide.
    The Postal Service must continue adapting to ensure it's 
consistently improving service, but it needs to proceed with 
caution to ensure it protects on-time delivery for the 
communities who rely on the Postal Service each and every day.
    This Committee is committed to conducting oversight to hold 
the Postal Service to this mission, and I look forward to the 
witnesses addressing the concerns that I have raised here 
today. I look forward to working to improve the health of the 
Postal Service and to make sure that we protect this vital and 
critical institution.
    With that, I would like to turn over this to Ranking Member 
Paul for his opening remarks.

               OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR PAUL

    Senator Paul. Thank you, Mr. Chair. In an 1808 letter, 
Thomas Jefferson shared simple wisdom that seems to have evaded 
the Federal Government. Jefferson wrote, ``I do not know on 
what principles of reasoning it is that good men think that the 
public ought to pay more for a thing that they would themselves 
if they were buying it themselves.''
    It's those principles or reasoning, or rather the lack 
thereof that bring us here today. In 2020, Congress was led to 
believe that the $107 billion bailout of the Postal Service 
would pull the Postal service out of the hole. Instead, we were 
told they would break even. We were even told they would break 
even by 2031.
    Postmaster General (PG) DeJoy sat in front of this 
Committee in August of that year and stated, ``I am absolutely 
convinced that with some help from Congress and our regulator, 
we can do it, and that there is a bright future ahead for the 
Postal Service.''
    I argued that giving more money to the Postal Service was 
equivalent to burning money. However, that may have been a 
false equivalency because at least when we burn money, it 
provides warmth. Given the continued financial shortfalls of 
the Postal Service, it is entirely nonsensical for it to 
convert more than 125,000 service workers into career roles 
since October 2020, which effectively allows those workers to 
make 50 percent more hourly and is insourcing jobs that were 
provided at a lower cost by private partners.
    During the Postal Service Reform Act, I argued that no 
funding should be given to USPS without changing its labor 
practices. Instead, no labor changes were made, and now 
Americans are left holding the bag of an ever more bloated 
Postal Service.
    The service has tried to explain away these bad numbers due 
to costs that they cannot control. But the service is spending 
$9.6 billion in electric delivery vehicles and spending nearly 
$40 billion over 10 years to convert and build certain 
facilities into hubs that so far do not seem to work.
    This has not stopped Congress from throwing even more money 
at the Postal Service by way of $10 billion through the CARES 
Act Funds, and $3 billion more to buy electric delivery trucks. 
For those counting, that's $120 billion in funding relief in 
the past four years alone.
    While 120 billion is already an astounding number on it's 
own, when you consider this sum relative to our nation's dismal 
fiscal condition, it suddenly becomes reckless. We have nearly 
$35 trillion in debt, or 122 percent of gross domestic product 
(GDP). This is the highest level of debt this nation has ever 
had, and we show no signs of slowing, slowing down and adding 
nearly a $1 trillion to our debt every hundred days.
    This year, we have already spent more to pay the interest 
on our debt than we have on our own defense. Now, the Postal 
Service is asking Congress to provide it with an additional $14 
to a $100 billion in taxpayer dollars by transferring funds 
from the Office of Personal Management (OPM) to USPS.
    At some point, Congress needs to pull its head out of the 
sand and stop throwing money we do not have at an agency to 
maintain status quo, especially when the status quo means more 
deficits. USPS needs massive structural reform, not necessarily 
in its network, but in its workforce, hiring, and retention.
    Today's hearing will provide Americans transparency in what 
their dollars are funding and why their post office is not 
meeting their service and delivery goals. It will reveal 
Congress's lack of prudence in legislating decisionmaking.
    Chairman Peters. Thank you, Ranking Member Paul. It's the 
practice of this Committee to swear in witnesses.
    You may be seated. Thank you. Our first witness today is 
Louis DeJoy. He is the 75th Postmaster General of the United 
States and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the U.S. Postal 
Service. He was appointed by the organization's Board of 
Governors and began his tenure in June 2020.
    Mr. DeJoy previously spent over three decades in the 
private sector running a logistics business as both its 
Chairman and its CEO. Mr. DeJoy, it's good to have you here 
before us today. You may proceed with your opening comments.

   TESTIMONY OF LOUIS DEJOY,\1\ POSTMASTER GENERAL AND CHIEF 
        EXECUTIVE OFFICER, UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE

    Mr. DeJoy. Thank you. Good morning, Chair Peters, Ranking 
Member Paul, and Members of the Committee. I welcome the 
opportunity to testify today and describe and discuss the 
challenges that face the United States Postal Service and the 
opportunities for our future. I commend the Committee and Chair 
Peters for passage of the Postal Service Reform Act of 2022.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. DeJoy appears in the Appendix on 
page 49.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Thankfully, PSRA clarified long-standing questions and 
solved several legacy retirement issues, which are immensely 
helpful to our long-term prognosis. However, as important for 
our current discussion, PSRA did not legislate solutions for 
our operational problems or ensure our financial survival. 
Instead, more work needs to be done, and the PSRA confirmed 
that it's up to the Postal Service to take the appropriate and 
necessary actions to save the Postal Service fully.
    With the PSRA now law, I am not here with any specific 
legislative requests of this Committee. Instead, what we need 
now is for our stakeholders to support us in the implementation 
of key self-help initiatives outlined in the Delivering for 
America (DFA) Plan, that are critically necessary, and that 
will ultimately enable our operational and financial success.
    I remind this Committee that the DFA Plan played an 
important role in gaining support for the passage of the Postal 
Service Reform Act of 2022. In addition to the reversal of 
unfair requirements for pre-fund retiree healthcare benefits, 
certain foundational underpinnings of the DFA were in fact 
incorporated in legislation. Such as six day a week delivery 
and operating an integrated mail and package network.
    I also offered a committee that the DFA very much aligned 
with our legislative requirement to be financially self-
sustaining, a fundamental business model concept to which I am 
fully and firmly committed to, and which is at the core of 
almost every DFA initiative.
    As Senators, you understand, the Postal Service had been a 
financial and operational death spiral the 14 years prior to my 
arrival here in June 2020, and had no effective plan to improve 
operations or curtail financial losses. The Postal Service was 
destined for financial collapse.
    But for the initiatives identified in the DFA plan and the 
actions we are now taking to remedy the untenable and 
unsustainable financial, organizational and operational 
condition, I found the Postal Service in when I assumed this 
position. There are simply no alternative strategies that I 
have seen that holistically address the legacy elements with 
the constraints that exist and put us on the path to long-term 
viability.
    When I last appeared before this Committee, I was a few 
months into my tenure at the Postal Service, and the Nation and 
the Postal Service were amid a global pandemic. The pandemic 
demonstrated the Postal Service's essential and fundamental 
value to the nation's critical infrastructure and our unique 
ability to reach every American daily. I now appear before you 
with three and a half years of heightened understanding under 
my belt and with a sense of urgency regarding the need to 
ensure the Postal Service's financial and operational staying 
power.
    Today, I have a formative team alongside me, the men and 
women of the United States Postal Service, working harder and 
smarter than ever before to transform this organization so that 
it has a relevant and viable future to service the American 
people. I am proud of their efforts. This Committee should be 
proud of their efforts. The American people should be proud of 
their efforts.
    The Committee should be fully aware of our significant 
progress we have made on our 10-year strategic plan, the DFA 
plan, as well as the significant obstacles that lay ahead. We 
remain firm in our position that the status quo is not an 
option if we want a financially self-sufficient Postal Service 
that provides a high quality service expected of us far into 
the future.
    I ask that you recognize that our pursuit of long-term 
viability should have be done over a decade earlier, and that 
the damage inflicted on the organization by all stakeholders 
failing to react, evolve, or engage has produced an 
organization that was defeated and locked into strategies of 
the past that proved self-destructive in a modern American 
economy, and given the volume in mail mix changes. As a result, 
the road to success will not be a straight and easy path. 
Rather, it will be a series of accomplishments, struggles, and 
recoveries that will be uncomfortable at times.
    However, in the end, we will not only produce the operating 
and financial successes to which we aspire, but we will also 
advance the institutional culture of the organization, enabling 
us to engage in our future in a much more logical, organized, 
confident, and successful manner--starkly different from how we 
engaged our recent past.
    My hope is that all stakeholders recognize the challenges 
this management team faces in stemming its losses, 
reconstituting its infrastructure, and breaking down 
longstanding practice that have deprived the American people of 
a viable Postal Service. I hope that they join us in 
accomplishing the ongoing improvements we aspire. I look 
forward to answering any questions you may have.
    Chairman Peters. Thank you, Postmaster General DeJoy. Our 
second witness is Roman Martinez IV. He was appointed to the 
Postal Service Board of Governors and confirmed by the Senate 
in August 2019. As Chairman, he is responsible for leading the 
Board of Governors, which oversees and approves the Postal 
Service's financial, as well as operational plans to ensure 
that it's on the right track.
    Mr. Martinez' previous career experience is in investment 
banking and business, including three decades at Lehman 
Brothers. Mr. Martinez you are recognized for your opening 
comments.

TESTIMONY OF HONORABLE ROMAN MARTINEZ IV,\1\ CHAIRMAN, BOARD OF 
             GOVERNORS UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE

    Mr. Martinez. Thank you, Chair Peters, Ranking Member Paul 
and Members of the Committee. Thank you for inviting me to 
appear before you today. I am honored to serve as Chair of the 
Board of Governors. I joined the Board with almost 50 years of 
experience in business and financial markets, including almost 
30 years, serving on boards of private public and not-for-
profit organizations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Martinez appears in the Appendix 
on page 67.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    From experience, I have learned to analyze complex pieces 
and financial challenges and to appreciate best practices of 
board governance. Three years ago, postal management and our 
Board of Governors developed a 10 year Delivering for America 
plan to set the Postal Service on a path to fulfill its mission 
and to become financially self-sufficient.
    The Board of Governors continues to support the DFA plan 
and postmaster General DeJoy's efforts to implement this 
incredibly complex and critical transformation of the Postal 
Service. We fully recognize that these changes will not be 
without impacts and temporary service disruptions.
    We must learn from such impacts and recover as quickly as 
possible. Now, I would like to make some comments on our 
financial results because they are very frequently 
misunderstood. Because the Postal Service has no control over 
some key expenses. It is important to analyze its financial 
results by focusing is controllable income laws, which are the 
results that may be addressed by management. This is akin to 
the operating results of a company, not the extraordinary items 
that are sometimes needed to be recorded.
    When uncontrollable factors are added to the financial 
statements as required by Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles (GAAP), sizable losses are reported. Those losses 
are not the correct way to judge the financial results of the 
Delivering for America plan. I will explain.
    During the first quarter of fiscal year (FY) 2024, the 
Postal Service recorded approximately $500 million of 
controllable income, but yet a net loss of $2.1 billion under 
GAAP. There are three main uncontrollable factors that resulted 
in this sizable gap loss. First, in the first quarter, the 
amortization of unfunded pension liabilities amounted to 
approximately $1.4 billion.
    This is a direct consequence of the law that requires USPS 
pension contributions be invested exclusively in U.S. Treasury 
debt securities. This has resulted in an outsized mismatch of 
investment assets and liabilities, liabilities that are subject 
to inflation adjustments, particularly disastrous in periods of 
negative real rates of interest, as recently experienced.
    Other independent agencies like Amtrak and Tennessee Valley 
Authority (TVA) are not subject to these limitations. A recent 
Inspector General (IG) report found that if Postal retirement 
funds had been invested in a diversified 60/40 stock bond 
portfolio, our almost a hundred billion of retirement funds 
deficit in 2022 would have been an $800 billion surplus, let it 
sink in. Because of the law that requires to invest in U.S. 
treasury securities, which are mostly, at most medium term, we 
have had to record sizable losses that we have no control or 
management over.
    Second, the Postal Service remains saddled with paying a 
disproportionate share of civil service retirement system 
(CSRS) costs. These are for postal employees who work for a 
predecessor organization, the Post Office Department. A recent 
Office of Inspector General (OIG) report noted, that the Postal 
Service is expected to cover the full cost of CSRS benefits 
while other Federal agencies are not.
    If OPM used more modern actuarial methods, the Postal 
Service would have roughly a hundred billion more in CSRS fund. 
These are funds that we contributed. These were not given to us 
by the government. The DFA plan assumed that CSRS reform could 
be effectuated by the Executive Branch. About an hour or so 
ago, the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) issued a press release 
saying that no, if this were to be changed, they would require 
legislative action. I would submit this is an injustice. The 
way the Postal Service has been saddled. These two factors 
alone accounted for nearly 80 percent of our recorded losses 
last year.
    When you talk about six billion of losses, you got to take 
into account that 80 percent of them, were by things that we 
did not control. I urge you to read the two Office of Inspector 
General reports that I cited. One is dated April 26, 2023, and 
the other one January 8, 2024. They are extremely informative 
and lay out exactly the problem that I just described in 
detail.
    Now, third factor inflating the Postal Service's expenses 
is our workers' compensation obligations. The OIG has also 
noted on a different report that absent legislative changes, 
the organization is limited in its ability to adopt cost saving 
initiatives that are often used in private industry. These 
expenses total about $1.6 billion annually. If the Postal 
Service could adopt some of the best practices used by private 
sector, the OIG estimates that potential savings are over $300 
million annually.
    Furthermore, as if this was not enough under GAAP, the 
reported workers comp' liabilities on the books are adjusted by 
changes in interest rates. In the first quarter of 2024, it 
resulted in a non-cash expense of $1.2 billion. I urge you to 
read another report from the OIG of May 26, 2023, that goes 
into great detail as to this frankly, travesty.
    Now, these are complex issues, but they are critical to 
evaluating the Postal Service's financial performance. In 
closing, while our finances have improved, as shown in the 
first quarter, we estimate a full year controllable loss of 800 
million, but that is down from 2.3 billion loss in 2023.
    By the way, over the last two or three years, not only have 
inflation hurt, our pension returns because of the negative 
real rates, but also has impacted our operating results in a 
tremendous way. Seventy percent of our costs are salary and 
benefits, and they are subject to call adjustments. Another 10 
percent are transportation costs, and they are subject to 
inflation, as we all know, from fuel prices, and we have been 
fighting that.
    This result that I have cited, which is an improvement, 
have taken into account dealing with those inflationary 
impacts. As I know earlier in implementing a restructure of 
this magnitude, there will be times when service falls short of 
our standards, but the Postal Service will move quickly to 
address them while our infrastructure is being modernized and 
our workforce stabilize. Simply put, in my view, the Delivering 
for America Plan is working, but it needs time to achieve these 
goals. With your help and support, we can continue down this 
path. I look forward to your questions.
    Chairman Peters. Thank you, Governor Martinez. Our third 
witness is Michael Kubayanda, and he is Chairman of the Postal 
Regulatory Commission (PRC). Which is the Postal Service's 
regulator. He has served in that role since January 2021. He 
was first appointed to the Commission and confirmed by the 
Senate in January 2019, and was confirmed for a second term in 
December 2021.
    Prior to his appointment, he served with the US Postal 
Service Office of Inspector General and the House Oversight 
Committee. Mr. Kubayanda, you are recognized for your opening 
remarks.

 TESTIMONY OF HONORABLE MICHAEL KUBAYANDA,\1\ CHAIRMAN, POSTAL 
                     REGULATORY COMMISSION

    Mr. Kubayanda. Thank you. Good morning Chair Peters, 
Ranking Member Paul and Members of the Committee. The Postal 
Regulatory Commission is a micro agency with a substantial 
mission providing transparency and accountability of the U.S. 
Postal Service. The Commission recently issued its compliance 
determination for 2023 and will soon issue two more reports.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Kubayanda appears in the Appendix 
on page 162.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The research is alarming. Service, performance, finances, 
and efficiency are moving in the wrong direction. These 
findings should raise concerns now with election scheduled for 
this fall and mail ballots expected to play a role. In Georgia, 
Virginia, Texas, and other States, service quality has 
continued to decline.
    Individual letters and cards mailed within the Atlanta 
area, which should arrive in a generous two-day window, met 
that standard only 16 percent of the time in March. Atlanta and 
Richmond have new processing plants under 2021 strategy, which 
was meant to make the Postal Service self-sustaining and high 
performing.
    Three years later, the Postal Service does not appear to be 
closer to meeting those goals. While some disruption should be 
expected with these network changes, the bottleneck in Georgia 
does suggest some underlying problems. Hopefully, service in 
Atlanta is an outlier and will rebound soon, but national 
service is also subpar and trend in the wrong direction. Some 
context helps in understanding these service problems.
    First, the Postal Service has relaxed service standards in 
recent years, which should make it easier to achieve a high on 
time percentage. Second, the official numbers may actually 
under count delays experienced by mailers and recipients. The 
postal strategy calls for centralized plans, which increase the 
time from when a customer gives mail to the Postal Service 
until the first scan. This can take place in a different State. 
The Postal Service has also decided to stop picking up mail 
from some post offices in the evening.
    The official metrics, therefore, may actually under count 
delivery times by days, even when the network is operating 
smoothly. The Commission is working to understand and address 
these issues. Some parts of the postal strategy do make 
intuitive sense, especially at first. One might assume that 
lower standards, operational changes and slower service have 
allowed the Postal Service to cut spending, improve efficiency, 
and become self-sustaining. They have not up to this point.
    Costs have not been reduced, even though mail volume has 
declined. Efficiency fell by a historic amount of four percent 
last year. In 2020, the Commission changed a price cap 
established by a postal reform law which had locked the cap 
into place for 10 years. That new regulation, as well as a 
reform law in 2022, provided a boost of over $100 billion to 
the postal balance sheet.
    With that help and the new strategy, the Postal Service 
planned to break even in 2023. Instead, the agency lost over $6 
billion, with the caveats that Chairman Martinez mentioned this 
morning. I understand that postal employees are working harder 
than ever, and that postal management remains committed to its 
present course. The Commission lacks the direct legal authority 
to stop it.
    I hope the Postal Service can turn around in its 
performance, and I encourage its leaders to be transparent with 
stakeholders, Congress, and oversight bodies as they attempt to 
do so. Voters and election officials, for example, must know 
the amount of time needed to deliver ballots. Congress created 
the advisory opinion process is one venue for such 
transparency.
    The Commission relies on stakeholder input and detailed 
analysis by its staff to understand the impact of network 
changes. Advisory opinions, identify potential concerns, and 
offer recommendations for addressing them. Commission advisory 
opinions in 2021 and 2022 noted concerns that were not fully 
addressed. These include the potential for late delivery of 
medications, unrealistic projections of cost savings, and lack 
of communication with stakeholders.
    We have seen these issues pop up again in headlines and in 
data, as well as in the OIG's recent audit of Richmond. A new 
advisory opinion makes sense as the Postal Service ramps up the 
national rollout of new processing plants and transportation 
options. These changes are clearly having an impact on service. 
Postal leadership has pointed out that the Commission has 
stopped or slowed down Postal Service's work. While I believe 
the need for oversight is readily apparent, the Commission has 
actually streamlined regulation to support the postal ecosystem 
where that's appropriate.
    Last year, the Commission approved negotiated service 
agreements (NSAs), which are specialized contracts between the 
Postal service and its customers in 10 days on average, despite 
having a staff of fewer than 100 people, that is fast and 
flexible regulation where it's warranted. The Commission stands 
ready to work with postal leadership and stakeholders to 
preserve the postal system consistent with the law and the 
public interest. Thank you.
    Chairman Peters. Thank you, Chairman Kubayanda. Our final 
witness is Tammy Hull. She is the Inspector General of the U.S. 
Postal Service. The Governors of the Postal Service appointed 
her to that position in 2018. Prior to her appointment, Ms. 
Hull served as the Acting Inspector General (AIG) and the 
Deputy Inspector General (DIG), and has served as the OIG since 
2005. Ms. Hull you are recognized for your opening comment.

 TESTIMONY OF TAMMY HULL,\1\ INSPECTOR GENERAL, UNITED STATES 
                         POSTAL SERVICE

    Ms. Hull. Thank you. Good morning, Chair Peters, Ranking 
Member Paul and Members of the Committee. Thank you for 
inviting me to discuss our work. The Postal Service issued its 
Delivering for America Plan three years ago, and is now 
accelerating network changes across the country. The OIG is 
committed to keeping pace with these changes and providing 
robust oversight and transparency.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ The prepared statement of Ms. Hull appears in the Appendix on 
page 171.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We have completed several audits related to the plan and 
more are in progress. We are finding that as the Postal Service 
implements these changes, significant operational issues are 
arising that affect service to customers and take time to 
resolve. Our work is showing that better local coordination and 
execution could likely prevent some of this disruption.
    Last September, we issued an audit examining the initial 
Sorting and Delivery Centers (S&DCs) in Florida, Georgia, 
Texas, Massachusetts, and New York. Overall, we found these 
facilities operated successfully, but there were opportunities 
for improvement. The Postal Service did not communicate 
sufficiently with high volume customers, often providing 
information at the last minute.
    In addition, some facilities opened before renovations were 
complete, so employees had to work around construction 
projects. Transportation changes also delayed delivery to P.O. 
Box customers leading to complaints. The Postal Service 
launched its first regional processing and distribution center 
(RP&DC) last July at an existing plant in Richmond, Virginia. 
Our recent audit of the repurposed facility found significant 
problems.
    Prior to making changes, the Postal Service had not 
addressed staffing and other issues that we had raised in our 
2021 and 2022 audits of the facility. Transportation planning 
for the new facility was also insufficient, leading to a 700 
percent increase in extra trips. In addition, on-the-ground 
operations did not always match the new integrated plan for the 
Richmond plant and its supporting facilities. This was partly 
due to inadequate coordination with local management and 
ongoing changes after the launch.
    Local management said they did not fully understand the new 
mail flow within the facility and were not solicited for input. 
The Postal Service also did not hold public input meetings for 
the Richmond changes. We examined whether the Postal Service 
was required to provide public notice and found its policy was 
unclear. The Postal Service said its decision not to provide 
public notice complied with its longstanding interpretation of 
the law, but this interpretation was not documented in policy.
    Three months after the opening of the RP&DC, the Postal 
Service made an additional change within the region covered by 
the Richmond facility. For the first time it implemented its 
local transportation optimization initiative. Under this 
initiative, at some post offices, collection mail received 
throughout the day is held overnight to reduce the number of 
trips and associated costs.
    In the Richmond region, 86 percent of the affected zip 
codes were in rural areas, potentially leaving these rural 
customers with slower service. Following implementation First-
Class Mail on-time service performance in the Richmond region 
dropped about 21 percentage points to 65 percent. 
Unfortunately, we cannot isolate how much of the service 
decline resulted from this initiative compared to other events 
such as peak season.
    As the Postal Service expands this transportation 
initiative to other locations, we will monitor it and other 
network changes. We have audits currently underway of the 
rollout of new RP&DCs in Georgia and Oregon, and additional 
S&DCs. We will evaluate implementation challenges that could 
both reduce service and increase the risk that the Postal 
Service may not achieve its potential savings.
    We also continue to focus on service performance more 
broadly and recently reviewed clusters of facilities in 
Missouri, Minnesota, North Dakota, California, and Washington 
D.C. to evaluate service issues and recommend solutions. 
Additionally, following media reports of undelivered packages, 
we visited a South Houston facility in January and found 
384,000 pieces of delayed mail and mostly packages.
    The Postal Service had moved operations from another plant, 
but staffing, equipment, and logistics were not aligned with a 
new workload. Our recent report details these issues. Another 
critical focus area for us this year is the Postal Service's 
readiness for the November election, particularly as network 
changes are made.
    We plan to release our election mail readiness audit in 
late summer and we will conduct a separate audit of Postal 
Service ballot processing during the November election. As we 
did in 2020, OIG auditors and investigators will make hundreds 
of visits to delivery units and plants around the country to 
observe operations and flag problems. We want to help ensure 
the Postal Service continues to deliver for voters. Thank you 
for the opportunity to share our work, and I am happy to answer 
questions.
    Chairman Peters. Thank you, Ms. Hull. We have a lot to 
unpack here, and we look forward to having a very open 
discussion in the time we have remaining together. Postmaster 
General DeJoy, as we have heard and you mentioned, and others 
have heard, the Postal Service made a number of changes in two 
very large facilities in Richmond, Virginia as well as Atlanta, 
Georgia.
    Unfortunately, that implementation, as we heard from Ms. 
Hull, has caused some problems and service disruptions during 
that time. I have the chart\1\ here for folks who are in the 
audience.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ The chart referenced by Senator Peters appears in the Appendix 
on page 175.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    One time service declined after the Postal Service 
implemented changes in Richmond and unfortunately is still 
unreliable, as you can see from the chart here. Atlanta is 
particularly problematic where we saw service plummet. In fact 
inbound First-Class Mail has dropped to only 36 percent on 
time. In addition, cost savings have not been realized. 
Estimated the Richmond facility, for example, incurred about $8 
million in unexpected cost as a result of some of these 
changes.
    My question for you, sir, is given these service delays and 
increased cost is the Postal Service still moving forward with 
these planned network changes? And you think it's prudent now 
to perhaps try to evaluate exactly what happened in these two 
locations to make any changes that may be necessary before you 
continue to roll it out on a nationwide basis?
    Mr. DeJoy. Yes. First of all you are correct in regards to 
the service deteriorating. We recognize that. We apologize to 
the constituents that have received that service, but in the 
long term, if we do not make these changes, that will be every 
day, everywhere around the Nation.
    The problems that we are having with regard to both 
facilities being open have nothing to do with the fact that we 
want to process packages with a conveyor rather than by hand. 
That we want to fill trucks and have it run 90 percent full 
instead of 30 percent full.
    It has nothing to do with how we want to make one trip in 
the 300 miles away to pick up no mail versus two trips a day to 
pick up no mail. A host of other operational and strategic 
initiatives that we have in the plan that enable us to compete 
with private industry, because that's the law that you all have 
us operating under.
    To the extent of the other problems that manifested, this 
is an organization that has not engaged in change in over 15 
years, right? We are taking longstanding broken practices and 
an less than engaged management style and trying to transition 
from losing $137 billion over the last 15 years to operate like 
Federal Express (FedEx) or United Parcel Service (UPS).
    The fact is, issues that we had here were management issues 
on the ground, employee attendance issues, and basic management 
tactics. I am quite confident. I see the whole team getting 
better, understanding the transition that we have to make, and 
committing more to the transition that we have to make.
    I say, sir, we do not have another choice, but to carry on 
is a good plan. It's a simple plan, right? We have $20 billion 
worth of deferred maintenance. That's what we are fixing.
    Chairman Peters. Postmaster General, I understand that 
change is very hard, especially in a very large organization 
it's incredibly difficult. The point that I am making is that 
we look at these two facilities with the changes that you have 
made that have had disruptions and problems. You are not, you 
said that's going to happen throughout the system in the long 
term, yet we are not seeing that currently in these others.
    We are seeing these two particular facilities with these 
changes are having this kind of impact. I am not against 
change. You and I have had that discussion before. Change is 
good. But if you are starting to see that kind of impact with 
these changes, in these two facilities, is it time just to 
pause a little bit and say, OK, what do we need to tweak? What 
do we need to change that's not going to result in this. I am 
not going to bury my head in the sand. Say, you got to stay in 
the status quo. We know that's not working?
    Mr. DeJoy. I understand what you are asking me now. Sir, we 
have paused, we have changed, we have reorganized, we have 
committed additional resources. I have taken my foot on and off 
the pedal as appropriate to capitalize on the momentum that we 
have in making the change, the time period that we have before 
we run out of cash. But recognizing some of the weaknesses that 
we have in deploying. I am very sensitive to that, and have 
stopped many initiatives.
    There were a few more plants supposed to roll out this 
year. But also, within the organization, some of the local 
things, these plants will succeed. We are three months, four 
months into Atlanta, we moved almost 2000 people from 10 
locations around the city into one, right? We went from 
processing packages by hand to doing a million a night, right?
    I had a conversation with the Richmond OIG last week. 
There's a different attitude within the organization there in 
terms of learning how to process using in a refurbished plant, 
using the proper tools, using the proper instruction. That was 
void. That is part of what we are trying to rebuild here. 
Engagement with our workforce and standard management 
practices. But we are not doing this blindly with an intent to 
destroy service.
    Chairman Peters. No, and I would never imply that, but I 
heard you say that you are slowing things down. You are taking 
a look to see as those numbers improve that we have 
transparency. As those numbers improve, which you contend will 
happen with your changes in both Richmond and Atlanta, you are 
slowing down the implementation around the country. Is that 
accurate to say?
    Mr. DeJoy. I would have construction underway. I am mindful 
of the transition to avoid circumstances like that, and that's 
how I will deploy myself. Those two plants, Richmond and 
Atlanta, and the whole Georgia area, will be the finest running 
parts of the organization very shortly. All right. We have to 
allow time to transition. There are consequences. I did not 
create this problem that exists or this trajectory. We have to 
move out and we are very mindful of this. We will make every 
effort to stop that from happening.
    Chairman Peters. I appreciate that. Great. Thank you. The 
Postal Service recently made another change that's causing 
issues, and that's the local transportation optimization. 
Inspector General Hull, you mentioned that in your opening 
comments and the change was implemented in Richmond, which the 
Postmaster General mentioned, but your office published a 
report yesterday, which you referenced as well showing it had 
contributed service declines there briefly. Does this change 
have concerns for you, particularly in rural areas which are 
tends to be folks that are most vulnerable to these kinds of 
changes?
    Ms. Hull. Yes. We did issue the report yesterday. We found 
that when the Postal Service implemented this in October, that 
service declined by 21 percentage points. In the majority of 
the zip codes that were impacted by this local transportation 
optimization, the vast majority were in rural areas. We have 
some concerns, we will be continuing to look at that. But right 
now, that was the first one that had been implemented, and we 
saw that the service decline was most significant in those 
rural areas.
    Chairman Peters. Great. We will explore that further in the 
remaining time. Ranking Member Paul, you are recognized for 
your questions.
    Senator Paul. Mr. DeJoy, the post office, I guess, before 
postal reform was losing about a billion dollars a quarter, 
about $4 billion a year.
    Mr. DeJoy. That's correct sir.
    Senator Paul. Now it's estimated to lose maybe 1.5 billion 
a quarter, or about $6 billion this year. It does not sound 
like a whole lot of success with people talking about going in 
the right direction. The question is, we have known for, I 
don't know, a decade, two decades that what the post office 
sells is diminishing. First-Class Mail is a granted monopoly, 
but it goes down every year, and I think last year it went down 
nine percent.
    You have a declining revenue source that you make money 
from. Then you decided to add 125,000 jobs that were part-time 
jobs and did not have all of the ramifications of government 
employment, which are often 50 percent more expensive than 
part-time jobs. Why, in a sort of a failing environment of 
declining sales and perpetual death, I mean, just into the 
future as far as the eye can see, would you want to add more 
government employees?
    Mr. DeJoy. Yes. The first year I got here, we lost nine and 
a half billion dollars. The year before that we lost pretty 
much about the same, losses over seven years were $90 billion. 
To your point and we have had this discussion on why convert 
people, because it was not working, sir, in the environment, we 
were in the middle of a pandemic, right?
    We had about 60 percent availability of employees. The 
management at that particular time treated these people as 
disposable people, right? We had significant overtime and in 
the middle of the pandemic and trying to move forward. I have a 
growth plan and it's growth in the package business. In fact, 
we are growing in the package business. But, I have converted 
150,000 people to full-time positions because that was the 
right thing to do in this availability to bring stability to 
the organization.
    Senator Paul. Basically, adding significant costs in an era 
of perpetual debt.
    Mr. DeJoy. No, because of the stability, right? Because of 
the attrition rate that we have in the organization? I am about 
20,000 people less than what we had when we came in here. I am 
50 million hours less to do more business today than when I 
walked in the door. That's operational management principles, 
sir. That's an obvious if you are not in this type of 
environment, right? It's something that we had to stabilize the 
workforce.
    We will continue to hire and staff. Right now, we have 
30,000 less pre-career people, 20,000 more full-time people, 
and the stability of the organization peaks. When I got here, 
we were hiring 40 and 50,000 people for peak. We hired 8,000 
last peak, and we did 133 million more packages than the peak 
before.
    Senator Paul. The debts continue to mount. I do not see a 
whole lot of change. This 10-year projection is rosy on things, 
but the immediate debts are getting worse.
    Mr. DeJoy. Now, sir, we have taken over so that 50 million 
hours is like 4 billion. It's like 5 billion--a couple of 
billion dollars out of transportation. We have grown our 
revenues significantly to 6.9 billion.
    Senator Paul. Private corporations face these kind of 
problems and when they do, they do not add to their labor 
costs. They try to adjust. If you are in Washington State and 
you have union labor and it's costing you too much, you expand 
into South Carolina and you hire non-Union labor. It's sort of 
the same principle with government unions. Your costs are 70 to 
80 percent is labor. You compare yourself to UPS, which is also 
unionized. They are about 50 percent cost of labor. FedEx, non-
unionized, about 38 percent.
    Everybody admits that the labor cost is a big function of 
the problem, not only in the immediate labor cost.
    Mr. DeJoy. I have not admitted that.
    Senator Paul. Not only in the immediate labor costs, but in 
the pensions, as Mr. Martinez pointed out. But those are labor 
costs because you have a bigger labor force, you are going to 
have bigger pension liabilities. But Mr. Martinez, in the 
private world, you have to account if your pension is short and 
you are running a private company and you have to make up for 
the pension with revenue from your company, you count that, 
right? You, count that in how your company is doing for the 
year?
    Mr. Martinez. Right now we are the defined contribution 
plans. They are now in defined benefit plans, which is what we 
have here.
    Senator Paul. You would not add more people if you were in 
private business, you would not add more people to an 
undefined. You would have to add them to a defined benefit 
because you do not want unlimited costs, you want a limitation 
on costs.
    Mr. Martinez. Defined benefits is when you are obligated to 
pay a certain amount to the employees.
    Senator Paul. Right.
    Mr. Martinez. Most private sector companies today are 
defined contributions.
    Senator Paul. Right. But the thing is that by adding 
125,000, you are adding to the problem. You are not actually 
taking away from the problem.
    By adding permanent employees, that will be the same sort 
of plan.
    Mr. Martinez. But that's a different question.
    Senator Paul. It's part of the problem. You have a pension 
problem, right? An underfunding of the pension?
    Mr. Martinez. We have a problem created by government on 
us.
    Senator Paul. You have an underfunded pension and you have 
to account for it, but you are adding more people onto that 
traditional pension. We have a pension problem in Kentucky, and 
it's the same kind of thing. It's a defined benefit versus 
defined contribution. Most people get what they put in. They do 
not just sort of get an amount on and on and on. You get what 
you put in based on the contribution. But you are not changing 
that model. You are adding more people to that model.
    Mr. Martinez. The pension model was thrust on us----
    Senator Paul. I know, but you are adding 125,000 new people 
to the pension model.
    Mr. Martinez. But that's a different package.
    Senator Paul. You complain about that but you are adding 
employees to it. I do not think you are making your situation 
any better. It is not what a private corporation would do.
    Mr. Martinez. Well the other corporation is not obligated 
to be in every single delivery point in the United States.
    Senator Paul. Most private corporations do not have a 
monopoly either. There is that as well.
    Mr. Martinez. Monopoly is declining.
    Senator Paul. But here's my point. When you get to the 
pensions being a problem, and you say, most of this is 
generated by pensions and past pensions, and this was all 
thrust upon you, that's fine. But you are adding people to that 
problem. When you add 125,000 people to it, you are making your 
problem worse, not better in the long run.
    In our State, what we do is we are hiring people with a 
different pension plan. They give to a 401k and they are going 
to get what they put into it. And that's how you convert. But 
that's what you should be doing. You should not hire any new 
employees, every year you should get smaller. You should put 
people into a different type of a pension plan.
    Mr. Martinez. We can have a discussion about that, but we 
need legislation for that then.
    Senator Paul. No, you do not need legislation to privately 
contract. You are converting from the one thing that actually 
works at the post office, and that is privately contracting 
people who are not in the government union.
    It is the only way under today's rules, and I would change 
the rules. I would try to fix your pension. Your other point 
is, is that the pension causes so many of these costs. When you 
actually look at the pension, you say, well, we have to buy 
only treasuries. This last year's been the best year for 
treasuries in the past 10 years.
    Mr. Martinez. I respectfully disagree with that.
    Senator Paul. Because interest rates have risen, you have 
been in a negative interest environment.
    Mr. Martinez. Do you know how the treasury invests?
    Senator Paul. You also have interest rates rising, it's 
better than any other year you have had.
    Mr. Martinez. Do you know how treasury invests our pension 
assets? Do you know, I respectfully ask you the question?
    Senator Paul. I can't answer you.
    Mr. Martinez. I will tell you. We turn over the money and 
they basically put it in a latter portfolio of 15 years. We are 
locked into a rate. The OIG report, and you might be able to 
correct me, I think our average return in 2022 was like 3.4 
percent or something in that area.
    Senator Paul. Right. That's probably better than it was 
five years ago, it would be much less.
    Mr. Martinez. 3.4 percent when inflation is running at 
eight percent.
    Senator Paul. No, I am not saying it's great. It is still a 
terrible investment. Nothing makes sense about the pension 
program. I am not here to defend your pension program.
    Mr. Martinez. What's your question?
    Senator Paul. I am against your pension program, but I am 
against putting more people in it so you do not quite get it. 
You want to quibble over the pension program getting this 
because you are adding more people to it. You need to add less 
people to it, and you need to convert your labor force. It is 
the only way you can survive. Otherwise, we just keep doling 
out more massive subsidies to you.
    Mr. DeJoy. Senator, we have not added 125,000 people. We 
have less employees than we did before. We had 40,000 people a 
year.
    Senator Paul. Your DFA says you want add 150,000 and you 
have added over 100,000 to the government union.
    Mr. DeJoy. That's not my plan. We have used 50 million less 
work hours this year to do the job. Long range, we will size 
our workforce for the work we have to do. That is part of the 
plan.
    Chairman Peters. Senator Johnson, you are recognized for 
your questions.

              OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHNSON

    Senator Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I will start with 
Mr. Martinez. As we are talking about pensions and investments, 
when you hold a U.S. Treasury and it's at low interest rate and 
the interest goes up, the value of that bond goes down, 
correct?
    Mr. Martinez. Goes down.
    Senator Johnson. Do you have to recognize that on your 
income statement or because you are holding these things in 
maturity, do you not recognize that loss?
    Mr. Martinez. We will do that indirectly. OPM, and not us, 
not our auditors, calculate actuarially what our amortization 
of unfunded pensions are. To the extent that our value goes 
down, then that cost goes up theoretically--but I do not know. 
They tell us what it is that we have to put in.
    Senator Johnson. Yes, I would be surprised if you had to 
down in value because you are holding to maturity. You are just 
getting hit by the fact that you are earning a very low rate of 
return versus what's available in the marketplace.
    By the way, the comment you made in terms of the $800 
billion of lost opportunity, had you invested that in just a 
normal type of balanced fund would have also been true. For 
social security, had we not spent that money and invested that 
in--I know it did not exist at the time--ETF, or some kind of a 
Dow Jones index fund, we would have $7 or $8 trillion in real 
assets, but we did not do that. We spent the money, it's gone. 
But that's a different point.
    Mr. Martinez. If like we had been able to invest like 
Amtrak or TVA on a diversified portfolio, that surplus would 
have been money that we would not have had to put into the 
pension fund, but rather on our capital investments.
    Senator Johnson. This gets me to my next point, and it's 
the constraints that the Postmaster General talked about. 
Basically, you are operating and reporting to a 400-or 535-
member board of directors here that impose on you certain 
business conditions that you would not recognize or you would 
not operate that way if you are in the private sector, right? 
Mr. Postmaster General.
    Mr. DeJoy. We have laws that we need to follow and have 
different impacts on us, used to protect the monopoly that no 
longer exists.
    Senator Johnson. Right. The question I have is what are 
those major constraints? Let us get them on the table. What 
does Congress force you to do that in any kind of rational 
private sector business you would not do because you keep 
losing your you know what?
    Mr. DeJoy. Yes. I think the first part was the pre-funding 
legislation that we worked together to get passed last year.
    Senator Johnson. Now you did get an infusion. I never would 
have thought this would happen. I was Chairman. $100 billion 
plus, to offload parts----
    Mr. DeJoy. Well, that's a perspective I do not share.
    Mr. Martinez. It was on cash adjustment through the balance 
sheet.
    Senator Johnson. By the way, how much of the liability were 
you relieved of? I am not up to speed on those numbers. Your 
total unfunded liability pension was over $200 billion, 
correct?
    Mr. DeJoy. We still have the same obligations long term to 
pay for our retirement.
    Mr. Martinez. It is not having to recognize it.
    Mr. DeJoy. It is just the pre-funding legislation that was 
passed in 2006. Probably the dagger in the heart of the Postal 
Service. Between what it did with regard to the pre-funding, 
the price fixing that it instituted--that the PRC oversaw--and 
through basic division, you were seeing it every year. $10 
billion losses, $20 billion loss.
    Senator Johnson. We talked about that. Again, that was an 
insane bill that was passed in 2000.
    Mr. DeJoy. There is a whole bunch of the same things that 
have consequences.
    Senator Johnson. Again, that's the 535-member genius board 
that you report to.
    Mr. DeJoy. I appreciate the legislation that you passed. 
That gave us room to move forward. I would have liked to see 
CSRS signed off, it did not. Moving forward in operational and 
financial revenue producing issues, I think the Postal Service 
Regulatory Commission needs to be looked at. In terms of what 
their impact and effect, I have a Senate-confirmed board, a 
Senate-confirmed Commission. This organization is not set up to 
deal with what this Congress is asking us to do, which is 
compete in the market. We have $39 billion worth of mail. It 
costs us $65 billion to deliver it. The only way to make that 
up is by driving costs out.
    Senator Johnson. Which you are not allowed to do in many 
cases. I mean, you are constrained on what you can do.
    Mr. DeJoy. We are growing the package market and driving 
cost now, too. Go look at the difference in the Atlanta. Go 
look at the overall strategy. Before, no strategy existed. This 
was a randomly deployed haphazard organization that had no 
mission. There's a purpose within the organization now. People 
are engaged in terms of trying to make this work. The strategy 
is not that complex, it's simple. Load your trucks.
    Senator Johnson. Congress does, what it always does, I mean 
they will throw more money at the problem. If you get $10's of 
billions thrown at you, you can use it to some effective 
impact.
    Mr. DeJoy. That's what I have asked for. I think we have an 
operational path forward to solve a lot of these problems. It 
is not without consequence as we do it. But, I am positive 
about what to do, everybody's engaged, including our union 
leadership.
    Senator Johnson. Yes. I would really like to fully 
understand what those constraints are. You cannot continue to 
do what we keep doing in the declining market environment.
    But anyway, I do have one other question submitted by one 
of my constituents who actually produced the blue boxes. 
Apparently, you are going to hire security blue boxes, and they 
are just asking, are you going to be issuing, the specs on 
those, some kind of strategic plan so they can plan on it, and 
deliver those blue boxes to you as a cost effective manner as 
possible?
    Mr. DeJoy. I think we have purchased about 25,000 high 
security boxes. We have a deployment plan. If you want, I could 
get with a retail and delivery group and inspection service.
    Senator Johnson. Yes. Could you get us in contact with 
somebody?
    Mr. DeJoy. Not somebody wants to break into them, is it?
    Senator Johnson. Pardon?
    Mr. DeJoy. It's not somebody who wants to break into them, 
is it?
    Senator Johnson. I do not think so. I knew this is a 
cooperative type of question, but thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Chairman Peters. Thank you. Senator Hassan recognized for 
your questions.

              OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR HASSAN

    Senator Hassan. Thanks Chair Peters. Thanks to you and 
Ranking Member Paul for holding this hearing, which is 
particularly timely for New Hampshire because of the Postal 
Service's plans to move operations from the Manchester 
Processing and Distribution Center to Boston over the next 
year.
    Granite Staters reach out to my office daily about delivery 
issues that they are experiencing. This new plan from the 
Postal Service could exacerbate these issues by leading to more 
delayed mail deliveries, delayed absentee ballots, and job 
losses for postal employees. That is unacceptable.
    Two years ago, we passed the bipartisan Postal Service 
Reform Act to help the Postal Service achieve financial 
stability. In addition, Senator Collins and I worked together 
to help secure $10 billion in relief funds for the Postal 
Service during the pandemic.
    Congress took action to allow the Postal Service to achieve 
its core mission to deliver mail to every customer at least six 
days per week. But the Postal Service's current plan 
fundamentally lacks a commitment to service. Granite Staters 
and all Americans, deserve a new plan for reliable, timely 
postal delivery. This is true whether they live in rural or 
urban areas, whether they are waiting for a customer's check to 
come in, whether they are a grandparent waiting for a birthday 
card from their grandchild, or whether they are waiting for 
life saving medications.
    Let me start with a question to you, Inspector General 
Hull. A few years ago, the Postal Service hired an additional 
150 postal workers in New Hampshire based on an Inspector 
General report that I requested. I appreciate your partnership 
on that report and the work of your office. However, as I 
noted, service issues persist in New Hampshire. I am 
particularly concerned that moving critical operations from 
Manchester to Boston will result in significant delivery 
delays. I am also concerned that postal employees will face an 
impossible choice between commuting to Boston, and for those of 
you who do not know, this is ranked as one of the worst 
commutes in the country. You are talking about two hours each 
way for some of these employees, at least to be reliably on 
time at work. It's one of the worst commutes in the country. 
They are going to have face this choice to keep their jobs or 
leave the Postal Service altogether. Based on your 
observations, Inspector General, from previous consolidations, 
what can Granite Staters expect when operations move from 
Manchester to Boston? Specifically, what delays might customers 
see and what will postal employees experience?
    Ms. Hull. Yes, thank you, Senator Hassan, and I appreciate 
the opportunity to work with your staff on previous 
opportunities. I cannot speak to specifics on what will happen 
directly in New Hampshire, but I can tell you what we have seen 
so far. In Richmond, we have seen challenges, particularly in 
service performance, and there is a real need for a better pre-
implementation kind of ground game to get the employees on 
board so that they can understand exactly what the changes 
involve and how to get them engaged in supporting the change 
and working through what those service changes are going to 
entail.
    As far as employees go, I know a little bit about what that 
facility will be moved from and to, but I do not know how many 
of those employees will be retained at that local facility and 
how many of them will actually have to make decisions that you 
spoke of on, on where to go.
    But I think if the Postal Service can address some of the 
recommendations that we made in Richmond, we are in Atlanta 
right now, we will make some similar recommendations on what 
the challenges are. They can take these lessons learned and 
really focus before they actually implement the change, instead 
of after, and trying to recover from the service disruptions 
that have occurred.
    Senator Hassan. I appreciate that. I would also suggest 
that this is not necessarily about getting employees on board, 
it's about listening to employees. They are the experts in 
delivering mail. They are the experts in their States. They are 
the ones who know where a particular address is when somebody 
writes the wrong address on an envelope, they are the people 
who know this area. You might all start with listening to them 
about what they think the impacts will be on service. Service 
being the paramount obligation here.
    To Chairman Kubayanda, Northern New Hampshire Postal 
customers are not served by the Manchester facility. They are 
served by White River Junction, Vermont. Under the Postal 
Service's plans, operations at the White River Junction 
facility also could be consolidated. Now we have Manchester 
going to Boston under your plan, and here's the plan for White 
River Junction, it's going to Hartford, Connecticut 150 miles 
away.
    Now we are taking two of the Northern New England States in 
the northern part of those States, and just taking out any of 
these processing centers. For Granite Staters in the North 
Country in particular, the Postal Service is a lifeline. We are 
still working on getting high speed Internet to them. The roads 
are not optimal and cell service often is not great.
    The Postal Service remains particularly important up there, 
especially when you are talking about the delivery of 
medication and essential goods. It also connects people, and it 
is also critical resource for local businesses who rely on the 
Postal Service, because no surprise, FedEx and UPS will not 
deliver up there.
    The Postal Service is all we have. The Postal Regulatory 
Commission has the authority to ensure that the Postal Service 
meets its service obligations. How could the Postal Regulatory 
Commission use its authority to ensure that the Postal Service 
meets its service obligations, especially in rural areas like 
New Hampshire's North Country?
    Mr. Kubayanda. Senator, thank you for the question. I will 
say that the portion of the law that requires the Postal 
Service to consult with the Commission as it's implementing 
service standards is not one that has a lot of teeth. It's a 
requirement to consult. However, the Postal Service has the 
direct authority over its own operational and service 
strategies, and as you can see, they are quite aggressive in 
terms of exercising their autonomy.
    However, there are things that the Postal Regulatory 
Commission can do. The part of the law that has a little bit 
more teeth is the advisory opinion process in which the 
Commission issues an advisory opinion to the Postal Service. 
These are on the record proceedings where stakeholders can come 
in and lay out some of those issues that you have pointed to 
that will affect stakeholders.
    Then the Commission is able to do a deeper dive, to take 
into account all those different positions and issue 
recommendations. I have to commend our tiny staff did a 
tremendous job, and they identified all of the issues that we 
have seen: the issues with medications, lack of communication 
of stakeholders, and frankly over optimistic forecasts.
    I think that that advisory opinion process does have some 
teeth and a new advisory opinion might be warranted as you see 
this ramp up of Delivering for America. We also have direct 
authority to approve the service measurement system. I think 
that's a concern. As I mentioned in my testimony, we might be 
actually underestimating the delays in many cases. You hear the 
stories and also see the statistics heading in the wrong 
direction.
    That's something we are actually very interested in taking 
a look at. I will also say we recently opened up a docket to 
reconsider the rate making system, and one of the reasons we 
cited was service performance. That is one of the factors 
that's in the law as we are conducting this proceeding.
    Senator Hassan. I appreciate that, and thank you for your 
indulgence. Mr. Chair. again, this is about service. The Postal 
Service was established by our founders and is protected in the 
United States Constitution, because it's not just any private 
business. It has an obligation of service that is essential to 
our people and to our economy. Thank you.
    Chairman Peters. Senator Marshall, recognized for your 
questions.

             OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR MARSHALL

    Senator Marshall. Thank you, Mr. Chair. As I listened to 
your testimonies, I am just reminded that no good deed goes 
unpunished, and I do not doubt the sincerity of you and your 
employees wanting to deliver a good product at an affordable 
price for the American taxpayers. I want to start off with 
something very positive to report. As you all know, there's a 
fentanyl explosion going on across this country, and we are 
losing 300 Americans every day to fentanyl poisoning. We have 
lost 250,000 Americans to fentanyl poisoning.
    Now criminals are using the United States Postal Service 
and other private carriers to send those fentanyl tablets to 
different locations, including in Kansas. I am proud to report 
that your cooperation, the U.S. Postal Service's cooperation 
with the Kansas Bureau of Investigation and their canines, they 
have been able to capture 66,000 fentanyl pills. I sure hope 
the other public entities as well as the private entities, are 
all cooperating with this effort as well to stop this horrible 
epidemic.
    My first question or comment would be to the Postmaster 
General. The city of Olathe is perhaps the fastest growing city 
in Kansas. It has a thriving downtown. Unfortunately, there's a 
railroad right through the middle of downtown, and a very busy 
postal office there as well. The city would like to move that 
post office somewhere else and they are willing to throw some 
money at it as well. And so far, they have met resistance from 
that. I am sure this is a blip on your screen, Mr. Postmaster 
General, but are you aware of the situation in Olathe?
    Mr. DeJoy. No, I am not. But I am aware of other requests 
like this from other places.
    Senator Marshall. We would sure appreciate your office 
taking a little closer look at it. Again, you have a city 
that's willing to cooperate, help pay for part of the 
situation. I think your operations would be more efficient if 
your drivers were not coming in and out of that traffic jam as 
well.
    Mr. DeJoy. Yes, I will take a look into it, sir.
    Senator Marshall. Thank you. The next question is going to 
be directed toward the Inspector General Hull, as well. As you 
may know, the services and the Kansas City Metro area are of 
great concern as well. What I understand is maybe a third of 
the mail is late, taking over three days. I believe that's in 
your report. Are you familiar with that report in Kansas City 
and what were your conclusions concisely?
    Ms. Hull. Yes. What we saw in the Kansas, Missouri area, 
and we did some work, I think it's been about probably seven or 
eight months ago now, but a lot of the problems were related to 
staffing and an inability to retain staff in the delivery units 
primarily.
    As a result, some of the routes were not being delivered 
every day because they just were understaffed in some of those 
locations. Some of it is due to the inability to hire quickly 
and also the challenges in the labor force where wages have 
increased maybe in some places faster than the Postal Service 
wages.
    Senator Marshall. I am going to go through some numbers 
here, and I wish I could give them to you. You may want to 
write them down, but in 2001, the Postal Service employed 
775,000 people and were delivering 103 billion First-Class Mail 
a year, 775,000 people, 103 billion First-Class pieces of mail.
    In 2013, your numbers bottomed out from employees of 
491,000 and 65 billion First-Class Mail were delivered. Then in 
2023, 525,000. Increased numbers from the decade before, 
525,000 employees and 45 billion pieces of mail.
    You point here that there is a problem in a particular area 
hiring folks, but yet the number of people employed by the post 
office are going up, the volume is less than half of what it 
was before. I certainly understand the economic ramifications, 
but can you connect those two pieces in any way, shape, or 
form?
    Ms. Hull. Looks like a disconnect? I think the challenge is 
that the Postal Service is everywhere. They are in every 
neighborhood every day. You may see big, broad, nationwide 
numbers that look like one scenario, and that's one of the 
reasons that we do a lot of really focused local work, because 
every city, every location in America kind of has its own 
story.
    What we saw in the nationwide numbers are exactly what you 
gave, but in Kansas City specifically, they had real challenges 
in hiring in that location.
    All postals are not having problems filling positions, but 
in other places, it has been a real challenge.
    Senator Marshall. Postmaster General, if we could follow up 
on that in the private sector, I would assume that they would 
move some employees to there. They would figure out a way to 
make sure that that customer service is continued. What's your 
assessment of the situation?
    Mr. DeJoy. Two things. In 2001, 775,000, people, we did not 
have packages. Today, we have a whole bunch of packages that we 
are moving around the Nation. With regard to rural areas on 
delivery, it is pretty simple. An age-old labor position called 
the rural carrier associate is probably one of the most ill-
defined worst jobs in the Nation. It's the way we staff 
according to different rules that you have to work, everybody's 
off day and so on and so forth.
    We have been making aggressive efforts to try and change 
that process and use the formula method that enables us to 
rebalance people. We have done a lot of work in that.
    Senator Marshall. But with all due respect, I am not sure I 
would call Kansas City Metro area rural.
    Mr. DeJoy. Rural carriers with regard to what our 
definition of rural is.
    Senator Marshall. Kansas City is considered rural?
    Mr. DeJoy. This could be areas out in the Kansas City area 
that would be rural carrier.
    Senator Marshall. Last question to the Postmaster General, 
is there a disconnect between leadership positions and the 
execution of your plans? Do you feel a significant resistance 
from the political appointees or the non-political appointee? 
Why are we struggling?
    Mr. DeJoy. I think there's a disconnect from me and the 
organization when I walked in. Because I am trying to bring in 
commercial practices as required by law to deliver mail and 
packages in integrated matter and cover our costs. We had no 
effort, no practice that did that. We had a random, haphazard, 
unmanaged system. I have reorganized probably 13 times since I 
have been there in different types of positions to find a 
balance.
    I have a leadership team that's very much engaging, and now 
we will bring it out into the field. We have made significant 
gains. We delivered the Covid test kits to 165 million 
addresses across the country within two days. In time of crisis 
we have made significant gains as we engage in this change. It 
is plant by plant, person by person, driver by driver. That has 
to take on a new way of working, a new way of thinking.
    It is easy to criticize when you show up at the crime scene 
and see the damage. But the path there is long and people are 
working very hard to change minds and hearts in terms of how we 
perform. They are in fact doing that. I am well qualified to 
recognize an organization that is changing how it executes. 
Versus the way we were stagnant and letting things just happen 
to us.
    That is why I am optimistic about the changes. It's 
probably to no one's satisfaction in this room or in this town, 
but it's what we got. This is the plan we are going with, we 
are moving forward, it is in fact having an impact, and it will 
make the Postal Service better.
    Chairman Peters. Senator Rosen, recognized for your 
questions.

               OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR ROSEN

    Senator Rosen. Thank you, Chair Peters, and I am going to 
quote you. IG Hull ``every location has a story.'' You just 
said that. I am going to talk about the story of Northern 
Nevada, Mr. DeJoy. I am extremely concerned about your proposal 
to downsize the only postal processing and distribution center 
in Northern Nevada, one of only two in my entire State.
    Your proposed plan includes transferring mail processing 
operations from Reno out of State to California, which will 
negatively impact mail delivery service for Nevadans. Under 
your proposal, if one of my constituents in Reno were to mail a 
birthday card to her mother who lives on the other side of 
town, the letter's going to be driven 130 miles over to 
Sacramento, California, and then send 130 miles back to Nevada 
to reach its final destination.
    I would like to understand what analysis you undertook to 
conclude that moving mail processing from Reno to Sacramento 
would actually benefit Nevadans. Your staff has continued to 
assert that your plan will not undermine delivery standards for 
Nevada, but they have not been able to explain how this is 
possible or provide me any of the data you have collected.
    Per what you just said, your team, they came and met with 
us, but they have not engaged with stakeholders in Nevada. I 
have talked to every one of our city councils, they have yet to 
receive data. Senator Cortez Masto, myself and Congressman 
Amodei did not receive it either. I would like to ask you a few 
yes or no questions, please, because my time is limited.
    Mr. DeJoy, the Postal Service standard for receiving and 
delivering mail in the Reno area is two days. The Postal 
Service is already failing to meet the standard with outbound 
mail and service in Reno, currently averaging about four days.
    I point this out because in order to take local mail from 
Reno to Sacramento and back to Reno, as you propose, your 
trucks will need to go through the Donner Pass. Hope you are 
familiar with that, it's on I80. It's the only way to get 
through Reno to Sacramento, which is subject to some of the 
most extreme weather conditions in the contiguous United 
States, with over 33 feet of snow annually, a hundred mile per 
hour winds and treacherous conditions during wildfire season.
    Mr. Dejoy, yes or no? Do you happen to know how many days 
per year, on average the Donner Pass closed due to extreme 
weather conditions?
    Mr. DeJoy. Why would I know that?
    Senator Rosen. You are the Postmaster General, and you are 
saying that you are going to go over this. Let me tell you, 
there were 15 road closures for over 37 days of closures just 
last winter alone. So yes or no, before you proposed your plan 
to move out of Reno, did you collect date on the potential 
impact to mail service from severe weather conditions on down 
or past? Yes or no, please?
    Mr. DeJoy. Yes. Within the organization.
    Senator Rosen. Can I have that data? Your team has refused 
to give that to us. We are the Oversight Committee. I believe 
the U.S. Congress has a right to this information.
    Mr. DeJoy. I will give you the data that we have.\1\ I will 
get with the team to give you the data that we have.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ The response to Senator Rosen's question appears in the 
Appendix on page 204.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Senator Rosen. Thank you. How do you plan to get the mail? 
Maybe you want to tell us how you plan to get the mail from 
Reno to Sacramento and back to Reno. When there's only one 
route, I say one route, I80 to take that 260 mile round trip 
when it's closed on an average of 37 days per year.
    Mr. DeJoy. Let me start with the fact that the we are 
investing significantly in the Reno facilities. We repurpose it 
for what we feel is the modern day need for the Postal Service. 
The mail that we are moving, only 10 percent of it will only 
move out----
    Senator Rosen. You want to sacrifice 10 percent of my folks 
in rural Nevada?
    I have rural Nevadans, veterans and seniors that still rely 
on this, that 10 percent, if it's your in the 10 percent, it's 
everything. A standard contingency plan here, Mr. DeJoy is not 
going to work. The extreme conditions in Sierra Nevada 
mountains require you to undertake an extensive analysis to 
ensure all Nevadans, all Nevadans, even that 10 percent get 
their mail on time. You do not get to sacrifice those living in 
my rural areas or subject to harsher weather in the name of 
cost savings. The Postal Service has an obligation to deliver 
to everyone.
    Let me ask you this. Before developing this plan to 
downsize the Reno facility and transfer operations to 
California, did you analyze how your proposed plan would impact 
Nevada seniors? Can you provide me that data here today? Yes or 
no please.
    Mr. DeJoy. We have a process to analyze the movement of 
mail.
    Senator Rosen. Have you done one that would impact my 
Nevada seniors?
    Mr. DeJoy. We have looked at that. We treat every delivery 
point the same.
    Senator Rosen. Do you have one for Nevada Seniors? So you 
did not look at how it would impact my seniors? That's 
unacceptable. If you did, I expect to see that data as soon as 
possible, hopefully by the close of business today, please. I 
have to assume the reason I do not have the data is because you 
instructed your staff not to provide it to me when we requested 
it last month.
    Mr. DeJoy. I think that's very inaccurate and presumptuous.
    Senator Rosen. It was not provided to me when I asked for 
it last month.
    And it was not provided when we asked for it last week.
    Mr. DeJoy [continuing]. I did not direct my staff to do 
anything with regard.
    Senator Rosen. Fair enough.
    What about the impact of your plan on Nevada's veterans? We 
have over 225,000 veterans in Nevada. Yes or no? Did you 
collect data on the impact of Nevada veterans?
    Mr. DeJoy Have delivered wherever their veterans live? This 
should have no impact.
    Senator Rosen. Will you provide me that data?
    Mr. DeJoy. We can provide our plan as to how the mail will 
be transported and transferred.
    Senator Rosen. You did not specifically see how it would 
impact Nevada veterans. That's actually unacceptable to me as 
well. Again, I asked for this information over a month ago,
    Mr. Dejoy. If the veteran lives at a delivery point in 
Nevada.
    Senator Rosen. Nevada, it's Nevada, sir, please say it 
correctly. It's Nevada.
    Mr. DeJoy. If a veteran lives at a delivery point, our 
intention is to give them the mail in a timely service that we 
have----
    Senator Rosen. You are not giving them in the timely 
service now. What makes you think it's going to go in four 
days? I hope to see the data by the end of the day, please.
    Mr. Dejoy, an inspector general audit, showed that the 
Postal Service implemented the same changes to processing and 
distribution center in Virginia. Service performance was not 
even included as a measure of success. This time around, did 
you conduct any analysis on how your proposed changes would 
impact mail delivery service time, specifically in northern 
Nevada? Yes or no, please.
    Mr. Dejoy. Those are two separate operations and separate 
types of transactions.
    Senator Rosen. I am assuming it's no. You did not feel that 
you had a due diligence to understand how Nevada senior 
citizens, veterans, small business owners in rural communities 
who depend on the post office for their lives and livelihoods.
    Mr. DeJoy. Senator, we intend to meet the service 
standards.
    Senator Rosen. You are not meeting it now, and you have 
refused----
    Mr. DeJoy. We intend to meet the standards.
    Senator Rosen [continuing]. To provide us the data of what 
you have made this assessment on. I hope to see that as quickly 
as possible. I would like to move on to the next question. 
Actually, I have 10 seconds. I will yield and we will wait for 
the second round. Thank you.
    Chairman Peters. Senator Lankford, you are recognized for 
your questions.

             OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR LANKFORD

    Senator Lankford. Thank you all. It's incredibly 
complicated. There's a lot that's going on. I had a 
conversation with someone sitting at a table last week that 
complained to me about where we had 67 cents at this point for 
a first class stamp. They complained to me about the cost of 
that.
    I said, I tell you what, I am going to hand you a letter 
and I am going to hand you 67 cents, and I would like you to 
take this to somebody in Anchorage, Alaska for me. They just 
smiled and said, point given. The complications of this is 
immense. I am also amazed as I have listened to other parts of 
the dais today about a $4 billion loss for the post office 
possibly, or maybe up to six, realizing that today this 
Congress overspent $4 billion.
    That's our current rate of burn a day right now. It's 
always interesting to me when we in Congress start criticizing 
any entity for overspending and where things are going because 
we have our own challenges on that. Saying all that, this is 
complicated. I get that. What I am always grateful for are 
specific solutions.
    Mr. Martinez, you brought a set of specific solutions to us 
on how to be able to handle debt and investing. Quite frankly, 
if the post office was allowed to be able to invest the same 
way just for Federal and retirees are able to invest, this 
would be very different. But the post office has a very 
different standard than what Federal retiree benefits actually 
have on it for the investment. Those are specific solutions. I 
appreciate that. I do have a couple things just to be able to 
bring up though, because as we walk through all of these 
different issues, I am trying to identify when this gets 
better.
    We have talked about Richmond, we have talked about Atlanta 
and the decline in the service turnaround. We have talked about 
the increased cost on it for the service turnaround time 
period. Mr. DeJoy, I know you have said over and over again, 
give us a little bit more time. The service will get better on 
it. What do you anticipate? Just take Atlanta for an example, 
because I have Tulsa and Oklahoma City. There's Bartleville, 
there's others that impact Oklahoma. They are about to walk 
through this process. Is it expectation that every one of these 
locations will see a decline and then it will increase as far 
as the delivery time period then?
    Mr. DeJoy. Atlanta and Richmond opened up other RP&DCs and 
they have not been as consequential. I expect these operations 
to be stabilized coming into the summertime. There are other 
aspects of things that we are doing that impact us, 
transportation initiatives to stop running 50,000 empty trucks 
around the country and so forth.
    There are a lot of things coming together that will prove 
this model will in fact work. I think, combined with coming up 
on the election, that we will slow down, and a lot of the moves 
will continue with the construction sites. These mail 
processing facility review (MPFRs) that we are talking about, 
like Reno and Tulsa, all will get investments into them to more 
appropriately serve the community and package industry, and a 
package business, and so forth. We are collecting all the data 
to put our project plan to roll out these transitions around 40 
locations. Most likely will not happen until the end of the 
first year. Nobody's going to have to commute to Boston. 
Nobody's going to have to commute to I forget where we are 
going in----
    Senator Lankford. Oklahoma City. Yes.
    Mr. DeJoy. Oklahoma City. We are putting money into these 
facilities that have significant deferred maintenance.
    Senator Lankford. Give me a little more specifics on the 
timeline. You are saying because of the election, there's going 
to be a pause to be able to make sure we get through all the 
elections delivered?
    Mr. DeJoy. These are 40 sites. They are smaller mail moves. 
We have done this in the past. This is separate than the 
rollout of the network and in Atlanta and so forth. This is 
just picking up outgoing mail, moving it to a place where we 
can consolidate all the outgoing mail that goes around the 
country and refurbishing the facilities and making them more 
appropriate for today's business that we are going to be doing.
    These are smaller moves, we do not expect to move people. 
Atlanta was moving 1500 people out of 10 plants.
    Senator Lankford. So, timeline, when you said you are 
pausing this, the changes based on the election----
    Mr. DeJoy. We are going to collect all the stuff, we will 
put a project plan together for all these sites, and most 
likely, work will start after the first of the year. The 
construction might start earlier on these locations.
    Senator Lankford. I have heard that there's no change in 
FTEs except by attrition in some of these locations in that. 
Tell me how that works?
    Mr. DeJoy. Yes. As I said, we attrite 40,000 people a year. 
We stop the hiring and the workforce comes down. I expect our 
package business to grow in these locations. We are not asking 
anybody to move. This is the way the format is put together. 
But I expect that we will treat our labor down to the level 
that we need, if it goes down. I am also expecting new demands 
and services that will in fact grow.
    We have a higher turnover rate on our pre-career. But we 
are not going to chase people out of these roles.
    Senator Lankford. It's the percentage in these locations 
that are experiencing change of supervisory to non-supervisory 
employees, will that percentage change?
    Mr. DeJoy. Say that again, sir?
    Senator Lankford. The percentage of change, the ratio of 
supervisory employees and non-supervisory employees in these 
changes, will there be a difference in the ratio there?
    Mr. DeJoy. No, I think those ratios stay pretty 
memorialized in terms of how we operate other than for 
vacancies or inability to hire. We try and staff to a 
complement profile and we will continue to do that. These are 
not bad things
    Senator Lankford. Right. Senator Paul brought the issue 
about insourcing, and I know there's been some areas for the 
part-time moving to full-time. I understand that based on the 
career changes on this, on the transportation side, there has 
been a move toward insourcing on transportation. What's the 
cost benefit on that for not having outsourcing for some of the 
transportation area?
    Mr. DeJoy. I think that the consequence of that is much 
exaggerated. We run 55,000 trucks a day on contracted side, we 
have made significant changes in terms of our supplier profile. 
We were having people go out of business every quarter that we 
are moving 5,000, 10,000 trucks around the country that is 
changing the profile there. On the local trips, servicing from 
processing plants to the new sorting and delivery centers. 
S&DCs we are converting to a new driver type postal vehicle 
operation (PVO) non commercial driver's license (CDL) driver. 
We can train within our own workforce and putting them in 
straight trucks, smaller vehicles, to more appropriately 
shuttle within the community to serve both the mail and package 
business is a common practice.
    At the end of the day, it will be more reliable. It will be 
just as cost effective. It's the right thing to do with all the 
transition that we are doing within some of my work complement. 
We added 500 conveyors that gets productivity out. We do not 
need as many hands. I need positives also, and this is a 
function. I have come out of industry. I have looked at our 
wage rates. I have looked at concluding the benefits. I know 
where labor is. I knew where labor is going before I got here. 
I was in that business.
    I think that the postal employee can be successful here. 
The service can be successful here. We have to change just 
about everything we are doing. Which is what we are embarking 
on. But I think it will be more reliable in terms of our 
service and flexibility.
    Chairman Peters. Senator Blumenthal, recognized for your 
questions.

            OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR BLUMENTHAL

    Senator Blumenthal. Thanks, Mr. Chair. Thank you all for 
being here. Mr. DeJoy, I want to focus on a number of local 
situations in Connecticut where the Postal Service controls 
property and where it could be more responsive. In fact, has 
been either non-responsive to me, or insufficiently responsive 
to me and members of our delegation.
    First in the town of Ridgefield, there is a specific piece 
of land behind the United States Postal Service facility. The 
town wants to use it for overflow parking in the downtown area. 
Small businesses are struggling to find parking spaces, that 
lot is empty at every hour of the day. Never seen a car in the 
lot. We have sent letters, representative Himes and I, to the 
Postal Service which has been nonresponsive to date. Are you 
familiar with these requests that we have made?
    Mr. DeJoy. No.
    Senator Blumenthal. Would you respond personally?
    Mr. DeJoy. Yes. I was just in Connecticut
    Senator Blumenthal. Make available this land to local 
business?
    Mr. DeJoy. I do not know, I will look at it and I will get 
back to you.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ The response to Senator Blumental's question appears in the 
Appendix on page 178.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Senator Blumenthal. OK.
    Mr. DeJoy. If I cannot do it, I will let you know why.
    Senator Blumenthal. Second. In the town of Litchfield, 
again, part of a post office parking lot is sought by the town 
for a temporary construction easement in connection with the 
development of the old courthouse into a new facility. I gather 
by the look on your face that you are not familiar with the 
Litchfield Postal property.
    Mr. DeJoy. I am not.
    Senator Blumenthal. Again, would you respond to me because 
so far there has been inadequate response from the Postal 
Service. In Milford, the town is redeveloping, its downtown. As 
part of that effort, they want to move the post office location 
and also redevelop the property. So far, the Postal Service's 
failed to respond to the town or to the developer of the 
property. In fact, there is a meeting today of the delegation 
to discuss the next steps.
    I know you may not be responsive, you may not be familiar 
with the details, but if you could respond to me personally 
about the Milford situation, Litchfield and Ridgefield, and 
finally, in Norwalk, again, the business community, which is 
vital to local development and jobs and economic progress, is 
creating a large plaza next to the United States Postal Service 
facility, as part of the redevelopment of South Norwalk.
    The city would like to acquire a portion of that land to 
create a connection to commercial garage. In return, provide 
the Postal Service with land to create a customer parking lot, 
which the facility certainly lacks, very much in your interest, 
the town's interest, the business community's interests. Postal 
service has been radio silent. Nonresponsive. Would you look 
into that situation in Norwalk?
    Mr. DeJoy. Yes. I will look into them all and I will get 
back to you.
    Senator Blumenthal. I want to turn to mail theft and 
assault on letter carriers, growing problem in our country in 
recent years. Last fall, the Postal Service's office of 
Inspector General released a report highlighting these very 
troubling trends, noting that carrier robberies and mail theft 
are on the rise across the country. In Connecticut, I have 
heard from postal employees, lots of them, about the serious 
impacts of assaults, robbery, they are increasingly vulnerable. 
These attacks have far reaching effects. I do not need to tell 
you, hardworking civil servants are afraid to do their jobs and 
American's confidence in our rail our mail system is 
undermined.
    I think there has to be action in response. I am supporting 
a measure called the Postal Police Reform Act of 2023, led by 
Senator Durbin and Senator Collins, bipartisan, it's a common 
sense bipartisan bill that simply clarifies an authority for 
postal police officers that can help address the threat of 
violence, assault, and robbery. I would like to ask you and the 
Inspector General for your support of this measure, the Police 
Postal Police Reform Act.
    Mr. DeJoy. Yes. I would say that we have done a lot over 
the last year with regard to stepping up activities around the 
country on postal crime. I have 600 postal police officers in 
the country, that's hardly enough to have any impact on the 
260,000 routes and 300,000 carriers I have running around the 
country. We use our postal police to protect our facilities 
where our people and mail are, and I do not have enough of 
that. I am stepping up the action on that.
    There are places where we have a thousand people and no 
security. That's where we are trying to redirect it. But I will 
read the bill and there's a legislative requirement that we 
cannot patrol the streets.
    Senator Blumenthal. Do you think that it remains a problem?
    Mr. DeJoy. I think that crime in the city streets doesn't--
--
    Senator Blumenthal. No. I am talking about crime against 
your employees.
    Mr. DeJoy. Yes.
    Senator Blumenthal. Your civil servants, they are being 
assaulted, are they not?
    Mr. Dejoy. They are.
    Senator Blumenthal. Ms. Hull, do you think that the Postal 
Service is doing enough?
    Ms. Hull. As you mentioned, we did the workings, issued the 
report in September. We identified some additional things that 
the Postal Service could do to address the mail theft issue. We 
did not specifically address the postal police problem because 
we wanted to see more locally what was happening locally in 
various locations. We followed up, we were just finishing up 
some work in Queens, some around the country in different local 
areas to see what problem really is. Because again, kind of 
depends on each location, where the real hotspots are and what 
solutions might be available there.
    Senator Blumenthal. Isn't better law enforcement key?
    Ms. Hull. It is. That's actually one of the things that we 
talked about in that higher level work. Some of it there's 
local partnerships that are critical to this as Postmaster 
General mentioned, but we are looking into where the postal 
police situation is when we do the local work.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you. Thanks, Mr. Chair.
    Chairman Peters. Thank you. Senator Carper, you are 
recognized for your questions.

              OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CARPER

    Senator Carper. Thank you Mr. Chair. Welcome. One and all 
thank you for your service to our country. Some of you, in a 
variety of ways. People say to me, why have I over the years 
been so interested in Postal Service and it actually goes back 
to the Vietnam War. A lot of folks in my generation were 
serving in Southeast Asia and then we would fly 12 hour 
missions off the coast of Vietnam. About once a week after we 
were flying, we would come back and have chow with our crew and 
call it a day and, but once a week, the mail came. It was the 
best day of the week.
    For other veterans who served in a war, and including that 
war, you know how important it was to stay in touch with your 
family and friends back home. The Postal Service did a great 
job. I want to make sure that the Postal Service has what it 
needs to continue to do a good job, not just for people in a 
war situation or dangerous situation around the world, but 
right here at home in all 50 States.
    I was proud of the work that this Committee did in the 
117th Congress--happy to be a part of that in order to enact 
the bipartisan Postal Service Reform Act, which a number of you 
provided input to. We appreciate that. But provided nearly $50 
billion with a B, $50 billion in financial relief for the 
Postal Service over about a decade. The law repealed a 
burdensome pre-funding mandate for postal workers retiree 
benefits. Something that I tried to do for years. Under the 
leadership of this guy right here, we got it done. That the 
idea of doing that is the right thing to do, but also to help 
put the Postal Service on a more solid financial foundation and 
ensure it can fulfill its vital role for generations to come.
    Starting this year, the Postal Service and the Office of 
Personnel Management are launching the new Postal Service 
Health Benefits Program for postal retirees and for their 
families, which will help people integrate their healthcare 
with Medicare. Something that needed to be done. It will be a 
significant feat for the Postal Service and for OPM to 
implement this new program.
    Mr. DeJoy, with the first open season beginning later this 
fall, can you please speak to how the Postal Service and OPM 
are beginning to prepare or are preparing for this transition? 
Does the Postal Service feel well equipped to offer enough 
customer support to employees and to retirees through this 
transition in partnership with OPM?
    Mr. DeJoy. Yes. I paid a visit over to the OPM director's 
office and met with the staff there maybe seven, eight months 
ago to have a kickoff discussion, and then brought the OPM team 
later to meet with our deputy Postmaster General, who's also 
our Chief Human Resources Officer. They have been working 
together on the details of this transition since that 
particular point in time. My updates are that everything is 
moving along well, some potential opportunities in the 
selection process that we afford the people that sign up for 
Medicare. But all of that from my readings and what I am being 
informed is moving nicely along and we will be ready to 
implement.
    Senator Carper. Alright. Thank you. I want to shift a 
little bit and talk a bit about shifting consumer preferences. 
Postal services, highest revenue generating mail class has been 
first class for as long as I can remember and we have seen, as, 
you know dramatic drops in volume over the years, in part 
because people will have like, credit cards in our wallets, and 
we use credit cards to buy stuff and actually pay our bills and 
so forth. But since 2006, First-Class Mail volume has dropped a 
little over 50 percent, 53 percent to be exact, reaching lowest 
volume, I think since 1968 when I first deployed to Southeast 
Asia all those years ago.
    It's evident that the Postal Service must adapt to shifting 
consumer preferences to ensure its financial sustainability and 
its ability to compete with the private sector. The Postal 
Service's always worked with the private sector companies in 
order to prepare mail and packages. While the Postal Service's 
historically excelled at last mile delivery, as you know, 
private sector competitors are continuing to expand, they are 
continuing to innovate, and in many ways have outperformed the 
Postal Service in getting mail and packages to customers 
efficiently and at lower costs.
    My question, Mr. Dejoy, is given this trend, could you 
elaborate for us on the Postal Service's strategy of 
diversifying revenue streams to better align with today's 
customer preferences? What initiatives or partnerships are 
being pursued to capitalize on opportunities to bring the 
Postal Service up to par with private sector competitors, and 
ultimately provide better service to your customers?
    Mr. Dejoy. Yes. I think that you are hitting on the key 
point. Mail volume dropped, prices got cut in half, prices did 
not rise. We had an ineffective network to continue to make the 
deliveries along the standards that we have.
    The Delivering for America Plan is trying to make that 
network resemble a FedEx or UPS type network, still reach its 
standards in five days and integrate the mail and package 
movement together to delivery.
    We had three different networks in the package, in our 
business. I am collapsing it to one. We had a competitive 
network that was running around our network, getting to our 
delivery units. We did not have products that properly matched 
with the consumer wanted and did not create either operational 
leverage or revenue leverage.
    We introduced a new product back in July, ground advantage, 
which enabled us to take packages that are over one pound in 
the same net in the same network as a first class network. We 
are seeing 450 percent growth in that volume. We did 133 
million packages last peak than we did the year before. There's 
other methodologies of integrating and preparing us to reach 
our last mile, the most magnificent part of the Postal Service, 
the last mile delivery route system. We are trying to 
effectively reach that with a streamlined, cost effective, 
product oriented service and affordable pricing.
    I think we are on our way to capitalize on that. That's 
going to be our growth of revenue. I have besides taking $5 
billion out of cost over the next two years, I have a $3 or $4 
billion revenue goal in the package business.
    Senator Carper. Alright. Thank you. Am I done? I think it's 
a wrap. Thank you very much.
    Chairman Peters. Senator Ossoff, I will recognize you for 
your questions and also I need to step out to vote real quick. 
I will hand the gavel to you till I return.

              OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR OSSOFF

    Senator Ossoff [presiding]. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. 
DeJoy, core job of the Postal Service is to deliver mail and 
packages on time, correct?
    Mr. DeJoy. Yes, sir.
    Senator Ossoff. Are mail and packages being delivered on 
time in Georgia today?
    Mr. DeJoy. No, sir.
    Senator Ossoff. Why not?
    Mr. DeJoy. We have had significant issues in terms of 
transitioning from 11 plants in the Atlanta area into three. We 
have taken on a big train. The Atlanta, Georgia area has been 
one of our worst served areas over the last 10 years. But 
mostly because we had 10, 12 different locations around the 
Atlanta area----
    Senator Ossoff. Mr. DeJoy, I do not want to talk about the 
last 10 years. I want to talk about the last three months.
    Do you know, since you made this shift to the new Palmetto 
facility what percent of outbound First-Class Mail was 
delivered on time in Atlanta?
    Mr. DeJoy. It's significantly lower in number.
    Senator Ossoff. Yes. 66 percent. Do you know what share of 
inbound First-Class Mail is delivered on time?
    Mr. DeJoy. It's probably all day late.
    Senator Ossoff. So take a guess, how much of it's on time?
    Mr. Dejoy. 35 percent.
    Senator Ossoff. You are pretty much there. Thirty-six 
percent. Thirty-six percent of the mail is being delivered on 
time to my constituents. What is the specific nature of the 
operational failure?
    Mr. DeJoy. The specific nature of the operate, we had to 
move 2000 people from all these different plants into one 
location. We had strict requirements as to when they move. It's 
a big facility that we opened up. We have inbound 
transportation issues.
    Senator Ossoff. Yes, but you knew it was going to be hard 
and complicated?
    Mr. DeJoy. Yes. We tried to phase it in over several 
months, which we did. We are going to fix it.
    Senator Ossoff. When is it going to be fixed?
    Mr. DeJoy. You should see it start now, and I think we will 
get to where we need to be in about 60 days.
    Senator Ossoff. Do you think that one of your private 
sector competitors would have rolled out?
    Mr. DeJoy. Yes. I think----
    Senator Ossoff. Hold on a second, Mr. DeJoy, a new system 
that would reduce on time delivery to 36 percent and then say 
it's going to take months to fix it? Months?
    Mr. DeJoy. Private businesses in taking on operations of 
this nature, with the resources that we have, do in fact have 
these types of problems.
    Senator Ossoff. You do not have months to fix 36 percent of 
the mail being delivered on time.
    I have constituents with prescriptions that are not being 
delivered. I have constituents who cannot pay their rent and 
their mortgages. I have businesses who are not able to ship 
products or receive supplies. I wrote you on March 14th. Did 
you get my letter?
    Mr. Dejoy. My office probably got it.
    Senator Ossoff. I did not write your office. I wrote you, 
did you receive my letter?
    Mr. DeJoy. I have not read your letter.
    Senator Ossoff. You have not read my letter.
    Mr. DeJoy. I tried to speak to you on Friday.
    Senator Ossoff. You have not read my letter?
    Mr. DeJoy. I have not.
    Senator Ossoff. The mail's not on time in Georgia. I am a 
Member of the Committee with of jurisdiction. You have not read 
my letter? That explains why I have not received a response to 
my letter. March 14th, I wrote you with two specific questions.
    What update can you provide regarding the aforementioned 
reported issues at the Atlanta Regional Processing and 
distribution center in Palmetto? Question one. Question two, 
how is USPS currently communicating with customers in the metro 
Atlanta area reporting delayed and lost packages? You have not 
read the letter?
    Mr. DeJoy. Letters come in, they put stuff together to 
answer it to get----
    Senator Ossoff. Let me just give you just a friendly piece 
of advice. You should personally read letters from Members of 
the U.S. Senate Committee that funds and oversees your 
operations, particularly where you are failing abysmally to 
fulfill your core mission in my State. Let me be clear, I think 
postal workers are out there every single day working their 
hearts out to deliver the mail on time.
    But if they do not have the infrastructure and the 
management competence overhead them, to make a transition like 
this without drastically impairing the core function of the 
Postal Service, everyone in my State is losing. The amount of 
distress this is causing my constituents is massive. I want to 
know what you are going to do, what specific steps you are 
going to take to fix this within two weeks.
    Mr. DeJoy. We have engaged over 50 different management 
executives onsite. We are finishing up our staffing at the 
remaining three locations. We are revamping our truck 
schedules. We are stabilizing the operation in terms of our 
machinery. That's what we have deployed there. We are working 
better on our--we have special teams down onsite--on working on 
our docks, and we are working the rest of the transportation 
aspects of this that have been causing a significant amount of 
problems.
    The two plants where we did a lot of transfers within the 
next 10 days, we should have them fully staffed. We had issues 
in terms of those transfers. The team is working very hard. I 
can assure you that in the long run that you will have probably 
the best service in the country.
    Senator Ossoff. We know the long run is too long. You have 
weeks, not months to fix this. If you do not fix it, 36 percent 
on time delivery, I do not think you are fit for this job. I 
yield to Senator Butler.

              OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR BUTLER

    Senator Butler. Thank you. I appreciate the advocacy on 
behalf of your Georgia constituents. Thank you all for being 
here and for your effort, Postmaster DeJoy. I heard you say 
something, I wrote it down during your exchange with Senator 
Lankford. I just want to give you the opportunity to help me 
understand what you meant. You said, coming up on an election, 
I expect it will slow down. What does that mean?
    Mr. DeJoy. All the activity that we have in terms of the 
transition activity.
    Senator Butler. I wanted to understand that because as a 
State having 40 million constituents that has moved to all mail 
ballot, is concerning to me. I really want to understand what 
your plan is, and I know California is not the only State where 
voters are expecting to get their ballot in the mail. My mother 
is actually a constituent of Senator Ossoff's and just this 
past election cycle did not get her mail-in ballot, actually on 
time, forcing her to go and have to stand in line for three 
hours to vote in person. I would like to understand your plan 
for what voters should expect from the Postal Service relative 
to this upcoming election season?
    Mr. DeJoy. The postal voters should expect the same good 
service that they have gotten in every election. Over 99 
percent of ballots get turned around within two or three days. 
We have issued reports every year. I have put together a 
specific infrastructure within the organization that works with 
all election boards throughout the year.
    We have deployed extraordinary measures during election 
time where we run extra trips, we put extra people onsite. We 
have special oversight areas, you know departments within each 
area of the election, as you should expect, the same good 
service we have been delivering for since I have been here.
    Senator Butler. Thank you for that. I just have to note, 
and I will continue with my line of question, but there is an 
acceptance of exclusion that continues to sort of show up in 
your testimony and your engagement. When you were speaking with 
Senator Rosen, there was an acceptance of 10 percent of 
Nevadans not getting their mail on time, and an acceptance of 
only 30 percent of Atlanta residents getting their mail on 
time.
    Now we are talking about an acceptance of two percent of 
our country's voters not getting their ballots on time. I just 
want to note a trend and move forward.
    I am going to raise two parts of California that probably 
have never been spoken in a Senate hearing. One is a town 
called Bridgeport, California in the county of Mono. Bridgeport 
is the only post office in this town. Since February 2023, the 
post office facility has been unusable.
    Now, I may not agree with a number of the political issues 
and positions that my colleague Congressman Kiley might put 
forward, but he and I are trying to engage and have been trying 
to engage your team to figure out how is it that for now on 
more than a year, there has been a facility that's been 
unusable by a water pipe burst that followed a disastrous 
snowstorm. It was not until Congressman Kiley was urging your 
office and reminding you that this facility was not in service 
that you were then sending out for trailers.
    Talk to me about how the voters in Bridgeport, California 
can expect the same good service that they have been getting 
from you when the same good service for a last year plus has 
been a non-functional facility that at this point is operating 
out of trailers?
    Mr. Dejoy. Yes. We have 31,000 centers around the country, 
and $25 billion worth of deferred maintenance. We have deployed 
one of the more expansive refurbishment investment strategies 
so that the Postal Service has seen in these----
    Senator Butler. I understand. You have put forth and I have 
listened to you talk about the incredible efforts that you have 
made to overcome challenging situations as you walked into your 
position and leadership of the Postal Service. A lot of it I 
truly believe is to be commended.
    I am trying to assess what kind of service I can talk with 
the folks in Bridgeport that they should expect, given that the 
facility that has been serving them is less than to be expected 
from a United States Postal Service facility for the last year. 
Here we are, as you noted, coming up on an election season in a 
State where the ballots are 100 percent by mail. Let me move 
from Bridgeport in Mono County to the great Californians down 
in Imperial.
    Imperial is one of our most southern counties in the State 
of California. In February 2022--maybe it's just a month of 
February in California--but in February 2022, a fire rendered 
again, the only post office in the town of Nyland, small 
majority low income community inoperable, after the fire, the 
Postal Service put out a notice to say that the post office 
will be closed temporarily, and that the office would reopen as 
soon as it was safe to do so. Mr. DeJoy, would you be surprised 
to know that two years later it's still not safe to do so?
    Mr. DeJoy. No.
    Senator Butler. Why is that acceptable?
    Mr. DeJoy. It's not acceptable. These are some of the 
initiatives that we are trying to roll out and fix. If my staff 
have wrote down, and I will look into what the strategies are 
for that location and get back with you.\1\ Again, it's, we 
have massive quantity of under poor conditions in many of the 
post offices around the country.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ The response to Senator Butler's question appears in the 
Appendix on page 182.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Senator Butler. I understand, but I am not going to assert 
what the condition of these facilities were prior to these 
incidents. You and your team know that better than I. But 
February 2023, there was a pipe that burst. We are in April 
2024, and it is not functioning to serve the people of Mono 
County.
    Mr. DeJoy. The post office closed?
    Senator Butler. The post office is running out of four 
trailers. February 2022, a fire happened. Again, I am not 
asserting that this is a part of deferred maintenance 
obligations. These are incidents that have happened, and, the 
residents of California are about to run into an election 
season where all of the ballots are delivered by mail, and they 
do not have any confidence that they are already not getting 
their prescriptions on time.
    Mr. Chair, I am running over and I want to be quick, but I 
do feel like again, I hear you about deferred maintenance. 
These are incidents that happen, and we are two and three years 
past those incidents, and nothing is being done that I can tell 
to ensure that the service is restored to the level of good 
that you said that folks should expect with this election 
season coming up.
    I appreciate, again, the effort that you are making, the 
work that you are implementing in your Delivering for America 
plan. But there are some Americans that are not getting it 
delivered, and I think we have to do better. Thank you, Mr. 
Chair.
    Senator Ossoff. Thank you. Senator Hawley.

              OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR HAWLEY

    Senator Hawley. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Mr. DeJoy, 
nice to see you. I want to talk to you about the post office 
facility in Baring, Missouri. Back in August of this last year, 
the post office there was closed after severe tornado damage. 
Missouri is right in the tornado alley. It has not reopened 
since then.
    September, I wrote to you asking about a timeline to have 
the post office reopened. Your office wrote back later that 
month and said, probably 90 days there would be a timeline 
announced. We did not hear anything. In January, I wrote again, 
actually Chair Peters, we wrote, asking about a timeline. I do 
not think I have gotten a response to that letter.
    Here's the Baring post office at the moment.\1\ It doesn't 
exist. This is a real community in my State. They do not have a 
post office at all. What bothers me is I have not heard 
anything about the timeline for getting it rebuilt. Can I just 
ask for an update on that?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ The picture submitted by Senator Hawley appears in the Appendix 
on page 176.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Mr. DeJoy. Yes.
    Senator Hawley. Do you have one?
    Mr. DeJoy. I do not have an update on the Baring.
    Senator Hawley. I am sorry.
    Mr. DeJoy. I do not have one, but I will get it to you.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ The response to Senator Hawley's question appears in the 
Appendix on page 183.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Senator Hawley. OK. Can we get one? I do not want to 
belabor the point here, but, because I think we have heard it 
now from multiple people, but in rural Missouri, this 
community, you see it, there's no post office here. They cannot 
get prescription drugs, they cannot get their bills on time, 
they are just stranded.
    I am frustrated here by the fact that it's been months and 
months, and I was told 90 days in September, and this is now 
the middle of April, and here we are. I would like to get your 
help on this for these good folks. Let me ask you then about 
some delivery issues in the Kansas City area. We have seen a 
tripling of casework reports in Kansas City, folks who are 
saying they are just not getting the mail when they are not 
getting on time. It was so significant.
    I asked the Inspector General to look into it and to 
recommend some action items to improve this. I just had 
constituents telling me that the end of March, they are finally 
getting their Christmas cards. I mean, this is not good. This 
is happening in Kansas City--it's also, frankly, happening in 
St. Louis on the other side of the State.
    Can you give me an update on the implementation of the 
Inspector General's recommendations for improving service in 
Kansas City? Maybe, you know something about the Kansas City 
situation and it would be helpful to hear?
    Mr. DeJoy. Right before peak season, we had a major 
transportation contractor go out of business. They had a big 
transfer hub in Kansas City. They actually had eight that we 
had about 5,000 truckloads of mail and packages going in and 
out of these places. We had to distribute that quickly, over 
several weeks, around 20 locations around the Nation. Reroute 
5,000 truckloads in and out of Kansas City, was not great on 
service to begin with. This just complicated the issue. I think 
you should see gradually improving service in the area.
    Senator Hawley. Good. I hope it will be more than gradual. 
I do not need to tell you this, but it's just incredibly 
frustrating for folks not to be able to get their mail and to 
have it go on for months and months. It's the Kansas City area. 
I am getting a lot of complaints out the St. Louis area. This 
got to be a priority.
    I want to ask you to be sure to tell all of the postal 
workers how grateful I am for them. I know that they are doing 
hard, hard work. I am proud of the work that they are doing, 
and we rely on them. My State, my gosh, we rely on them. We are 
a majority rural State. So, places like Baring, little town 
where I grew up, Lexington, other places. Boy, we are grateful 
for our postal workers and we are grateful for our post 
offices.
    I know it's something the Chair and I talk about a lot, and 
we do not want to see post offices closed in rural parts of 
this country. We want to see the mail delivered on time. Please 
thank them for me for all that they are doing. Thank you for 
your attention to these to these issues. I appreciate it. Thank 
you, Mr. Chair.
    Chairman Peters [presiding]. Thank you Senator Hawley. I am 
going to get back to the rural. We have heard a lot about rural 
places from my colleagues here. We are certainly seeing changes 
that are impacting us in Michigan, particularly in the Upper 
Peninsula (UP), which is about as rural as you can get. Folks 
up there, just like they do all over the country, rely on 
timely delivery for the mail.
    One particularly important thing that's occurring right now 
in the UP is testing drinking water for bacterial 
contamination. That requires one day delivery. When you take 
those samples and send it off to the lab, it has to get there 
in an incredibly timely way for it to be a valid test. That has 
become an issue for us in the upper peninsula.
    We also know as, all of you know, veterans need access to 
their medication. They get that primarily from mail service and 
that has to be a continued focus for the Postal Service to make 
sure that those meds are getting to our veterans on time. We 
had a hearing--or that the Postal Service had--because of some 
changes in the UP and actually postal officials were unaware 
that we had a Veterans Affairs (VA) facility in the Upper 
Peninsula, which was somewhat striking that they would not be 
aware of the VA facility that is incredibly important to 
veterans who live in the Upper Peninsula.
    Postmaster General DeJoy, I know that the Postal Service 
has not announced a number of changes to the transportation 
policy to several locations. But we found out recently it was 
being implemented in Michigan. My question for you is, why 
weren't communities notified before these changes were rolling 
out? Why isn't there more transparency so that they know what's 
happening?
    Mr. DeJoy. Yes. We make a lot of different transportation 
changes. I am trying to think about if you are talking about 
the one day issue or just a local transportation optimization.
    Chairman Peters. Local, part of the network changes.
    Mr. DeJoy. Yes, because it's not intended to have any 
difference in service standards. We run too many trucks with no 
mail in it, all over the country. The whole process is to try 
and optimize that so we can cut our costs. I have to get a 
billion and a half dollars out of local transportation.
    The intention of all these initiatives when these items are 
rolled out, are not to have a consequence. Within the 
standards. The standards are two to five days. We are 
delivering 60 percent of the mail and packages across the 
country a day in advance.
    We are trying to take advantage of that cushion that has 
been built in to make sure that we can optimize our freight. We 
did not change collection box times. We did not change 
anything. The mail sits in the system from the time we get it 
somewhere in the postal system across the country, whether that 
is the essence of the change. It was not expected to have an 
impact. I do not think in the upper peninsula we have had much 
of an impact on service. My last check was that for the most 
part, everything was running pretty smoothly.
    Chairman Peters. Yes. Obviously folks will bring issues up. 
We look at data. I look at data as well. One data point that I 
think is something we have to be really focused on, because 
there's a great deal of concern of people in the Upper 
Peninsula. Similar to what you heard from my colleague from 
Nevada is that the Postal Service, to my understanding, is 
considering a facility change that would mean local mail going 
to and from UP residents but going out of State into Wisconsin 
instead of the facility that you have in the Upper Peninsula. 
We think that's going to likely slow mail. But my question for 
you is, are you measuring the impact of these changes on rural 
service? So that we can roll it back if it's having that impact 
because of the folks?
    Mr. DeJoy. Senator, we all look at how the whole 
organization looks at service. I have instituted new quality 
programs across the organization and so forth. Our intentions 
are to make the service on all these moves. In fact, it is 
doable with the proper execution of the strategy.
    With regard to that particular move, as I said, it's not 
being dismissive of 10 percent of the people. The other 90 
percent has to get to a central point to be collated, to go 
across the country. I cannot collate these collations that are 
done at every one of these little locations to get 10 percent 
of the mail out to go back adds another step when we get to the 
location makes--reduces the density of trays increases the 
under utilization of our trucks.
    This mail should make it--wherever we send it to, I do not 
know exactly where this is going, but it's full intention to 
come in to schedule to do outgoing processing on it, postmark 
it, cancel it, and turn around the next morning, go back. We 
have a two-day standard to get back. All of this is planned out 
to work. There are lots of issues in execution that the team is 
learning how to make these types of changes. They have not been 
under the pressure to perform at a level that we need to, and 
using the new equipment and perform to a schedule and make 
these changes.
    But I am confident we will get there, and they will take a 
special eye on all these small moves, as they are not as 
consequential as some of the bigger things we did in Richmond 
and Atlanta. These are just taking the outgoing mail, routing 
the trucks to consolidate, routing to a different plant and 
putting it through the normal process. People are already in 
place, turning it around and sending it back down on their 
trucks. We think this is going to be you know, not 
consequential in the deployment.
    Chairman Peters. Well I hope so, I mean, what we are 
seeing, though, in Richmond and Atlanta for very obvious 
reasons is a red flag for us.
    Mr. DeJoy. Yes.
    Chairman Peters. Again, I am coming to you not as someone 
against change because you have to change and you have to 
become more efficient. But change also creates challenges as to 
actually the implementation. Mr. Kubayanda, you talked about 
the advisory opinions that the Commission has to just kind of 
take a little bit of a pause to take a look at and talk to 
stakeholders around, I think what are your concerns 
specifically--could the commission do one of these advisory 
opinions? What do you think we would learn from that?
    Mr. Kubayanda. Yes, Senator, I believe an advisory opinion 
is very valuable and is merited at this time as the Postal 
Service ramps up this rollout of DFA with the RPCs and also the 
optimized collection. I think combined, those are creating 
what's likely to be a nationwide impact on service. We do think 
an advisory opinion is appropriate. As I mentioned in previous 
advisory opinions in 2021 and 2022 the Commission identified a 
number of concerns as the Postal Service started to implement 
some changes.
    Those concerns included overly optimistic estimates about 
cost savings, lack of communication with stakeholders, 
potential impact on rural constituents, potential impact on 
veterans, and others receiving medications through the mail. 
All these have come to fruition that we have seen in the data. 
We have seen this in the constituent complaints.
    We have seen this in the Inspector General's recent 
reports. I think that advisory opinion process has a lot of 
value. We believe that the advisory opinion would be timely 
right now.
    Chairman Peters. Postmaster General DeJoy, when I in my 
original round of questions and raised the concerns, and you 
came back and said, no, we are willing to slow things down to 
make sure that it's all operating correctly. Because you are 
success focused. I have grown to know you over the months here. 
It seems as if an advisory opinion to kind of take a look at 
this while you are continuing to work. I am making sure that 
both Richmond and Atlanta are performing.
    That's going to be your end of the argument. That's a drop 
the mic moment. When Richmond and Atlanta are performing 
better, they are coming in below cost. Mail delivery services 
are still there. While you are doing that, also taking a 
broader look at the impact, would you be open to this advisory 
opinion? Is this something that would give you a fresh set of 
eyes?
    Mr. DeJoy. I want to discuss with counsel, but we are in 
the process of considering an advisory opinion with regard to 
things that we feel are magnanimous changes to the mail 
community and are working through what, in fact, we would ask 
an advisory opinion for. It's a broad thing to try and baseline 
what we are working through right now. Have been working 
through over the last six or eight weeks.
    Chairman Peter. I will give you time to answer that. But, 
so what kind of timeline do you think that'll--you've been 
doing it for six weeks now. When would that determination, what 
would the context?
    Mr. DeJoy. I would have to take it to the board. It could 
be this board meeting, or it could be a special board meeting 
afterwards is what we would----
    Chairman Peters. It would be great if it could be this 
upcoming one and show the----
    Mr. DeJoy. We are working on it. We have to figure out what 
exactly it is that we want. Because I do not want to do this 
again. I kind of have a good understanding of what the 
infrastructure looks like. I do not understand what issues are 
not making this connected. We still plan to deploy a very good 
service.
    Chairman Peters. Yes. You can finish.
    Mr. Dejoy. Opening up a facility within five miles of 10 
facilities. Putting the right equipment and tools and amenities 
in it. That's what we are doing across the country--there's 
nothing magnanimous about that. Our inability to execute comes 
from a long period of time of not executing change in a 
constructive manner. And the all, you know, those types of 
issues. How to load a truck, when to load a truck, trucks 
running late. All of that have been issues within the Postal 
Service that we have been working to change since we got here. 
We are making progress on that.
    It's important to recognize that the strategy is pretty 
straightforward. I am in fact investing in more facilities. I 
am opening old facilities that were closed to bring different 
services with the sorting and delivery centers closer to the 
communities. We are adding capacity. We are teaching our people 
and so forth. But the fact that we need to change, because we 
can do all these things--we could not--I could avoid those all 
these critiques, like everyone before me did. We will continue 
down the spiral to where everything is much worse and much 
broader than what it's today.
    That is nothing with regard to the plan. It has to do with 
our execution of it. We are working on that. That will you 
know, that will get better. But this is where we are on the 
360.
    Chairman Peters. Again, and I am all about data and I am 
all about how changes need to be made and execution has to be 
there. This is a really complex situation. I know you walked 
into this as well, but you are a data person as well as I have 
gotten to know you, that we want to look at the data. The data 
does not look great to Richmond. It looks really terrible in 
Atlanta.
    You can change that narrative pretty dramatically by 
showing those numbers are changing. I think you could agree 
that a lot of folks get nervous when you see those kinds of 
numbers. Why are we going to continue to roll this out? That's 
not saying it cannot work. It may very well work, but you just 
need to demonstrate that. When you demonstrate that people will 
get on board, and that will be a great thing.
    But we are just saying, let's step back a little bit. Keep 
working on Richmond and Atlanta. That's going to take time to 
get that implementation down. You are going to learn a whole 
lot of lessons. I am sure that happened and you were very 
successful in the private sector. You did that as well. You did 
not want to disrupt your customers. You would take time to be 
able to figure that out.
    Having an advisory opinion coming in as well. Taking it 
from a holistic standpoint. Just creates more transparency, 
which builds more trust because this is about trust. That's the 
biggest part of it. I look forward to seeing what you put 
forward on the advisory committee. I think that's very 
positive.
    Mr. DeJoy. But to be clear, we have been answering from the 
chairman, dozens and dozens of questions. Every week we get 
questions from the Postal Regulatory Commission about what it 
is we are doing, where every post office is in the country, and 
other types of things. We have been submitting information. The 
PRC as well, I have briefed the PRC quarterly, right? With 
regard to what we are doing. It's not that when, and I cannot 
think of how to be more transparent. I speak everywhere. We 
brief people. We speak to everybody you know, groups that we 
can before we do these things. But yes, we will keep you 
posted. I will let you know when we fact decide what we are 
going to do.
    Chairman Peters. I appreciate your desire to be 
transparent. I am going to make some requests here. In my 
letters to the Postal Service about your plans, I have asked 
for several specific sets of information. We have not received 
full answers.
    Specifically, I would like the Postal Service to provide 
the Committee. One, a list of locations, the Postal Service 
plans to change with specific timelines for implementation. 
Meaning when you actually intend to make those changes on the 
ground at these places. Two, full-service data on every 
location implemented so far. That means data for every type of 
facility before and after implementation. Three documentation 
for any cost projections, impact studies that the Postal 
Service has conducted. You know that's just data.
    You must be looking at this stuff obviously you are looking 
at too, I would assume in your due diligence. We would like to 
have that from the Committee as well. Would you commit to 
providing that information to the Committee by May 1st?
    Mr. DeJoy. Let me get back to the office, sir, and I will 
have Peter, get in touch with Annika, and we will give you a 
date on it.
    Chairman Peter. Is that something you think is doable?
    Mr. DeJoy. May 1st?
    Chairman Peters. May 1st. You should have this information, 
I suspect already.
    Mr. Dejoy. Yes. Let me just explain one thing about cost 
data, right. To drive costs out of the system, we need the 
system.
    Chairman Peters. You have projections, though. I do not 
disagree. You need a system, but when you make those changes, 
you are clearly projecting, just like in private industry, you 
are going to project profit, you are going to project costs.
    Mr. DeJoy. I sent you a letter telling you what I am trying 
to get, $5.5 billion out of the system.
    Chairman Peters. We would like to have those impact 
studies. We will work with your team to try to do that May 1st. 
That would be important. Obviously the other piece of all this, 
Chairman Martinez in your oversight function in the Board of 
Governors as well. I will just end with this kind of question 
and thought here. Election mail, obviously, is a very delicate 
operation for the Postal Service. You have heard some of my 
colleagues talk about it, and it requires a lot of 
coordination.
    My question for you, sir, is before you allow the Postal 
Service to move forward with some of these changes, are you 
willing to stop and consider or reconsider potential impacts on 
election mail, if you believe that that is a risk. Will you be 
very open and transparent about that process, to make sure that 
we can count on election mail, getting there in a timely way, 
which is essential for our democracy?
    Mr. Martinez. To our duty of care is basically to stay 
informed as we do as a board, and to provide oversight. We have 
been very strong on making sure that elections work very 
smoothly and on time. In August 2020, when there was a lot of 
criticism about whether that would happen in November 2020, the 
board established a special committee--an election mail 
committee that was at the time, headed by Governor Moak to make 
sure that everything would work and was coordinated with 
management to make it sure that the election worked smoothly. 
And it did.
    After I became chair, we made the special committee 
permanent, and now it's a standing committee of the board, and 
that's chaired by Governor McReynolds, who's an expert on 
election matters. She meets regularly with management. There's 
a special task force in management dedicated to election mail 
performance. We will be on top of this.
    We do not want to come back here in January, February--
although my term expires in December--and face you and say, 
Hey, it did not work. You can be assured that we are going to 
be on top of it. I cannot make assurances ahead of time of what 
we would do or not do, because it would be, frankly non 
prudent.
    Chairman Peters. Very good. I hope that's the case, and 
appreciate your focus on that. I do appreciate that. You know, 
I think I speak for everybody on the Committee, we want Postal 
Service to be successful. This is just absolutely critical for 
our country. It's why we really get support for the postal 
reform legislation that passed a while ago.
    Postmaster General DeJoy, you were very helpful in getting 
us to get that passed as well. I appreciate that. There's other 
things that we can do legislatively, and I am certainly open to 
those discussions particularly related to investments. Those 
are things that need to be looked at. I will say we tried to do 
some of those fixes before, and we ran into hurdles to do that. 
It's not an easy thing to do, but I do believe it's incredibly 
important that we do.
    I agree with that, but I am just laser focused as I know 
all of you are. It's about service. It's about making sure that 
the American people can count on it. You have a really hard 
job. You are delivering to every single address in America and 
providing that connectivity that was a vision of Benjamin 
Franklin. You are living on quite a legacy, the first 
Postmaster General, Benjamin Franklin. You are living on that 
legacy to be able to do that.
    We stand ready to help, but we just need more transparency. 
We need to know what's happening. We want some caution in not 
just believing that a plan works but also being able to back 
that up with data that shows that it's actually happening. If 
it's not happening as fast as we would like, we are OK with 
that as long as we are working to try to figure out how to fix 
it.
    But we should not necessarily be potentially reckless in 
moving forward with a big change before you have worked out 
some of the kinks. When I say kinks, you know, kinks are things 
like getting medicine on time. It's like getting your bacterial 
test on time to find out if your drinking water is--those are 
not just kinks. Those are significant concerns that people 
have. The American people have always relied on the U.S. Postal 
Service.
    I want to continue to rely on the U.S. Postal Service for 
another century or more. That's going to require all of us 
working together, kind of breaking down turf battles and 
fights, know that I am about just trying to solve this problem. 
I know all of you want to solve these problems. Let's do that 
together. It really starts with having transparency and having 
other stakeholders and voices being heard in this process as we 
move forward. Thank you for being here.
    Mr. DeJoy. If I may add something.
    Chairman Peters. Sure.
    Mr. Martinez. I can say that the board agrees 100 percent 
with the objectives that you have laid out, which are 
consistent with what the Postmaster General's objectives are. I 
would just point out to keep in mind, this huge restructuring 
is happening at the same time that we got to deliver service. 
It's not as if we are doing it from scratch.
    Chairman Peters. I get it.
    Mr. Martinez. OK. It's difficult stuff, and the statistic 
that always floors people is, we handled daily, almost 400 
million pieces of mail and packages. The scale of this 
organization is huge, and that's what we are trying to deal 
with and change and improve. Thank you.
    Chairman Peters. Yes, we are aware of that. Steering and 
changing course is not easy. I served in the U.S. Navy, it's a 
lot different steering a destroyer than an aircraft carrier. 
You have an aircraft carrier on steroids basically. Let's work 
together.
    But please Postmaster General DeJoy, please give us this 
information. It's really important to have that. Please, let's 
just look at data and understand data speaks loud and good data 
ends up building a lot of trust as well, which is what we need.
    With that, again, thank you for all of you being here 
today. The record for this hearing will remain open for 15 days 
until 5 p.m. on May 1, 2024, for the submission of statements 
and questions for the record. This hearing is now adjourned. 
[Whereupon, at 12:27 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
