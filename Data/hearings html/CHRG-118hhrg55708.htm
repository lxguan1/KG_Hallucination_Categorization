              U.S. House of Representatives

               Committee on Oversight and Accountability

 Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government 
                               Innovation

                                           Washington, D.C.

    The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 4:01 p.m., in 
room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Nancy Mace 
[Chairwoman of the Subcommittee] presiding.
    Present: Representatives Mace, Timmons, and Connolly.
    Also present: Representative Moylan.
    Ms. Mace. Good afternoon, you all. I am pleased to 
introduce our witnesses for today's hearing.
    Before we do that, I want to ask unanimous consent for 
Representative Moylan from Guam to be waived onto the 
Subcommittee for today's hearing for the purposes of asking 
questions. So, without objection, so ordered.
    Our first witness today is Mr. William Evanina, Chief 
Executive Officer of the Evanina Group and former Director of 
the National Counterintelligence and Security Center. Our 
second witness is Mr. Rob Joyce, owner of Joyce Cyber, LLC, and 
former Special Assistant to the President and White House 
Cybersecurity Coordinator.
    Our third witness is Mr. Charles Carmakal, Chief Technology 
Officer at Mandiant, and our fourth witness today is Mr. Steven 
Kelly, Chief Trust Officer at the Institute for Security and 
Technology.
    I would now like to recognize myself for 5 minutes for my 
opening statement.
    Earlier this year, top intelligence and cybersecurity 
officials testified before the Select Committee on China about 
a vast, long-term, and ongoing campaign by the Chinese 
Communist Party, or CCP, to hack into the computer systems that 
operate America's critical infrastructure--our dams, power 
plants, transportation hubs, and other essential operations. We 
do not know the full extent of this campaign. Why? First, the 
hacks are done in a manner designed to avoid detection. Second, 
the perpetrators are not trying to steal data or cause systems 
to immediately go haywire. It is worse. This campaign, labeled 
Volt Typhoon, has been underway for several years, at a 
minimum.
    The Chinese Government and its state-sponsored actors are 
using an infiltration tactic called Living Off the Land. The 
hackers' aim is to blend in with normal Windows system and 
network activities and remain undetected, according to one 
cybersecurity expert. Using malicious software, Volt Typhoon 
finds vulnerabilities to penetrate internet-connected systems 
to take control of devices like routers and security cameras, 
for example.
    The goal here is not smash-and-grab-type theft or immediate 
system disruption. It is a lot more disturbing because China is 
playing the long game. It is silently pre-positioning itself 
for disruptive or destructive cyberattacks against U.S. 
critical infrastructure in the event of a major crisis or 
conflict with the United States. That is according to an 
advisory jointly issued this year by the National Security 
Agency, the FBI, and other Federal agencies. In other words, 
the CCP is biding its time until it has reason to awaken these 
cyber sleeper cells. At the critical moment, they will trigger 
them to create confusion and disarray across America by 
disrupting our power supply, our transportation, our 
communication networks, our water and our food supply. This is 
a terrifying but realistic scenario. It also illustrates how 
China's cyber warfare against the United States has matured. It 
is now part and parcel of its military strategy and its plan to 
achieve its broader ambitions on the world stage.
    Earlier this year, General Paul Nakasone, former head of 
the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command, testified the People's Republic 
of China poses a challenge unlike any our Nation allies have 
faced before, competing fiercely in the information domain. 
Today's hearing is a forum to discuss the challenge posed by 
China's cyber warfare and how we must, as a Nation, meet that 
challenge.
    We know China is throwing massive money and manpower into 
its efforts. FBI Director Wray recently testified the PRC has a 
bigger hacking program than that of every major nation 
combined. In fact, if you took every single one of the FBI's 
cyber agents and intelligence analysts and focused them 
exclusively on the China threat, China's hackers would still 
outnumber FBI cyber personnel by at least 50 to 1. Fifty to 1, 
what a massive, massive number.
    This speaks to the necessity of the U.S. maintaining its 
technological edge over China, including in cutting-edge fields 
like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. AI is 
increasingly being harnessed as both an offensive and defensive 
tool in cyber warfare, and post-quantum cryptography will be 
key to safeguarding critical data in the future. We also need 
to bolster cybersecurity partnerships between the Federal 
Government, the private sector, and international allies. These 
are vital pathways for sharing threat information. Finally, we 
need to widen our talent pipeline to help fill the hundreds of 
thousands of cybersecurity job vacancies that currently exist 
in the public and private sector of the United States.
    To facilitate today's dialog, we are thrilled to have 
testifying today individuals who recently served at the highest 
levels of the Federal intelligence community. Before I--well, I 
already introduced them. I skipped the order, so you are here, 
so we will now recognize you for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Connolly. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. Forgive me for 
being a little late, but we have too many hearings. I have two 
markups, two hearings, two briefings, and two sets of votes 
today, so maybe we should cut back on some hearings.
    This past March, the Office of Director of National 
Intelligence released the Annual Threat Assessment of the U.S. 
Intelligence community. An excerpt from the report reads, 
``China remains the most active and persistent cyberthreat to 
U.S. Government, private sector, and critical infrastructure 
networks.'' The Chinese Communist Party poses a significant 
threat to the safety and economic prosperity of the United 
States. Through a multipronged strategy that includes the Belt 
and Road Initiative, economic coercion, and military buildup, 
the CCP has sought to challenge the American-led, rules-based 
international order. As part of its larger campaign to conduct 
asymmetric attacks on the United States, Beijing has turned to 
cyberattacks to steal American companies' intellectual 
property, undermine our civil society, and disrupt civilian and 
military infrastructure.
    Just 2 months ago, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency, or CISA, confirmed that CCP-sponsored groups, 
like Volt Typhoon, have successfully infiltrated the Federal 
Government's civilian and military systems. What is more, some 
of those groups have been on our networks for up to 5 years and 
lay in wait until the opportune moment to disrupt a military 
response or to disable our water and power infrastructure. 
Unfortunately, when it comes to cyber warfare, the threat 
extends beyond China. In fact, experts have identified that not 
just China, but also Iran and North Korea, are using Russia's 
well-known disinformation playbook to disrupt elections, 
infiltrate American companies, and generally cause malign 
behavior.
    Although disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks are not 
identical, they are two halves of the same chaotic coin. They 
similarly seek to inject uncertainty into daily operations and 
undermine the foundation of businesses, communities, and 
democratic values and tenets. Last November, Meta released its 
Third Quarter Adversarial Report, which outlined the removal of 
nearly 5,000 fake accounts all based in China. Meta removed 
those accounts for impersonating U.S. citizens and posting 
divisive rhetoric on deeply sensitive internal political issues 
with the intent to have an impact on the upcoming 2024 
Presidential election.
    It is not just America at risk. Earlier this year, the CCP 
again employed Moscow's tactics of online disinformation to 
cast doubt upon Taiwan's Government and to influence its recent 
elections. China has made a concerted effort to extend its 
power and influence across the world, especially in the global 
south. As roughly half of the world's population heads to the 
polls in 2024, China will take this opportunity, no question, 
to expand its influence and disrupt democratic processes using 
all tactics at hand.
    Fortunately, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken 
unprecedented steps to counter these threats, both direct 
cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns. The White House 
released the first-ever National Cybersecurity Strategy in 
October 2022, directing both public and private stakeholders to 
coordinate efforts to address new ambitious plans called the 
International Cyber Space and Digital Policy Strategy, seeking 
to work with allies to counter both Russia and China's global 
election interference efforts. I am also proud to have 
partnered with this Administration to safeguard networks 
against harmful nation-state actors.
    Historically, this Subcommittee has held hearings to 
conduct meaningful oversight of Federal IT programs and worked 
alongside the Government Accountability Office to produce a 
Biannual Scorecard on compliance with FITARA. Agencies then 
receive grades based on compliance with the law and other 
statutory-based IT priorities. The scorecard assesses 
compliance with the Federal Information Security Modernization 
Act--FISMA--evaluating all 24 CFO Act agency cybersecurity 
postures. For further transparency and after years of 
congressional advocacy for metrics to replace the expiring 
Trump-era cross-agency priority data, OMB finally began 
publishing quarterly Federal cybersecurity progress reports on 
performance on Performance.gov website. These reports measure 
agencies' progress in achieving milestones in implementing key 
cybersecurity measures articulated in President Biden's 
executive order on improving the Nation's cybersecurity. The 
executive order encouraged adoption of Zero Trust architecture, 
and I encourage the Administration to revolve the 
Performance.gov data and provide public metrics in order to 
assess agencies' implementation.
    To successfully stop our foreign adversaries, we need a 
whole-of-government approach with bipartisan congressional 
support to bolster our Federal work force and its IT 
infrastructure, and we need a whole-of-Nation approach to 
combat the disinformation and misinformation coming out of 
Russia and China. A report from the Center for Security and 
Emerging Technology found that, ``By 2025, Chinese universities 
will produce more than 77,000 STEM Ph.D. graduates per year,'' 
compared to approximately 40,000, almost half that, here in the 
United States. If international students are excluded from that 
number of the United States, Chinese STEM Ph.D. graduates would 
outnumber their U.S. counterparts by more than 3-to-1. Three-
to-one.
    For our country to compete effectively with China, we need 
to implement the Office of the National Cyber Director's 
National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategies' 
recommendations and bolster our cyber work force and cyber 
faculty pipelines. We will soon introduce legislation that 
would enhance the already highly successful CyberCorps Program, 
which boasts an impressive 97 percent successful job placement 
rate. When passed, I hope that legislation will extend the 
scholarship cap of this program from 3 to 5 years and provide a 
pathway for more STEM-trained Ph.Ds.
    We must properly fund the cyber defenses and basic 
government IT by reauthorizing and properly funding the TMF. In 
2021, Democrats fought to secure $1 billion investment for that 
program, although the President had requested $6 billion. 
Today, the TMF has funded 11 Zero Trust efforts, as well as 
numerous other cyber projects, to protect our military and 
sensitive information while retiring vulnerable legacy systems. 
Congress usually sees IT as an easy thing to cut, but in most 
cases, IT modernization is a critical investment with a 
critical return on it with respect to the future. The pandemic 
exposed the cracks in the Federal Government's aging IT 
infrastructure and how it impeded mission-driven programs. 
Upgrading those systems is not just a national security 
priority. It is essential to making sure government stays 
effective and serves the people.
    State-sponsored cybersecurity and disinformation campaigns 
seek to undermine the very fabric of our society. Cyberattacks 
wreak chaos and prove costly. Disinformation campaigns obscure 
the truth and threaten democratic principles. We must work to 
resist and oppose both. I look forward to the hearing, and I 
look forward to hearing from our witnesses. Thank you, Madam 
Chairman. I yield back.
    Ms. Mace. Pursuant to Committee Rule 9(g), the witnesses, 
if you will please stand and raise your right hands.
    Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony that you 
are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
but the truth, so help you God?
    [A chorus of ayes.]
    Ms. Mace. Let the record show the witnesses all answered in 
the affirmative. We appreciate all of you being here today and 
look forward to your testimony.
    Let me remind the witnesses that we have read your written 
statements, and they will appear in full in the hearing record. 
Please limit your oral arguments to 5 minutes, and as a 
reminder, please press the button on the microphone in front of 
you so that it is on and we can hear you up here. And when you 
begin to speak, the light in front of you will turn green. 
After 4 minutes, the light turns yellow, and then when the red 
light comes on, your 5 minutes has expired, and I will very 
kindly smile and wave this thing and ask you to wrap it up.
    So, you all can be seated, and I will recognize Mr. Evanina 
to please begin your opening statement, 5 minutes.

                      STATEMENT OF WILLIAM EVANINA

            CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE EVANINA GROUP, LLC

             FORMER DIRECTOR, NATIONAL COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

                          AND SECURITY CENTER

    Mr. Evanina. Chairwoman Mace, Ranking Member Connolly, 
Members of the Committee, it is an honor to appear before you 
today with my esteemed colleagues at the table.
    Our Nation faces an array of diverse, complex, 
sophisticated, and unprecedented threats by nation-state 
actors, cyber criminals, and terrorist organizations. Each of 
them in their own distinct manner pose a serious threat to our 
Nation, our systems, and our citizens. However and 
unequivocally, the existential threat to our Nation emanates 
from the Communist Party of China. This comprehensive threat is 
the most complex, pernicious, strategic, and aggressive threat 
our Nation has ever faced. It is an existential threat to every 
fabric of our great Nation, our capitalism, and our democracy.
    Xi Jinping drives a comprehensive and whole-of-country 
approach to the CCP's efforts to invest, leverage, infiltrate, 
influence, and steal from every corner of the United States. 
Naivete by those who hope to otherwise believe the opposite 
will only accelerate Xi's intentions and progress. 
Additionally, the United States' private sector, critical 
infrastructure, academia, and research and development entities 
have all become the new battle space for the CCP's nefarious 
activities. As this Committee is aware, it is currently 
estimated that the economic loss from the theft of intellectual 
property from the Communist Party of China is nearing $600 
billion per year. To make it more relevant and personal, that 
equates to approximately $6,000 per American families of four 
after taxes.
    China's ability to strategically obtain our intellectual 
property and trade secrets via legal, illegal, and 
sophisticated cyber and hybrid methods is like nothing we have 
ever witnessed before. It is said by many to be the largest 
theft of intellectual property in the history of the world. 
Technology, from ideation to manufacturing, is frequently the 
intended target of these efforts. Additionally, it is estimated 
that 80 percent of American adults have had all of their data 
stolen by the Communist Party of China. The other 20 percent, 
just most of their data. Data and technology have become two of 
the most valuable commodities in the world, and acquiring them 
has been a high priority for the CCP.
    I believe we must approach this existential threat with the 
same sense of urgency, leadership, spending, and strategy as we 
have done for the past 2 decades in successfully preventing and 
deterring terrorism. I would offer to this Committee that we 
are in a terrorism event--a slow, methodical, strategic, 
persistent, and enduring event--which requires a degree of 
urgency of government action and corporate awareness. It is 
clear that under Xi Jinping, the CCP's economic war with the 
United States, combined with his intent to be the military 
leader of the world, has manifested itself into a terrorism-
like framework.
    Let me be more specific. The CCP's capabilities and intent 
are second to none as an adversary. Countless cyber breaches, 
insider threats, and nefarious penetrations into our critical 
infrastructure are ubiquitous and have been widely reported. 
Add in the CCP's crippling stranglehold to so many critical 
aspects of our supply chain, and what results is domestic 
vulnerability we have not seen in generations, if ever. Now we 
must confront and defend against these CCP efforts with all the 
known and unknown artificial intelligence accelerators which 
will come along.
    As we continue to drive forward with AI development for the 
good, we must also ensure security safeguards are implemented 
to protect from the bad. For all the progress we make, we must 
equally think of the potential of a zero day exploit utilizing 
sophisticated AI. When we incorporate China's recent actions, 
to include, as referenced by the Chairwoman and Ranking Member, 
Volt Typhoon; sophisticated surveillance balloons across our 
sovereign land; technical surveillance stations just 90 miles 
away in Cuba; maritime port threats; Huawei; strategic land 
purchases near military installations; fentanyl; TikTok; malign 
influence, et cetera, the collage begins to paint a bleak 
picture that is beyond blinking red. I am not even addressing 
space, deep fakes, or 5G genomics.
    The inability or unwillingness to look behind China, the 
curtain they provide, and deal with the existential threat is 
no longer an option for the Congress, for the Administration, 
academic institutions, and the private sector. There is no more 
curtain to look behind. It has been removed. There must be 
consequences leveled for China's actions. Otherwise, there will 
be continued to be no deterrent. Volt Typhoon should be the 
straw of the proverbial camel's back. Unfortunately, I believe 
more is to come.
    Thank you for the opportunity to join my esteemed fellow 
witnesses, and I look forward to answering your questions.
    Ms. Mace. Thank you. I will now recognize Mr. Joyce for 5 
minutes.

                         STATEMENT OF ROB JOYCE

                         OWNER, JOYCE CYBER LLC

               FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT

               AND WHITE HOUSE CYBERSECURITY COORDINATOR

    Mr. Joyce. Chairwoman Mace, Ranking Member Connolly, 
Members of the Subcommittee, it is an honor to appear before 
you today. Thank you for this chance to discuss what I believe 
is the most significant cybersecurity issue faced by the U.S. 
That is the threat from cyberattack from the People's Republic 
of China and the threat it poses to our critical 
infrastructure. I am Rob Joyce. I served over 34 years at the 
National Security Agency, retiring as the Director of 
Cybersecurity, and I hope in our conversation today, I get to 
provide you some insight into the sophistication and strategic 
implications of these PRC cyberthreats and, really, how the PRC 
competes fiercely in the cyber domain.
    It has been widely understood that for years, PRC hackers 
have stolen intellectual property, they have performed 
traditional espionage through cyber, but now they are preparing 
attacks against our critical infrastructure through cyberspace. 
So that first segment, they stole intellectual property. This 
is to aid their domestic industry. Chinese state-sponsored 
hacking groups, like APT 41, have systematically conducted 
cyberespionage campaigns to steal trillions of dollars' worth 
of intellectual property and trade secrets from U.S. companies. 
It has been across critical sectors like aerospace, 
pharmaceuticals, energy, manufacturing, and more.
    For example, a multiyear campaign uncovered in 2022 showed 
APT 41 had infiltrated over 30 multinational firms and 
exfiltrated hundreds of gigabytes of proprietary data, 
including designs for fighter jets, missiles, drugs, solar 
panels, and other cutting-edge technologies not yet patented. 
The brazen thefts rob American companies of their R&D 
investment and competitive advantages, undermining U.S. 
economic interests. The annual cost to the U.S. economy from IP 
theft is hundreds of billions of dollars, and that does not 
include the long-term impact where China closes technology gaps 
and brings competing products to markets using stolen 
information.
    And the second area I would highlight is the hacking for 
traditional espionage. A good example of that cyberespionage is 
the intrusion last year into the U.S. State Department in which 
the U.S. State Department discovered the compromise of its 
email system. The attackers accessed the inboxes of the U.S. 
Secretary of Commerce, the U.S. Ambassador to China, 
Congressman Don Bacon, and key State Department employees. All 
of this was before a sensitive visit by the Secretary of State 
to China. Microsoft assesses the intrusion was a Chinese threat 
actor they call Storm 0558. According to the Cyber Safety 
Review Board study of this event, of which I was a panel 
member, the activity was so stealthy, Microsoft still cannot 
say with certainty how the credentials used in the attack were 
stolen from them.
    The issues of espionage and intellectual property theft 
have persisted for years, but now I want to highlight an even 
more troubling set of intrusions into critical infrastructure. 
In 2023, the U.S. cybersecurity community developed increased 
understanding that a set of PRC hackers, called Volt Typhoon, 
was pre-positioning on U.S. critical infrastructure. They were 
not there to steal our information but, instead, prepared to 
disrupt vital critical infrastructure systems. They want to 
slow the U.S. military's ability to mobilize and deploy in time 
of crisis, and they want to sow societal panic at the time of 
their choosing. They hope we would turn inward and focus on 
serious critical infrastructure problems at home rather than 
supporting any crisis on the other side of the globe. My 
colleague, the Honorable Evanina, talked about a simple 
description for their intent: domestic terrorism. They want to 
inspire panic inside our society. That is serious and 
disturbing.
    So, this activity was discovered and validated through 
unique collaboration of government and industry, and I sit here 
today with some of my industry partners. Foreign intelligence 
was used in conjunction with the tremendous insight of industry 
where NSA, along with multiple government agencies, both 
domestic and international, described the intrusions in a 
public advisory, and 11 of the biggest internet and 
telecommunication companies added their names to the 
publication as participating in the investigation. Subsequent 
work by FBI, CISA, and industry confirmed the compromise of IT 
systems in diverse infrastructure sectors, including 
communications, energy, transportation, water, and wastewater 
systems. They found prepositioning in the continental U.S. as 
well as the U.S. territory of Guam. Guam is significant because 
the island hosts the Anderson Air Force base and Naval Base 
Guam, which play a crucial role in any potential conflict with 
China over Taiwan.
    The intrusions have gone on for quite some time but have 
generally escaped notice. It is increasingly important that we 
understand the siege, that we work against it, and that we get 
our systems prepared to not only get them out but keep them 
out. These activities by the Chinese Government warrant your 
full attention and support, ensuring the PRC cannot undermine 
our national security. And I look forward to answering your 
questions alongside this knowledgeable panel.
    Ms. Mace. Thank you, and, Mr. Carmakal, you are recognized 
for 5 minutes.

                     STATEMENT OF CHARLES CARMAKAL

                        CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER

                                MANDIANT

    Mr. Carmakal. Chairwoman Mace, Ranking Member Connolly, and 
Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to 
share my observations and experiences regarding this very 
important topic, as well as for your leadership on 
cybersecurity issues. My name is Charles Carmakal, and I am the 
Chief Technology Officer at Mandiant
    In my role at Mandiant, I oversee a team of security 
consultants and incident responders that help organizations 
both respond to security events and prepare for and mitigate 
the risk and impact of those security events. I led the teams 
that are responsible for discovering and identifying the 
SolarWinds software supply chain attack in December 2020, the 
Colonial pipeline cyber destructive attack in 2021, and the 
discovery of several novel and sophisticated cyber campaigns 
carried out by China-nexus threat actors. I am here to talk 
about Mandiant and my personal experiences in defending against 
and responding to cyberthreats emanating from the People's 
Republic of China. I will share my firsthand observations and 
the observations of the team that I lead.
    Before we discuss today's threats, it is important to 
review what has happened over the past decade. On September 25, 
2015, the United States and China agreed that neither 
government would conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled 
theft of intellectual property for economic advantage. The 
following year, in 2016, Mandiant analyzed our incident 
response cases to assess the impact of the agreement. We 
actually observed a reduction in cyber intrusions by China-
nexus threat actors that began a year prior to the agreement. 
The relatively lower volume of intrusion activity continued 
until approximately 2020. Government-backed China-nexus threat 
actors operated notably differently prior to the agreement than 
they do in modern days.
    In my written testimony I talk about specific ways in which 
China-nexus threat actors operated prior to the agreement. 
These actors operate very differently today. They are more 
coordinated, resourced, sophisticated, and clandestine. I want 
to talk about a few of the capabilities that we see them 
demonstrating as they effectively break into organizations 
across the globe but, specifically, in the United States.
    We see them leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities, which 
essentially are vulnerabilities that are known by threat actors 
and exploited by threat actors before the vulnerability is 
known by the vendor. The tools and the know-how to exploit 
these vulnerabilities are shared amongst multiple discrete 
groups that conduct cyber operations for the benefit of the 
PRC. Over the past few years, we have observed targeted zero-
day exploitation of vulnerabilities in VPN, firewall, email 
security gateway, hypervisors, and other technologies that do 
not commonly support endpoint detection and response solutions. 
Endpoint detection and response solutions have gotten more 
effective over the years and have enabled organizations to 
detect compromises in Windows environments. Therefore, we see 
China-nexus threat actors targeting those systems that do not 
traditionally support EDR solutions, which essentially makes it 
more difficult for organizations to detect compromises.
    To further exacerbate the problem, we see threat actors 
leveraging vulnerabilities in closed-box appliances, which are 
essentially systems that provide routing functionality, 
firewall functionality, or other security functionality to 
organizations. Because these appliances are closed box, it 
makes it very difficult for organizations to actually determine 
if they are compromised. If an organization wants to 
forensically examine a compromised device, they often need to 
reach out to the vendor in order to be able to analyze it. Not 
all vendors will actually give permission to the victim 
organization to analyze the device.
    We also see China-nexus threat actors leveraging 
residential IP addresses to conduct their intrusion operations. 
Over the years, they have built a very large botnet or series 
of computers that essentially enable them to access victim 
environments such that they look like an employee of the 
organization by accessing the network in a close proximity to 
the employees or to the companies that they want to log into. 
So, for example, if they were targeting a company in Virginia 
and they wanted to emulate an employee that lived in Virginia, 
we would see them leveraging compromised home infrastructure 
that allows them to log into the VPN of that Virginia-based 
organization and look like an employee there. We also see them 
living off the land, which is essentially leveraging tools and 
technologies that are native to operating systems so that they 
can move laterally within environments and not get detected by 
the organizations.
    Given the advanced tradecraft leveraged by China-nexus 
threat actors, it is incredibly difficult for organizations to 
tell when they have been compromised. In fact, when we work 
with organizations and discover compromises, we often see that 
those compromises very often have lasted for weeks, months, and 
sometimes years. Over the years, I have personally observed 
multiple China-nexus threat actors with significant access and 
privileges to U.S.-based technology, defense, government, 
energy, construction, chemical, financial services, and 
healthcare organizations. Fortunately, I have not yet 
personally observed any actions taken by these actors that I 
consider to be overtly and intentionally destructive that could 
directly lead to negative kinetic outcomes or physically harm 
people. That could certainly change over time, but I wanted to 
share my personal experiences.
    On behalf of Mandiant, I thank you for this opportunity to 
testify before the Subcommittee.
    Ms. Mace. Thank you, and, Mr. Kelly, you are now recognized 
for your 5 minutes.

                      STATEMENT OF STEVEN M. KELLY

                          CHIEF TRUST OFFICER

                 INSTITUTE FOR SECURITY AND TECHNOLOGY

    Mr. Kelly. Chairman Mace, Ranking Member Connolly, and 
Members of the Subcommittee, my name is Steve Kelly. I am the 
Chief Trust Officer at the Institute for Security and 
Technology, a think tank that unites technology and policy 
leaders to create actionable solutions to emerging security 
threats. I came to IST almost a year ago after retiring from 
the FBI as a special agent working cyber issues, and during my 
tenure, I was honored to twice serve on the NSC staff. Bonnie 
and I have since moved back to Indiana, but I am glad to be 
here in the Nation's Capital to discuss this pressing topic 
with you.
    I am gravely concerned by both the PRC's illiberal global 
agenda and the means by which it seeks to realize it. For at 
least 2 decades, the PRC has carried out a rob, replicate, and 
replace strategy, which allows Chinese firms to benefit from 
stolen American innovation, begin manufacturing identical 
products at a lower cost, and put the victimized firm out of 
business. Over time and across numerous research and 
development areas, this strategy, enabled by large-scale 
economic espionage, has allowed the PRC's technology industry 
to rapidly catch up and, in some cases, surpass the United 
States and allied nations.
    Chinese technology products, both inside the PRC and for 
export, prioritize state-level interests over users' security 
and privacy, exposing users to government surveillance, acting 
as a vector for cyber operations, and potentially enabling 
denial and disruption operations. This has been a challenge 
here at home, leading Congress to fund ripping and replacing 
Huawei and CTE equipment from U.S. telecom networks, but the 
challenge is even greater in developing nations that often find 
the immediate need of economic development more pressing than 
the potential foreign intelligence risk. I am encouraged by a 
recent surge of interest in trusted technology within the 
investor community. For example, a group of leading investors 
recently announced their voluntary trusted capital investment 
principles and commitments. Another leading venture capital 
firm announced its American dynamism effort, and an array of 
investors and founders are driving a new defense tech-focused 
movement.
    While it has been a long time coming, many throughout the 
world have come to recognize the risks that often accompany 
lower-cost Chinese products and are seeking more trustworthy 
sources even at a price premium. I played a small part in 
planning and launching the U.S. Cyber Trust Mark, a voluntary 
security labeling program for consumer internet of things 
devices, like smart home appliances, and I am pleased by the 
enthusiasm shown by consumer technology manufacturers in this 
program. While the FCC is moving the program forward, I 
encourage Congress to ensure the program's future stability by 
specifically authorizing and funding it.
    The threat described by my fellow witnesses should inspire 
a new sense of urgency to remove the PRC's leverage by 
consistently counteracting and publicly exposing their cyber 
operations and hardening U.S. critical infrastructure. Given 
numerous cyberattacks impacting critical infrastructure over 
the past several years, including the ransomware attacks on 
Colonial Pipeline, JBS Foods, and many hospitals, we are 
clearly not doing enough. While ransomware is not the focus of 
this hearing, it is instructive of the real-world impact cyber 
operations can deliver. If Russian criminal gangs can achieve 
these effects, the People's Liberation Army most certainly can, 
too.
    President Biden's National Cybersecurity Strategy calls for 
establishing minimum cybersecurity requirements for critical 
infrastructure through regulation or, where such authority does 
not exist, to seek it. While Federal regulations are not 
appropriate or desired in all circumstances, I believe that 
safeguarding functions essential to national security, economic 
security, or public health and safety warrants a regulatory 
approach. If establishing baseline requirements is to be 
achieved, Congress will need to create or clarify regulatory 
authorities for certain sectors, and each sector risk 
management agency and regulator must be resourced to carry out 
the task.
    The infrastructure in need of protection is scattered 
throughout the Nation, and it is difficult to meet their needs 
from Washington, DC. Fortunately, there are a variety of 
players across the Federal enterprise who are able to engage at 
the local level. CISA's Cybersecurity Advisor Program, which 
places personnel across the country, is still quite new, and 
often an entire region may have only one such advisor. While I 
encourage Congress to fund sufficient advisors to cover the 
ground, what remains clear is the need for expanded and 
enhanced partnerships as force enablers. Fortunately, CISA 
cyber advisors are not alone as the FBI and Secret Service have 
task forces across the country.
    Emulating the successful Joint Terrorism Task Force 
Program, there exist incredible opportunity to team Federal, 
state, and local cyber personnel to undertake both proactive 
and reactive cybersecurity efforts. National Guard units acting 
under their state authorities might also plug into this model. 
And, given the topic of this hearing, I think it is worth 
considering what authorities might exist or be needed for 
active duty cyber personnel under Title IX to provide 
assistance or even protection to civilian entities essential to 
the operation of key military installations, also referred to 
as defense critical infrastructure. While this approach may not 
scale, I believe there are scenarios under which that would 
make sense and should be explored.
    I want to thank the Subcommittee for inviting me to 
participate in today's hearing and look forward to your 
questions.
    Ms. Mace. Thank you. I will now recognize myself for 5 
minutes of questioning. I do have several questions, so if I 
could just ask if we could be brief and direct and 
straightforward in our responses because I would like to try to 
get through all of them today.
    General Nakasone has stated that, ``If a nation-state 
decided to attack our critical infrastructure, I would say that 
is above the threshold level of war,'' and in the testimoneys 
that were prepared, it refers to China's cyber warfare against 
the U.S. as a form of terrorism, and, Mr. Evanina, you said 
today it was an existential threat, in your words. So, in the 
face of this terrorism, Mr. Evanina notes there is little 
deterrence also. So, my first question to you, Mr. Evanina, if 
these CCP-driven hacking campaigns are a form of war or 
terrorism, are we deterring China from conducting them?
    Mr. Evanina. Thanks for the question, Chairwoman Mace. If 
we are deterring, I am not aware of that from an intel 
perspective and a law enforcement perspective and a cyber 
perspective. What they are doing to us is on the border of----
    Ms. Mace. Why not? Why aren't we deterring?
    Mr. Evanina. You would have to ask the policymakers in that 
space, but I do believe as they are preparing for battle, as we 
heard, and our critical infrastructure, I do not think it is 
reasonable for the minimum standards to ask companies to defend 
against nation-state threat actors and their proxies. I think 
it is a big task for them to do, and I think U.S. Government 
should take more of a hand in defeating and deterring the 
Chinese Communist Party and their infrastructure.
    Ms. Mace. Is it safe to say this Administration does not 
have a strategy for deterrence?
    Mr. Evanina. I am not aware what the current strategy is.
    Ms. Mace. OK. OK. So, my next questions will be for Mr. 
Evanina and Mr. Joyce. Do we know how many of America's 
critical computer systems have been infiltrated via the Volt 
Typhoon hacking campaign? Do we know?
    Mr. Evanina. I am not aware.
    Ms. Mace. Mr. Joyce?
    Mr. Joyce. I do not have that information, no.
    Ms. Mace. OK. So, if it is achieving its goal of gaining 
undetected system access, how would we know?
    Mr. Joyce. So, Madam Chairwoman, I believe the combination 
of intelligence that revealed this campaign as well as the 
capabilities of the U.S. cybersecurity industry has the ability 
to find and defeat some of these activities. But it is going to 
take a combination of both the public efforts, the private 
efforts, as well as the targeted entities have to remove some 
of their outdated and legacy IT to be safe
    Ms. Mace. A debate that has been going on for the better 
part of 30 years probably. Mr. Joyce, do we know how much money 
the CCP invests in cyber warfare?
    Mr. Joyce. I do not.
    Ms. Mace. Mr. Evanina, do you know?
    Mr. Evanina. I do not.
    Ms. Mace. Do we know what kind of manpower they throw into 
these efforts? We heard what FBI Director Wray said recently, 
50 to 1 in terms of comparing it to FBI analysts, but do we 
know what kind of manpower they have?
    Mr. Evanina. I think that is a conservative estimate by 
Director Wray, but I also would include in that the 
cybercriminal actors and their proxies that are supported by 
the MSS and the PLA should be included in that number as well.
    Ms. Mace. OK. AI and quantum computing are powerful new 
tools in the arsenal of both hackers and defenders in 
cyberspace. How much does defense of critical U.S. computer 
systems hinge on our ability to maintain and buildupon our edge 
in AI over China? Either of you.
    Mr. Joyce. So, I believe that AI is actually going to 
advantage the defense much more than the offense, especially in 
the near term. The ability to look at large scales of data to 
understand the trade craft that might go undetected by human 
analysts is rapidly increasing by some of the innovations. So, 
I do believe that is our advantage today.
    Ms. Mace. Mr. Carmakal, I have a minute left. Your 
testimony states that Mandiant, you helped identify SolarWinds 
and the Colonial Pipeline disruption in 2021. Would you say 
China's Volt Typhoon campaign is designed to make even these 
major hacks pale in comparison?
    Mr. Carmakal. So far, we have only seen intrusion 
operations that were very hard to detect that were orchestrated 
by Volt Typhoon, plus many other threat actors emanating from 
China. We do not yet know what they might do, but we could tell 
you the capability and the access that they have is very 
significant, and they could certainly do anything similar to 
what happened to Colonial Pipeline or even much worse with the 
access that we know that they have.
    Ms. Mace. And how could we respond to a slew of disruptions 
to critical operators if all this is happening all at once, if 
they did something all at once?
    Mr. Carmakal. It would be very difficult to respond to. 
There is a finite amount of security talent and investigators 
and incident responders that could help respond to security 
events. And so if there were a cascading set of security 
attacks against organizations, it would be incredibly difficult 
to respond to it.
    Ms. Mace. All right. Thank you, and I will now yield.
    Mr. Connolly. Madam Chair, if you want to take another 5 
minutes?
    Ms. Mace. No, I will wait.
    Mr. Connolly. OK.
    Ms. Mace. Yes.
    Mr. Connolly. All right.
    Ms. Mace. OK. And I will now yield to Mr. Connolly for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Connolly. Thank you. Mr. Evanina, you were ringing the 
alarm bell some time ago. You served in the Trump 
Administration. What was your position?
    Mr. Evanina. Yes. I started as the head of 
counterintelligence for the United States in 2014 under 
President Obama, and I stayed there until January 2021.
    Mr. Connolly. OK. And you, among other things, led efforts 
to protect security and integrity of the 2020 election from 
foreign threats. Is that correct?
    Mr. Evanina. That is correct, sir.
    Mr. Connolly. Last month, the New York Times published an 
article, ``China's Advancing Efforts to Influence the U.S. 
Election Raise Alarms,'' and it highlighted that during the 
2022 midterm elections, the cybersecurity firm, Mandiant, 
reported that an influence campaign linked to China tried to 
discourage Americans from voting while highlighting political 
polarization. The finding illustrates how China has been using 
Russia's disinformation to ``influence American politics with 
more of a willingness to target specific candidates and 
parties, including now-President Biden.'' I ask that we insert 
this article into the record.
    Ms. Mace. Without objection.
    Mr. Connolly. I thank the Chair.
    Mr. Connolly. Mr. Evanina, during the Trump Administration, 
is it true you were already ringing the alarm that both CCP and 
Russia were trying to influence that 2020 election?
    Mr. Evanina. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Connolly. And in August of that year, you issued an 
official press release warning, ``We assess that Russia is 
using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice 
President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russian 
establishment.'' Your statement added, ``For example, pro-
Russian Ukrainian parliamentarian, Andrei Derkach, is spreading 
claims about corruption, including through publicizing leaked 
phone calls, to undermine President Biden and his candidacy and 
the Democratic Party.'' I ask unanimous consent to insert that 
press release into the record.
    Ms. Mace. Without objection.
    Mr. Connolly. Mr. Evanina, is that the same Andre Derkach 
who, according to reports, ``gained access to Trump's inner 
circle through Rudy Giuliani, the President's personal 
lawyer?''
    Mr. Evanina. Yes, sir.
    [Chart]
    Mr. Connolly. Is that the gentleman in question?
    Mr. Evanina. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Connolly. And is he sitting with Rudy Giuliani?
    Mr. Evanina. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Connolly. Aha. In fact, just a month after you issued 
your statement, the Trump Administration sanctioned him, to 
their credit, for being an ``active Russian agent for over a 
decade.'' Is that correct?
    Mr. Evanina. I believe that is correct.
    Mr. Connolly. Even though experts, including you and 
others, have repeatedly warned us about Russian efforts to 
smear Joe Biden with false information about corruption in 
Ukraine. And by the way, one of those informants who was the 
key witness of the oversight impeachment hearing is now in jail 
for lying to the FBI. Is that correct, Mr. Kelly? Are you 
familiar with that?
    Mr. Kelly. I do not have firsthand knowledge of that.
    Mr. Connolly. Well, do you have any thoughts, given your 
new role and your previous role, about the dangers that can 
ensue? Mr. Evanina warned us, correctly, about Russian 
disinformation inserting itself into our politics? And it sure 
did get into a very high level both here in Congress and in 
targeting the President of the United States with absolutely 
false information. What could go wrong with that, Mr. Kelly? 
What should we worry about with that?
    Mr. Kelly. Malign foreign influence operations coming from 
Russia, China, or anywhere else is incredibly problematic and, 
in particular, in the context of elections, so, I agree with 
that statement.
    Mr. Connolly. So, in some cases, credulous people might 
take at face value information coming from social media bots, 
false sources who create false identities as Americans when 
they are, in fact, not. In fact, recently, one of the big media 
companies just took down 5,000 accounts, I think I mentioned in 
my opening statement, all from China, pretending to be 
Americans. But the other is that political figures might use 
that information, knowing or not knowing it is false, for 
political gain that could, in fact, be harmful to our system, 
especially given the fact it is based on false information and 
a foreign actor with an agenda. Would that be a fair statement, 
do you think?
    Mr. Kelly. Yes. That can absolutely happen.
    Mr. Connolly. Thank you. I yield back.
    Ms. Mace. Thank you. I would like to say for the record, 
most Republicans in Congress are actually banned from Russia. 
And when we are talking about false sources, false information, 
we could look no further in 2020 than mainstream media that 
covered up the laptop, and the FBI and all those national 
security advisors that signed that letter. That was absolutely 
misinformation, disinformation right before an election. So, 
when we talk about foreign actors with an agenda, there are 
domestic actors with an agenda.
    So, I would now like to recognize Mr. Moylan for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Moylan. Thank you, Chairwoman Mace and Ranking Member 
Connolly, for allowing me to waive onto the hearing and speak 
on an issue that has plagued my district and the United States 
at large.
    The problem is clear. The People's Republic of China has 
unabashedly conducted cyber warfare against the United States 
for over a decade. The PRC uses proxy groups, like Volt 
Typhoon, to sidestep attribution for these cyberattacks. As a 
veteran, I can personally say that divesting cyberattacks on 
the Office of Personal Management in 2015 was a cyber wakeup 
call. While many cyberattacks target our Federal Government, 
Chinese hackers' indifference toward targeting civilians is 
apparent. Chinese leadership or their proxies has continued to 
demonstrate a lack of concern toward attacking civilian 
infrastructures. Regardless of source, the blatant disregard, 
even to the extent of launching cyberattacks during an active 
Category 5 typhoon on Guam, shutting down Guam's communications 
while extreme weather destroys billions of dollars' worth of 
homes, businesses, and community facilities, is simply 
inexcusable.
    So, my question, Mr. Evanina. Cyber represents a facet of 
Chinese gray zone warfare that the U.S. has struggled to 
contend with. Part of this problem stems from using cyber 
contractors to circumvent the Chinese Communist Party 
attributions for these attacks. With those companies in mind, 
could you recommend steps that the U.S. should take to properly 
distinguish who attacks us?
    Mr. Evanina. Congressman Moylan, I thank you for the 
question, and thank you for your support and efforts in Guam 
and the Pacific for us competing with our major adversary 
there. To answer your question, sir, I think the first thing 
has to happen, we have to be more aggressive as a country, as 
an Administration, working in partnership with Mandiant and 
others, to attribute these criminal entities as what they are. 
They are proxies for a state-sponsored organization that we 
know is the Communist Party of China.
    China actors who are in the administrative state security 
or the People's Liberation Army oftentimes work part-time jobs 
in these cyber organizations and do the bidding of the 
Communist Party of China, and oftentimes are utilized to do 
zero days and other cyber activities to obfuscate attribution 
by the Communist Party of China. I think we have to get more 
aggressive as a country in attributing those entities as what 
they are: long arms of the Communist Party of China.
    Mr. Moylan. Thank you. Mr. Joyce, with the limited cyber 
personnel already, Guam cyberinfrastructure suffers from 
deterioration and lack of funding, leaving civilian and 
military assets vulnerable to cyberattacks with Guam being one 
of the closest U.S. territories to China. What policy advice 
would you give the President, the Governor, or even myself to 
solve Guam's cyber insecurity?
    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Congressman, for your question. I 
think the most important thing is we have to have the awareness 
and the priority on this crisis to give them the resources to 
get rid of old, outdated, and insecure hardware. A lot of the 
tactics used in the attacks are finding flaws that could have 
and should have been patched in old and obsolete equipment. So, 
if you can get the budgets for the infrastructure so they will 
have cyber-capable training, so that they will get rid of their 
old and antiquated technology, and that they have the resources 
to get the support of the private industry with the expertise, 
I think we can make a lot of headway on this problem.
    Mr. Moylan. Perfect. Final question--we have got about a 
minute--for both of you, please. China is using national cyber 
power to harass districts and state-level actors. Could the 
panel briefly explain the necessity of developing Federal, 
state, or local cyber defense and responses?
    Mr. Evanina. Thank you, Congressman. I will start. I think 
the state and local and tribal cyber capabilities are the 
weakest point for our Nation. I think the Chinese Communist 
Party exploits that, especially at the county level. We see 
that throughout not only ransomware attacks, but also, as we 
will start to see, in election infrastructure, it is the 
weakest level. And oftentimes states throughout the United 
States do not have the money to invest and to replace the 
legacy hardware that Mr. Joyce talked about. I think that is 
going to be the first thing to do is to pay for that legacy 
information utilities to be removed.
    Mr. Moylan. Mr. Joyce?
    Mr. Joyce. I think it has got to be a close collaboration 
between the private sector and the state, local, and tribal 
entities. They are often resource and expertise poor. Someone 
going to school with a cybersecurity degree, they are not 
excited to go into the local water utility and be their CISO. 
So, we have got to then augment them with private industry and 
technology so that they can have top-notch security.
    Mr. Moylan. Thank you very much. Thank you to the panel. 
Thank you, Chairwoman Mace. Thank you.
    Ms. Mace. Thank you, Mr. Moylan, and we are going to go for 
a few extra minutes until votes, which could be in a minute, 
could be in 10 minutes, so I would like to recognize myself for 
5 minutes. I had a few extra followup questions I wanted to 
ask.
    Mr. Carmakal, rapid incident reporting by hack victims 
enables the identification of specific threats and limits the 
harm that they can inflict, but critical infrastructure 
operators vary widely in their knowledge of incident reporting 
protocols and in their compliance with them. So, what can be 
done to improve incident reporting by non-Federal entities?
    Mr. Carmakal. Yes. Thank you very much for the question, 
Chairwoman. Incident reporting is a very difficult topic 
because there are a number of equities that need to be 
balanced. You cannot disclose a security incident too early, 
especially if the threat actor still has access to the 
environment. They may do something more damaging, or they might 
escalate their attack, or they might steal more data. 
Obviously, you also do not want organizations to wait too long 
to disclose that there was a security event. And so, there is 
definitely a very tough balance in terms of how long it 
actually should take for an organization to disclose, but at a 
minimum, we do want organizations to disclose so that the whole 
of community has the opportunity to learn from it.
    Ms. Mace. Does the government provide clear guidance about 
these protocols?
    Mr. Carmakal. There are a number of regulations and 
requirements for disclosure, so it is confusing to certain 
organizations to understand who do they need to report to, when 
do they need to report it, and they typically have to engage 
legal counsels to help understand the reporting complexities.
    Ms. Mace. And if you are engaging legal counsels, probably 
pretty expensive for a business in some cases.
    Mr. Carmakal. It certainly could be expensive. Yes.
    Ms. Mace. Do companies ever get punished if they have been 
hacked by the government? Do they get sued? Is there that kind 
of thing going on, too, when these things happen?
    Mr. Carmakal. A lot of victims of cybercrime or 
cyberespionage feel like they are victimized multiple times. 
So, they are first victimized by the threat actor, then they 
might be victimized by the media, by their customers, by their 
partners. And so, yes, it is certainly complicated, and they do 
feel like they are victimized often.
    Ms. Mace. Is the government effectively sharing information 
it has about threat actors with the private sector?
    Mr. Carmakal. There is a lot of information sharing that is 
occurring from a government perspective. Obviously there could 
always be more information sharing, better information sharing, 
more timely sharing, but there is a lot of great things that 
are happening.
    Ms. Mace. That is good to hear. So, talk to me--in your 
testimony earlier, you talked about legacy systems for a little 
bit. Talk to me about that and what dire straits we are in 
right now with regards to our vulnerabilities.
    Mr. Carmakal. Yes. We very often find organizations that 
have antiquated technologies still deployed within their 
environment. Sometimes we see very old operating systems that 
are deployed that have not yet been retired but are still used 
for business-critical capabilities and functionality.
    Ms. Mace. What is the oldest one you have heard of? What 
has been around the longest?
    Mr. Carmakal. We still see Windows XP, which has been long 
end of light for quite some time.
    Ms. Mace. How long?
    Mr. Carmakal. I cannot remember how long it has been, but 
it is probably been more than a decade, if I am not mistaken. 
That is in the IT environments. When you look at OT 
environments or operations----
    Ms. Mace. Is that government specifically or are you just 
are saying private industry?
    Mr. Carmakal. Across the globe.
    Ms. Mace. Across.
    Mr. Carmakal. When you look at the systems that are 
controlling safety at nuclear power plants or manufacturing 
facilities or pipelines, what we tend to find is that there is 
very old technology that exists out there that you cannot 
actually apply software patches to. And so, in the IT world, 
you expect that you would have to apply a critical security 
patch in hours or days or maybe a month. In the operational 
technology world, sometimes the patch timing takes months, 
maybe a year, or maybe it never happens at all. Generally 
speaking, there are other compensating controls that help 
mitigate the risk of a compromise of an OT environment. But 
essentially, if a threat actor could get into an operational 
technology environment, it could be a pretty bad day for that 
organization because there are generally very little controls 
in those OT environments with very old technology.
    Ms. Mace. How do we incentivize technology updates, private 
and public sector?
    Mr. Carmakal. I defer to my colleagues on this panel for a 
proper response.
    Ms. Mace. All right. Mr. Joyce and Mr. Evanina?
    Mr. Joyce. I think one of the things you have to do is you 
have to look at regulation, right? We would not have antilock 
brakes and seat belts in our cars if it were just up to the 
industry. I am not a huge fan of regulation, but I am 
increasingly convinced that the bare cyber minimums need to be 
regulated.
    Ms. Mace. Mr. Evanina?
    Mr. Evanina. I would add out to that that I think it is 
about leadership, and it starts with the government. I think if 
the government earmarked significant dollars, moonshot, to 
update our own legacy systems would obviously prevent our 
adversaries from getting our government systems, and I think 
that would be a leading role to stimulate private sector to do 
the same.
    Ms. Mace. Yes. We have had a lot of hearings up here and 
the amount that is wasted even in tech. I mean, we had a 
hearing last year, and DoD had wasted $300 million on a 
software program. I can only imagine what we could have done 
with $300 million in the cybersecurity space, either hiring 
workers or updating and upgrading software packages and 
technology to keep them safer. So, I appreciate your time today 
and thank you for being here. Do you want to be recognized for 
5 minutes, Mr. Connolly?
    Mr. Connolly. I thank the Chair. I want to go back to the 
danger of relying on Russian and China sources because they 
have an active agenda of insinuating. We have established one 
that you are familiar with, Mr. Evanina, and that was a key 
source for Rudy Giuliani and his false claims about corruption 
involving Ukraine, Burisma, and then-Vice President Biden, and 
it is very dangerous to rely on sources like that.
    I want to point out three key sources for the impeachment 
inquiry on my other committee, the Oversight Committee, the 
full Committee, and on the Weaponization Committee: one, a man 
on the lam who has been charged by the U.S. Government for 
being a Chinese spy outright; second, a man who is in Federal 
prison today for having been convicted of fraud; third, a man 
named Alexei Smirnov, an FBI informant, in jail, charged by the 
FBI for lying to the FBI. He lied specifically about witnessing 
a cash bribe being given to President Biden, then-Vice 
President, or out of office, actually, and his son, Hunter. 
Neither was true. In fact, it has been established Mr. Smirnov 
did not even meet anyone from Burisma until 2 or 3 years after 
the alleged exchange. And furthermore, Mr. Smirnov has admitted 
that his sources were Russian agents. Other than that, these 
are reliable witnesses upon which one of the most solemn 
constitutional duties that falls upon Congress has occurred, 
the impeachment of a President. We relied on Russian and 
Chinese agents. That is an established fact.
    Mr. Evanina, what are the risks when political leaders 
assert that claims of Russian or Chinese interference are just 
a hoax? Could something go wrong when we do not take it 
seriously?
    Mr. Evanina. Ranking Member Connolly, I think it is 
important to note that we should fully expect the Communist 
Party of China, Russia, Iran, and others to participate in the 
same type of disinformation, misinformation in the upcoming 
election. And I think we have to be postured to be able to 
identify that quickly and notify the American public as fast 
and as furious as we can, and then take action to notify 
individuals who are either a part, wittingly or unwittingly, or 
being used by those nation-states to promulgate their 
information. So, I think that is really critical that we do 
that moving forward.
    Mr. Connolly. So, I do not want to put words in your mouth, 
but I am hearing you say, look, before we politically decide to 
dismiss something as an inconvenient fact, we need to have some 
skepticism about sourcing because of what Russia and China are 
doing.
    Mr. Evanina. Well, I think part of the playbook for Russia 
and China and others is to be able to sow doubt in all the 
reporting, and I think that is important. I think we should 
also take time to rely on the intelligence community, law 
enforcement, and the FBI to be able to most effectively weed 
out some of this information, to be able to be in the best 
posture to provide that to decisionmakers.
    Mr. Connolly. And that is what you did during the Trump 
Administration.
    Mr. Evanina. I think that is what the United States 
government----
    Mr. Connolly. Right. It is not a Democrat, or it should not 
be a Democrat or a Republican issue. Mr. Kelly, in your time in 
the FBI, does it echo what Mr. Evanina has cautioned us?
    Mr. Kelly. Yes, there was----
    Mr. Connolly. I cannot hear you.
    Mr. Kelly. Yes. In the last Administration, the Justice 
Department actually came out with a policy on this topic, which 
I think was actually a very wise approach, which is to flag the 
source of information. And so, to the extent that they have 
information that a malicious foreign actor has set up a false 
persona on social media, they cannotify the social media 
platform so that they can take action under their terms of use, 
but to not get into the business of fact-checking because that 
gets very, very tricky.
    So, I think where the facts are that we have identifiable 
bad foreign actors that are doing things, that is an 
opportunity then to notify the affected people, to notify 
technology platforms. And then when it relates to, 
specifically, the functions of an election, misinformation 
around that polls have closed or the polls are open, or the 
voting day moved, or whatever else is happening, those are the 
kinds of things that public officials need to come out and 
absolutely correct the factual record on.
    Mr. Connolly. Thank you, and I appreciate it. Thank you, 
Madam Chair.
    Ms. Mace. Thank you. And going back, just to clarify with 
Alexei Smirnov, this Committee was actually told by the FBI--we 
did not know his name when we got the access to the FBI 1020 
form--but the FBI told this Oversight Committee ``that the 
witness was trustworthy and credible,'' also repeated by 
Democrat colleagues here on the Oversight Committee because 
that is what the FBI told us. And that witness actually was 
paid six figures by the FBI, over half a million dollars. So, I 
do not know if the FBI just was incompetent in paying a witness 
that was not trustworthy and credible, or if they were lying to 
Congress and this Committee when they said the witness was 
trustworthy and credible.
    And just a reminder, this hearing is about China. It is not 
about Russia, and we are talking about skepticism about 
sourcing. We should be very skeptical of mainstream media here 
today who has fed the American people lies, hook, line and 
sinker. And, in fact, the whole Russia hoax thing, Trump was 
not assisted by Russia. The Russia hoax was actually Joe Biden 
getting paid off with his family members by Russian oligarchies 
and then lying about it, and we saw that in the testimony of 
Hunter Biden and his deposition, and we have seen these lies 
told over and over again by my colleagues across the aisle. 
Every time it is an accusation, it is really a projection. So, 
with that, I will recognize Mr. Timmons for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Timmons. Thank you, Madam Chair. Back to China. I am 
going to talk about Huawei briefly, Mr. Evanina and Mr. Joyce. 
I am going to ask you some questions at the end of it.
    So, China was using Huawei to give next-generation wireless 
technology to developing countries and to developed countries, 
many of which were allies, and they were doing that at a rate 
that was beyond competitive. It was essentially subsidized, and 
the FBI was able to reach out to our allies and essentially 
say, hey, this is a really bad idea. They have a backdoor in 
security. Their servers are not secure. You are essentially 
letting the Chinese have all your data.
    And so what happened? Well, all of our allies said they 
either took steps to ban Huawei, or they changed their course 
and are now using more secure next-generation wireless 
technology. And that was done, basically, because the United 
States took a leadership role in informing our allies that 
China was not being a good actor, and it has caused Huawei to 
have to completely adjust their approach to the global economy. 
Is that fair, Mr. Joyce?
    Mr. Joyce. Absolutely.
    Mr. Timmons. OK. So, I think this is a great model. It is a 
great model of how we can address larger concerns. So, 
obviously, we are talking about cyberattacks, and there is no 
amount of money that the private or publicly held companies can 
spend to secure their networks from a government as big as 
China. There is just nothing they can do. It is not a question 
of if they are going to get a breach. It is a question of when. 
But what we can do is we can use the U.S. Government and use 
our allies to create a consequence.
    So, I do not see why the United States and like-minded 
countries cannot create a system--the biggest issue is 
attribution in this proposal. If a company is breached and 
receives damages and it is from a nation-state, I think that 
company should be able to go to the government and say, look, 
we do all of these things right to try to protect our data, but 
China came after us. We had a breach. It cost us this amount of 
money. Obviously, there is going to be a civil suit. They are 
going to have to settle that civil suit with all of the 
individuals who had data breached. And so, let us just say it 
is, I do not know, a hundred million dollars. So, then the 
United States says, all right, attribution is good. China did 
this. The government did this. Here is your hundred million 
dollars, and then go and use trade tariffs to essentially make 
the United States whole. If we create a system like that, it 
can create a deterrent threat to nation-states that are using 
cyberattacks as a tool. What do you all think? Is that 
something that we should consider doing, Mr. Evanina?
    Mr. Evanina. Congressman Timmons, yes, but I will caution 
the Subcommittee here that I think the back end of this is the 
concern I have looking at Huawei for 15 years. We were able to 
get the threat relayed to the Congress who acted and had rip-
and-replace legislation. The problem we have is Huawei is a 
legitimate business entity that functions fairly well with an 
intelligence collection apparatus tied to it. If we rip it, we 
need to replace it with something different. And the trouble we 
have had, because we do not have the innovation and technology 
based in the United States to replace Huawei, we are still 
stuck with Huawei across our country in our telecommunication 
systems. So, to your point, I agree with, but we also have to 
have something to replace Huawei with when we rip it out.
    Mr. Timmons. Mr. Joyce, do you think that the international 
community could create this deterrent threat that would hold 
China accountable? It is not just China. It is China, North 
Korea, Iran, Russia, anybody that is using cyberattacks as 
basically a state tool. Is that something that we could do?
    Mr. Joyce. I do, Congressman, believe we have got to use 
all the elements of our national power, whether it is military, 
cyber, but increasingly commercial and tariff-related 
activities have proven pretty forceful, and we have seen the 
reactions to it. Unfortunately, a lot of these cyber criminals 
get to remain in places like North Korea, Russia out of the 
reach of law enforcement cooperation, and so we have got to 
have other tools beyond law enforcement.
    Mr. Timmons. So, I think that we can resolve that by saying 
that any individual that is attacking the United States, I 
mean, it is no different than the Taliban. I mean, we sent 
hundreds of thousands of U.S. soldiers and waged war for 
decades in Afghanistan because the Taliban allowed Al-Qaeda to 
use it as base of operations to attack the Twin Towers. So, I 
mean, there is no difference if Al-Qaeda was using a computer 
in Afghanistan and using code to crash an energy grid in a hot 
area in the summer or a cold area in the winter. I mean, it 
could legitimately kill thousands and thousands of people if we 
are unable to provide heat in the Northeast during a winter 
storm. And it would be very easy to do that, and we would have 
to hold that individual accountable, but we would have to hold 
the country that gave them safe harbor accountable. I mean, do 
we agree on this?
    Mr. Evanina. I completely agree, and I think your analogy 
is right with the terrorism because if Al-Qaeda had pre-
deployed explosives or electrical magnetic capability in New 
York City, is that different than Volt Typhoon and what they 
are doing here to potentially cause harm to our critical 
infrastructure? We have to look at that as a simple model.
    Mr. Timmons. And if there was a cyberattack on Goldman 
Sachs resulting in a half a billion dollars in damages, are we 
not going to then make them whole when they did nothing wrong 
versus if Hamas bombs their building? I mean, we are going to 
make them whole, so I do not think that we should view a 
terrorist cyberattack any differently than we would view a 
missile because there is no difference, effectively.
    OK. I am over time. Sorry. Thank you for your----
    Ms. Mace. I agree. Cybersecurity is national security. 
Thank you, Mr. Timmons.
    In closing, I want to thank our panelists who are here this 
afternoon, once again, for your testimony today.
    With that, and without objection, all Members will have 5 
legislative days within which to submit materials and to submit 
additional written questions for the witnesses, which will then 
be forwarded to the witnesses for their response.
    So, if there is no further business, without objection, the 
Subcommittee stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 5:10 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

                                 [all]
