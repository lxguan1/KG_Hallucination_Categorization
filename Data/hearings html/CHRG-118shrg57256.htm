                                       U.S. Senate,
           Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety,
       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:01 p.m., in 
room 562, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. John 
Hickenlooper, Chairman of the Subcommittee, presiding.

    Present: Senators Hickenlooper [presiding], Casey, Kaine, 
Markey, Braun, and Budd.

               OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR HICKENLOOPER

    Senator Hickenlooper. The Subcommittee on Employment and 
Workplace Safety will come to order. We are here today to talk 
about preparing workers across America to effectively use AI in 
the workplace.

    Ranking Member Braun and I will each give an opening 
statement, then we will introduce the witnesses. After 
witnesses give their testimony, each Senator, those of us here, 
watching online, or coming into the meeting will each have 5 
minutes to ask their questions.

    Last year, this Subcommittee heard from witnesses on the 
potential benefits of AI to our economy but concluded that 
those benefits will only become a reality if we have a well-
trained workforce.

    Since then, AI has only continued to explode with 
innovation and has remained at the forefront of conversations 
for both employers and workers, as new applications of AI 
continue to transform the workplace.

    Unlike most previous technologies--like all previous 
technologies, previous technologies like personal computers or 
cell phones, they initially had substantial barriers that 
limited consumer access.

    AI is already--has achieved wide access. AI powered 
applications are being used by students and workers and 
business owners all across the country. By some estimates, more 
than 60 percent of companies are exploring how to integrate 
some form of generative AI technology, even as we speak.

    Additionally, some workers already have their own 
subscriptions to AI applications and are using them to enhance 
their work, to accelerate their projects. Bottom line, AI 
clearly does have the potential to change how we all work.

    While some tasks may become more automated, the majority of 
jobs will use processes that employ in some form of 
collaboration between AI and human run systems. Despite the 
clear interest in AI technologies from employers and workers 
alike, we have more work to do to create widely available AI 
literacy training opportunities to put everyone on an even 
playing field.

    The rapidly changing landscape in AI technologies is making 
some employers and even some industries hesitant to invest in 
comprehensive training opportunities. They are not sure if what 
they are training will be useful and remain relevant in a 
relatively short period of time.

    But we know that having a well-trained and informed 
workforce is a key--it is really essential to making sure that 
AI is used responsibly, and that both workers and businesses 
can reap the full benefits of the tools.

    For example, human talent is needed to evaluate outputs 
generated by AI for accuracy or to tailor AI generated concepts 
into customized solutions that support their customers. AI 
literacy should also include an emphasis on methods to help 
workers identify AI generated content versus human generated 
content.

    AI literacy training is going to help empower employers to 
choose the safest applications for their workforce and make 
sure workers can give well informed feedback about their 
experience with AI.

    I think we have read the room and now is the time to make 
sure every worker has access to the professional development 
training that they need to succeed. That is why earlier this 
year, we introduced the Lifelong Learning Act with Senators 
Budd and Peters to make sure we can appropriately invest in 
training opportunities for current and future workers.

    Senator Braun and I have also been working together to make 
sure that the Department of Labor, as well as other agencies, 
understand the urgent need for these programs and need to 
address the safety factors connected to that urgent need.

    During today's hearing, we will hear from panelists from 
various sectors and communities who are providing or benefiting 
AI literacy training opportunities. As AI technologies and 
training programs change over time, we will need everyone, our 
union partners, employers, nonprofits, everyone to make sure 
that we get this right and we set ourselves up for success.

    Before I yield to Senator Braun for his opening remarks, I 
would like to enter into the record a statement from the AFL-
CIO Technology Institute about the importance of these 
partnerships, the importance of workers' voices as we scale 
training opportunities.

    [The following information can be found on page 46 in 
Additional Material:]

    Senator Hickenlooper. With that, I will turn it over to 
Ranking Member Braun for his opening remarks and to introduce 
our first witness.

                   OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR BRAUN

    Senator Braun. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the 
witnesses for being here today. Since our Subcommittee's last 
hearing on this subject matter, AI technology has only 
advanced--its prevalence has only grown in the American 
workplace.

    Today, we are going to take a look at AI technology, how it 
is affecting employers and employees, and learn what they 
should be prepared for down the road. Prior to becoming a 
Senator, I spent 37 years running a logistics and distribution 
company and we poured technology into it.

    There is no doubt that when you use technology correctly, 
it gives you unbelievable benefits, but we have never seen this 
horizon before. Embracing technology should be beneficial to 
everyone. It generally has been.

    But here, when the people that have brought it to the 
forefront have issued it with a stark warning, be careful, we 
would actually like it to be regulated. You have never heard 
that in the past about most things that come to the 
marketplace.

    There is broad interest about this from across the 
political spectrum, and certainly it shouldn't be politicized 
along the way. If there is a role for Congress to play in 
regulating this technology, it should come from following 
careful consideration and informed recommendations from 
nonpartisan experts in all affected fields.

    It is going to take a different type of framework to fully 
implement and regulate such advanced technology. However, in 
doing so, the goal shouldn't be to kill the technology by 
smothering it, because if we do that, we never get to the point 
of how it is going to be beneficial.

    The past couple of years we have seen unprecedented 
development and adoption of it across industries. We must 
ensure that Government leaders are trained to keep up with the 
advancements in AI and recognize the benefits and risks of this 
powerful tool.

    In this place, and most governments, have been the slowest 
to embrace normal technology along the way. So it is critical 
that if we are going to try to do something to create a 
framework, that we learn something about it.

    Senator Gary Peters and I introduced the AI Leadership 
Training Act to create an AI training program for Federal 
supervisors and management officials. The aim of this bill is 
to help improve the Federal workforce's understanding of its 
applications and to ensure that leaders who oversee the use of 
these tools understand its full potential benefits and risks.

    Legislation like this is a small step to improve our 
understanding of this technology and how it will impact our 
workplaces in the immediate future. Today, we are going to hear 
from witnesses who will shed light on some of those 
expectations and will also provide examples of how AI is 
already affecting the American workplace.

    We should aspire to bring the technology to the point where 
it can create benefits for the workplace, but we should also 
continue to be mindful and have conversations about where this 
technology can take us along the way. That is the purpose of 
the hearing, and I look forward to it.

    Before I yield, Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit a 
letter from the National Retail Federation which outlines the 
views of the retail industry on this important matter.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Great. And were you going to 
introduce the first witness, Mr. Meyer?

    Senator Braun. After you say it is Okay to put this into 
the record.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Without objection.

    [The following information can be found on page 48 in 
Additional Material:]

    Senator Braun. There we go. Okay. Thank you. My privilege 
to introduce Mr. Ken Meyer. Mr. Meyer is a Senior Director of 
Human Resources at Ryan Health, which is based in New York 
City.

    He is an HR professional with nearly 40 years of experience 
and has served as a President of the New York City Chapter of 
the Society for Human Resource Management. We welcome your 
expertise here today. Thanks for being here.

  STATEMENT OF KEN MEYER, SENIOR DIRECTOR OF HUMAN RESOURCES, 
                 RYAN HEALTH, NEW YORK CITY, NY

    Mr. Meyer. Thank you very much, Senator Braun. Good 
afternoon, Chairman Hickenlooper and Ranking Member Braun. 
Thank you for bringing us together for this important 
conversation about preparing workers for AI.

    My name is Ken Meyer, and I am the immediate past President 
of the New York City Chapter of SHRM, the Society for Human 
Resource Management. As the trusted authority on all things 
work, SHRM as the foremost expert, researcher, advocate, and 
thought leader on issues and innovations impacting today's 
evolving workplaces.

    With nearly 340,000 members in 180 countries, SHRM touches 
the lives of more than 362 million workers and their families 
globally. I have over 35 years of human resources experience 
within the health care sector.

    I currently serve as the Senior Director of Human Resources 
at Ryan Health, a Manhattan based community health center with 
nearly 500 employees. My testimony today is on behalf of SHRM 
and does not necessarily reflect the views of Ryan Health. 
SHRM's research shows that workplaces around the country are 
already using AI to enhance their organization's capabilities.

    One in four organizations currently use AI to support HR 
related activities, with nearly two-thirds of these adopters 
implementing AI in HR within the past year. A SHRM survey from 
earlier this year finds that among HR leaders whose 
organizations are currently using generative AI, 75 percent 
report that it has enhanced efficiency, 69 percent say it has 
increased creativity, and 65 percent say it has improved work 
quality.

    As more businesses embrace AI, American workers will need 
opportunities to learn, adapt, and use this technology to 
remain competitive. SHRM's research shows that 30 percent of HR 
leaders already feel greater pressure to innovate, and 28 
percent believe there is an increased need to upskill and 
reskill workers.

    Because of this, AI curiosity and AI literacy are new, 
must-have skills for workers in nearly everywhere role. 
Workers, including their managers, need to understand both the 
opportunities and risks presented by AI.

    This training helps managers identify when AI can enhance 
efficiency and when it is inappropriate or too risky to use so 
they can manage these risks. SHRM supports thoughtful 
legislation and regulation that promotes rather than stifles 
workplace and workforce innovation.

    However, state and local legislative and regulatory efforts 
regarding AI are creating a confusing patchwork of obligations 
for employers, putting some AI applications out of reach of the 
small and medium sized businesses because of the cost and 
uncertainty of regulatory compliance.

    Last year, New York City began imposing new requirements on 
employer uses of automated employment decision tools. The cost 
of complying with the new law and the uncertainty regarding AI 
regulation mean that employers, especially small and medium 
sized businesses, may choose not to use AI, which unfortunately 
may place them at a competitive disadvantage.

    SHRM believes that overlapping laws and regulations 
regarding AI may lead to unintended consequences that create 
uncertainty and discourage workplace innovation. SHRM supports 
a uniform Federal standard that provides a clear framework for 
how employers should strive to prevent unlawful bias when using 
AI.

    We also support Federal efforts to educate all stakeholders 
about the benefits and risks of AI in the workplace. As the 
trusted thought leader on all things work, SHRM is committed to 
helping employers responsibly navigate this new landscape, 
ensuring that AI enhances the workplace without compromising 
fairness, inclusion, and diversity.

    We also stand ready to provide Congress with our expertise 
on workplace issues to ensure that you are fully informed about 
the potential consequences of forthcoming public policy and 
legislative efforts.

    Thank you again for this opportunity to speak today and I 
look forward to hearing your questions.

                             Introduction:
    Chairman Hickenlooper, Ranking Member Braun, and distinguished 
Members of the HELP Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety, 
thank you for bringing us together for this important conversation 
about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the workforce. My 
name is Ken Meyer, and I had the honor in 2023 of serving as President 
of the New York City chapter of the Society for Human Resource 
Management (SHRM). Today, I am here to share insights on behalf of 
SHRM, the foremost expert, researcher, advocate, and thought leader on 
issues impacting today's evolving workplaces.

    As the trusted authority on all things work, SHRM is the foremost 
expert, researcher, advocate, and thought leader on issues and 
innovations impacting today's evolving workplaces. With nearly 340,000 
members in 180 countries, SHRM touches the lives of more than 362 
million workers and their families globally.

    I serve as Senior Director for HR for Ryan Health, a Manhattan-
based community nonprofit healthcare provider with nearly 500 
employees. I have over 35 years of human resource (HR) experience 
within the healthcare industry. My written testimony is on behalf of 
SHRM and does not necessarily reflect the views of Ryan Health.
              The Intersection of AI and HR: The Benefits:
    SHRM research \1\ shows that 1 in 4 organizations (26 percent) 
currently use AI to support HR-related activities, with nearly two-
thirds of these adopters only implementing AI in HR within the past 
year. As the architects of talent and performance management, HR 
professionals are embracing AI to enhance their organizations' 
capabilities because AI offers a promising array of solutions to 
address the complex demands of the modern workplace. The top three 
areas where organizations are already using AI to support HR-related 
activities include recruitment, interviewing, and hiring (64 percent), 
learning and development (43 percent), and performance management (25 
percent).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\  SHRM's 2024 Talent Trends Survey was conducted in January 2024 
and collected responses from over 2,300 HR professionals representing 
organizations of all sizes and across a variety of industries in the 
United States. A summary excerpt of these research findings is 
available at https://shrm-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/AI/2024-
Talent-Trends-Survey--Artificial-Intelligence-Findings.pdf.

    Furthermore, the steady proliferation and integration of AI 
underscores the need for organizations to enhance AI curiosity and 
literacy to get the best return on investment. Another SHRM survey \2\ 
conducted in January and February 2024 finds that among HR leaders 
whose organizations are currently using generative AI, 75 percent 
report enhanced organizational efficiency, 69 percent say it has 
increased creativity, and 65 percent say it has improved work quality. 
SHRM's AI in the Workplace found U.S. workers recognize the need for 
various skills or competencies to effectively collaborate with AI 
technologies. U.S. workers identified ``technical skills to navigate 
interfaces and tools'' (72 percent), ``digital literacy'' (68 percent), 
and ``critical thinking skills'' (68 percent) as the top three 
competencies needed to effectively collaborate with AI technologies in 
the workplace.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\  SHRM conducted additional research, collecting 1,220 responses 
from HR leaders completed between January 25, 2024, and February 7, 
2024. The survey was fielded electronically using the SHRM Voice of 
Work Panel to U.S.-based HR leaders who hold a title of Director or 
higher and engage in HR activities. A copy of an article further 
summarizing this research is available at https://www.shrm.org/
executive-network/insights/new-shrm-research-shows-how-hr-leaders-
really-feel-about-ai.

    Three in four HR professionals believe that advancements in AI will 
increase the importance of human intelligence in the workplace over the 
next 5 years. SHRM believes it is essential to approach AI's adoption 
responsibly, and we are helping our members address ethical 
considerations, ensure transparency, and provide appropriate training. 
All are crucial aspects of a successful AI integration strategy that 
helps to reduce the risk of algorithmic discrimination.
     AI + HI [Human Intelligence] Equals ROI [Return on Investment]
    As organizations eagerly adopt AI technologies, grasping their 
potential to create value will be essential for making informed 
decisions. To successfully navigate workforce changes during this 
significant technological transformation, individuals at all levels of 
the workforce must learn how to \3\:

        markets, people, and disruptive technologies intersect with the 
        challenges of human intelligence. As generative AI becomes more 
        integrated into our daily lives, we will learn how to unlock 
        potential, spark innovation, and discern our unique human

        qualities from AI.

        `  Augment the power of people to drive the world forward. To 
        flourish in the AI era, we must rethink work, workers, and 
        workplaces--reimagining a world of work where human 
        intelligence and ingenuity are upskilled, not replaced.

        `  Engender a culture of change and invest in human catalysts. 
        Studies show human catalysts are key to successful AI 
        integrations. Organizations must invest in their people to 
        empower the mindsets, skill sets, and toolsets to drive 
        thriving, responsible workplace transitions.

    As SHRM President and Chief Executive Officer Johnny C. Taylor, Jr. 
has said, ``The opportunities AI presents are limitless. When combined 
with human ingenuity (HI), this synergy has the capacity to transform 
your organization while maximizing human potential. AI + HI = ROI.'' 
SHRM believes that while AI can help augment and automate routine 
tasks, we will reach our fullest potential by combining AI with human 
intelligence and oversight. Through this combination of technology with 
human intelligence, HR professionals are achieving positive outcomes. 
Below are examples of how SHRM's members are combining AI with HI 
across a wide range of HR applications and industries:

        ``We were having a hard time filling lower-skill-level 
        positions [ . . . ] due to the requirement that these workers 
        needed a high school diploma. By having AI scan for experience 
        instead of just a high school diploma, we were able to increase 
        our applicant pool and fill positions we were having a hard 
        time retaining. Our retention level in these jobs has risen, 
        and we have eliminated the requirement of a high school diploma 
        for these positions.''

        --Large employer in the Health Care industry

        ``Recruiting is one instance. AI may identify a passive 
        candidate that we were unaware of. We have chosen to interview 
        and hire someone that has come to our notice this way.''

        --Large employer in the Retail industry

        ``Chatbots are creating 24/7 access to answers, which improves

        from. We use human intelligence to conduct a gap analysis of 
        what might be crucial learning that is overlooked because of 
        how the AI provides pathways for people and then find ways to 
        push those overlooked training topics to relevant people.''

          The Increased Demand for AI Literacy and Upskilling
    As more businesses embrace AI, American workers will need 
opportunities to learn, adapt, and use AI to remain competitive in the 
global job market. SHRM's research \4\ shows that 30 percent of HR 
leaders already feel greater pressure to innovate, and 28 percent 
believe there is an increased need to upskill and reskill workers. AI 
curiosity and AI literacy are becoming essential skills for employees 
in nearly every role in the workforce.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\  SHRM conducted additional research, collecting 1,220 responses 
from HR leaders completed between January 25, 2024, and February 7, 
2024. The survey was fielded electronically using the SHRM Voice of 
Work Panel to U.S. based HR leaders who hold a title of Director or 
higher and engage in HR activities. A copy of an article further 
summarizing this research is available at https://www.shrm.org/
executive-network/insights/new-shrm-research-shows-how-hr-leaders-
really-feel-about-ai.

        `  The increased demand for AI literacy and upskilling is 
        critical to the modern workforce. As AI continues to transform 
        workplaces, it is essential for employees to develop the skills 
        needed to work alongside these technologies. A SHRM Current 
        Events Pulse \5\ survey in August 2024 revealed that most 
        workers are still at the start of their AI journeys. For 
        example:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\  August 2024 Current Events Pulse, SHRM, 2024

                Y  80 percent of U.S. workers classify their 
                understanding of AI as either beginner or intermediate, 
                while only 20 percent say they are at an advanced or 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                expert level.

                Y  Nearly a quarter of U.S. workers (22 percent) lack 
                any experience with AI, while 63 percent classify their 
                AI proficiency as beginner or intermediate. Only 15 
                percent of workers say they have advanced or expert-
                level experience with AI.

    Moreover, SHRM's research shows that the increased demand for AI 
literacy and upskilling is disproportionately borne by older 
generations, who are significantly more likely to say they are at a 
beginner or intermediate level of AI understanding compared to younger 
workers.

    By investing in training programs and promoting AI literacy, 
organizations can ensure that their workforce remains competitive and 
can leverage AI to drive workplace innovation and productivity.

    To address the growing need for AI literacy, many companies are 
investing in upskilling and reskilling initiatives, using the 
technology to create personalized learning and development 
opportunities. These programs are designed to help employees develop 
the skills they need to work alongside AI technologies. Training helps 
managers identify when generative AI can enhance efficiency and when it 
is inappropriate or too risky to use.

    SHRM has been actively preparing employers and HR professionals to 
navigate the implementation of AI in the workplace. By providing 
comprehensive resources and expert guidance, SHRM helps organizations 
understand the potential of AI to enhance productivity and innovation. 
This includes:

        `  Developing a robust toolkit for using AI in employment: \6\ 
        SHRM offers resources that help HR professionals understand how 
        to integrate AI into various HR functions, such as talent

        `  Collaborating with industry experts: SHRM works with experts 
        to develop best practices for integrating AI into HR functions, 
        ensuring that organizations can harness the benefits of AI 
        while mitigating risks.
               Legislative and Regulatory Considerations:
    SHRM is working to educate its members regarding both the benefits 
and the risks of AI, and steps that should be taken to mitigate these 
risks. SHRM supports thoughtful legislation and regulation that 
promotes, rather than stifles, workplace and workforce innovation. 
State and local legislative and regulatory efforts regarding AI are 
creating a patchwork of obligations for employers, putting some AI 
applications out of reach for small and medium-sized businesses due to 
the cost and uncertainty of regulatory compliance.

    For example, small and medium-sized organizations operating in New 
York City are navigating unique regulatory environments. Last year, New 
York City Local Law 144 became effective, imposing new requirements 
when an employer uses ``automated employment decision tools.'' The cost 
of complying with New York City's new law and the uncertainty regarding 
AI regulation mean that small and medium-sized businesses may avoid 
leveraging AI's potential until there is stability, placing them at a 
competitive disadvantage.

    SHRM is concerned that a patchwork of state and local overlapping 
laws and regulations regarding AI may lead to unintended consequences 
that create uncertainty and discourage workplace innovation. SHRM 
supports a uniform Federal standard that provides a clear framework for 
how employers should strive to prevent unlawful bias and promote 
responsible workplace applications of AI. We also support Federal 
efforts to educate stakeholders about the benefits and risks of AI in 
the workplace.
                               Conclusion
    The rapid evolution of AI brings both incredible opportunities and 
significant challenges. Lawmakers must work with multiple stakeholders 
to identify ways to meet these challenges, and to create a regulatory 
landscape that enables workers and businesses to achieve the benefits 
of AI responsibly and consistent with our shared values. SHRM hopes 
that lawmakers, employers, workers, and other stakeholders can work 
together to achieve these goals and address these concerns.

    SHRM is committed to helping employers and HR professionals 
responsibly navigate this new landscape, ensuring that AI enhances the 
workplace without compromising our shared values. We stand ready to 
provide Congress with our expertise on workplace issues to ensure you 
are fully informed about the potential consequences of forthcoming 
public policy and legislative efforts. Thank you for the opportunity to 
submit this testimony to the Employment and Workplace Safety 
Subcommittee about this critical issue.

pleasure to introduce our next witness, Dr. Karin Kimbrough, 
national expert on skills attainment.

   STATEMENT OF KARIN KIMBROUGH, CHIEF ECONOMIST, LINKEDIN, 
                         SUNNYVALE, CA

    Dr. Kimbrough. Chairman Hickenlooper, Ranking Member Braun, 
and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to 
testify today. My name is Dr. Karin Kimbrough, and I serve as 
the Chief Economist at LinkedIn.

    I appreciate the opportunity to share our insights on how 
AI is impacting the economy, including skills, jobs, and 
industries. We believe that AI holds great promise and 
potential to enhance the productivity of workers and to allow 
them to focus on more meaningful aspects of their jobs.

    With AI tools becoming accessible to the workforce at 
large, the impact will be widespread. AI is here and it is 
changing the way we work. Today, I want to discuss three key 
trends from our data.

    First, we are already seeing early influences of AI on jobs 
and skills. Second, employers are increasingly placing a 
premium on hiring and training AI talent. And third, workers 
are realizing the value and benefits of acquiring AI skills.

    Finally, I will touch briefly on the global AI talent 
marketplace and offer ideas and policy suggestions for this 
Committee to consider. At LinkedIn, we think about AI talent in 
two ways, the technical builders who are developing AI tools 
and the general users that will need to be AI literate.

    The earliest indicators of how firms are responding to the 
technological promise of AI comes from our hiring data. So far 
this year, the demand for AI skills has increased. For example, 
we have seen a 30 percent increase in the share of job postings 
for AI technical talent compared to 2023.

    The increase in demand has been even faster in the 
technology industry. This increase in demand for AI technical 
talent is also shifting the skills needed for today's jobs 
across all industries.

    Since 2015, the skills for the average job have changed by 
about 25 percent, and we expect this change to accelerate. By 
2030, two-thirds of what we do at work every day will look very 
different. Despite this rapid change in skills, companies that 
use AI are not just hiring new workers with these skills but 
are also initiating internal training programs to upskill their 
own workers.

    One example of this employer provided training is NIQ, a 
U.S. based marketing research firm. It has been using LinkedIn 
learning for employee training, including AI. More than 1,900 
employees participated in NIQ's AI learning challenge, logging 
over 18,000 hours of AI learning content in the last year.

    Additionally, employers are looking to do more training. 
The Census Bureau has found that one in five companies using AI 
had recently trained its staff to use it, and nearly half of 
other companies plan to offer training in the next 6 months.

    Workers are also taking the initiative. They are upskilling 
on their own and going beyond what employers are providing as 
they begin to identify the opportunities of AI in their own 
work.

    Over the last 6 months, we have seen a 160 percent increase 
in non-technical professionals who are taking LinkedIn learning 
courses to grow their AI literacy. These are workers in roles 
like project manager, architect, administrative assistant, and 
more than half of a million learners have enrolled in our 
professional certificates for AI.

    In a competitive labor market, workers see the value of 
making their new AI skills known, and around the world there 
are now 142 times as many members with AI literacy skills than 
there were just late last year.

    All of this matters on a global scale. For example, the 
U.S. has a third of the world's AI technical talent and a third 
of the world's workers with AI literacy skills. However, other 
countries like India are developing their AI talent at a faster 
rate and are catching up.

    As this Committee looks ahead at policies to prepare 
workers for AI, there are four areas on which I would encourage 
you to focus. First, continue the bipartisan efforts to promote 
policies which expand skills based hiring in this country.

    Second, consider ways in which the reauthorization of WIOA 
can help meet the needs of workers in the new economy. Third, 
support efforts to encourage and enable employers, specifically 
small businesses, to upskill their workers.

    Finally, ensure that Federal labor data are able to capture 
the impact of AI on our Nation's workforce accurately and in a 
timely manner, including by leveraging public-private 
partnerships. Thank you for this opportunity to share more 
about LinkedIn's insights, and I look forward to your 
questions.

    [The prepared statement of Ms. Kimbrough follows.]
                 prepared statement of karin kimbrough
    Chair Hickenlooper, Ranking Member Braun, and Members of the 
Subcommittee: thank you for inviting me to testify today.

    My name is Dr. Karin Kimbrough, and I am the Chief Economist at 
Linkedln. I lead a team of economists and data scientists dedicated to 
understanding how the world of work is evolving through what we call 
the Economic Graph Research Institute (EGRI). We study workplace trends 
and shifts in the macro economy, identify opportunities for 
professionals in a wide range of roles and occupations, and strive to 
understand the relative demand for work across multiple industries 
worldwide. I have worked in the public and private sectors on 
macroeconomic research and finance for over 20 years, including nearly 
a decade at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where I was a vice 
president in the Markets Group.

    I appreciate the opportunity to share our insights on how the 
increased deployment of artificial intelligence (Al) applications in 
nearly every industry is affecting the workforce and work. Linkedln is 
the world's largest professional network with more than 1 billion 
members in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide. Our data 
provides us with real-time, granular insights that enable us to conduct 
extensive research on Al as it relates to jobs, skills, workers, and 
the emerging global Al economy.

    We believe Al holds great promise and potential to enhance the 
productivity of workers, and to allow workers to focus on more 
meaningful aspects of their jobs.

    There are three broad points which I would like to highlight from 
our insights and other research, which are relevant to today's hearing.

    First, our early observations suggest Al is already impacting jobs 
and skills; second, employers are placing a premium on Al talent and 
employer-driven Al training; and third, workers are increasingly 
realizing the value and benefits of acquiring Al skills.

    Finally, I will touch upon the global context of Al supply and 
demand, and the policies we encourage this Committee to consider to 
further expand access and opportunities for Al skilling.

                   I. Al is Impacting Jobs and Skills

    Almost a year ago, this Subcommittee held a hearing focused on Al 
and the future of work, with the expectation that Al, and Generative Al 
in particular, would have a growing impact on jobs and workers. Over 
the past year, we have seen this become a reality.

    Al is here, and it is changing the way we work. The earliest 
indicators of this evolution come from our data around the hiring of Al 
technical talent--meaning those with Al engineering skills, who are 
critical to enabling companies to build the right tools for Al 
implementation and adoption at scale.

    LinkedIn hiring data show that there was a 6 percent increase in 
hiring for Al technical talent in the United States in the first 12 
months after ChatGPT launched. This reflects an acceleration in demand 
for Al expertise and is an important initial step in firms' success in 
deploying Al more broadly. \1\ This hiring increase coincided with a 
hiring slowdown in the Technology industry at large (^10 percent y/y), 
and the United States overall (^10 percent y/y). \2\ Further, data over 
the last 8 years show that hiring for Al technical talent has increased 
by more than 300 percent globally. \3\

    Beyond demand for Al technical talent, we see an emerging impact of 
Generative Al and Al tools on the broader workforce. In particular, the 
wider accessibility of these new technologies to a non-technical 
workforce using equipped smartphones and laptops suggests that the 
speed of diffusion will be faster than prior technological innovations. 
In other words, the impacts of this technology will be widespread, 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
crossing industries, jobs, and skills.

    The extent to which Al has penetrated the global workforce is quite 
remarkable. Microsoft and Linkedln released the 2024 Work Trend Index 
Report, which surveyed 31,000 people across 31 countries, and found 
that 75 percent of global knowledge workers report using Generative Al 
at work. Equally striking is the speed at which this is happening. The 
survey found that 46 percent of those Al users report that they started 
using it less than 6 months ago. \4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\  Microsoft and Linkedln, 2024.

    As Al is becoming more ingrained in our daily work, we're seeing 
new jobs being created and the skill sets for roles shift. The number 
of companies with a ``Head of Al'' position has tripled in the past 5 
years and grew by more than 28 percent in 2023. Globally, 12 percent of 
recruiters now say they are creating new roles tied specifically to the 
use of Generative Al. \5\ As an example of how jobs are changing, our 
data show the skills needed for the average job have changed by 25 
percent since 2015. By 2030, we expect skills to change by more than 
two-thirds, with tools like Generative Al accelerating this change. \6\ 
In other words, for many of us, two-thirds of what we do at work every 
day will look very different in just a few short years.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We also expect Al and Generative Al to impact a wide number of the 
jobs and occupations held by workers today. To better understand what 
this impact is likely to look like, we have analyzed data across our 
platform to estimate the percentage of occupational skills that are 
complemented by Al and the percentage of skills that are replicable by 
Al. What we found, as highlighted in the chart below, is the impact Al 
will have on jobs will vary considerably. Some jobs, like translator, 
are likely to experience disruption because a significant portion of 
the skills can be replicated by Generative Al. As a result, these 
workers will need extensive training to develop new Al-related skills 
to effectively integrate Al into their workflows. On the other hand, 
workers in other occupations, like physical therapists, will be largely 
insulated from Generative Al because many of the skills they use are 
complemented by Al, but not replicated by it. However, over time, we do 
expect that the vast majority of occupations--even ones that appear 
insulated for now--will eventually incorporate Generative Al into their 
tasks, with some occupations transforming more than others. \7\

generative-ai.pdf.

    By extension, this also means the workforces of certain 
industries are likely to be more directly impacted by Al than others. 
For example, we found that 50 percent of workers in the Financial 
Services industry are likely to face Al disruption in their jobs, 
compared to 36 percent of workers in the Technology industry and just 
18 percent of workers in Accommodation and Food Services. \8\ This 
points to the need for and value of working within sectors not only to 
better understand the potential impacts of Al, but to address worker 
needs, which I will discuss further below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\  Kimbrough and Carpanelli, 2023.

    Despite these projected disruptions, to date, recent Federal data 
suggest that the augmentation and disruption of these skills is not 
necessarily leading to people losing their jobs. According to recent 
U.S. Census Bureau data, employers in the U.S. have few plans to reduce 
their total employment due to Al. In fact, the percentage of employers 
anticipating an increase (6.5 percent) in employment edges out those 
anticipating a decrease (6.1 percent). \9\

    Consistent with these findings, our research shows that the 
adoption by firms of GitHub Copilot, a Generative Al powered code 
completion and automatic programming tool, boosts hiring by about 3 
percentage points, particularly for entry-and senior-level engineers, 
with firms hiring more software engineers overall. It also leads to a 7 
percent increase in job postings for software engineers on Linkedln, 
without displacing existing workers. \10\

 II. Employers are Placing a Premium on Al Talent and are Focusing on 
                                Training
    Employers are starting to see the advantage of Al and its capacity 
to increase productivity and, therefore, the need to hire workers with 
technical and broader Al literacy skills, by which we mean the 
familiarity with and ability to use Al tools. The 2024 Work Trend Index 
found that 66 percent of business leaders with decision-making 
authority said they wouldn't hire someone without Al skills, and 71 
percent said they'd rather hire a less experienced candidate with Al 
skills than a more experienced candidate without them. \11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \11\  Microsoft and Linkedln, 2024.

    If these global survey results hold true in the coming years, we 
expect to see the demand for those with Al skills, both in engineering 
and literacy, to quickly outpace supply given the labor pool largely 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
lacks these skills.

    In the face of this challenge, a growing number of employers are 
realizing the need not only to seek out new workers with Al skills, but 
more importantly, to develop their own Al workforce--including both Al 
technical and Al literate talent.

    As an example, NIQ, a U.S.-based marketing research firm out of 
Chicago that uses Linkedln Learning, has been working to train their 
workers on Al. In the last 12 months, NIQ employees have watched more 
than 73,000 total hours of Linkedln Learning content and, when looking 
at the types of courses NIQ employees are taking, five of the top ten 
courses are on Al. Additionally, more than 1,900 employees registered 
for NIQ's Al Learning challenge--during which employees watched more 
than 18,000 hours of Al learning content.

    Recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau point more broadly to this 
trend. The Business Outlook and Trends Survey found that the percentage 
of companies reporting plans to hire staff already trained in Al in the 
next 6 months will quadruple compared to those who reported hiring 
trained staff in the past 6 months. While this change is significant, 
this trend is dwarfed by the percentage of companies who report 
planning to offer Al training to their workers, which will double from 
21 percent reporting having trained current staff in the past 6 months 
to 42 percent planning to provide training in the next 6 months. This 
tells us that companies know they need to train their own workers in Al 
because outside talent is still skilling up and not yet available in 
large numbers. \12\

    While this data points to a positive trend, the fact remains that 
employers in the U.S. could be doing more to ensure their employees 
have the Al skills necessary to fully adopt Al into their work. In 
fact, we found that only a quarter of Learning and Development teams 
globally plan to offer training programs on how to use Generative Al 
this year. \14\

    Business leaders who fail to devote the resources necessary to 
reskill and upskill their Al talent risk falling behind companies who 
are making these investments and seeing productivity gains from 
leveraging this technology.
Ill. Workers are Increasingly Seeing the Value of Acquiring Al Literacy 
                                 Skills
    Our data show that workers recognize the value of Al skills in an 
increasingly competitive labor market. We observe this keen interest by 
workers to upskill firsthand in our own Linkedln Learning data. 
Linkedln Learning currently offers over 1,000 courses on Al, from 
learning basic Al principles, concepts, and applications to advancing 
skills in machine learning. Since January 1, 2023, the number of people 
taking Linkedln Learning courses on Al has grown by 13 times. \15\ As 
of earlier this year, the use of Linkedln Learning courses designed to 
build Al literacy skills spiked 160 percent among non-technical 
professionals, with workers in roles like project managers, architects, 
and administrative assistants looking to skill up the most. \16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \15\  Linkedln Learning, 2024.
    \16\  Microsoft and Linkedln, 2024.

    Workers recognize that acquiring Generative Al and other Al skills 
not only makes them more competitive but also can render work more 
productive, safer, and potentially more interesting. According to the 
Work Trend Index, workers who are using Al tools report that Al helps 
them save time (90 percent), focus on their most important work (85 
percent), be more creative (84 percent), and enjoy their work more (83 
percent). \17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \17\  Microsoft and Linkedln, 2024.

    Workers also understand the value of making it known to their 
current or prospective employers that they have acquired these 
competencies. Our data show there are now 142 times as many members 
with Al literacy skills on their Linkedln profiles than there were last 
year. \18\

    While it is encouraging that so many workers are able to seek out 
their own training opportunities, we know this is not enough. There are 
still barriers in place that prevent access to these opportunities 
across multiple occupations. We believe a more coordinated and 
widespread effort is necessary to ensure that all workers have the 
ability to gain the necessary Al skills.
                           The Global Context
    With respect to Al skills globally, we see that the U.S. has 31 
percent of the world's Al technical talent and that other countries are 
picking up the pace. For instance, the concentration of this talent in 
the U.S. increased by 13 percent from 2022 to 2023. Over the same 
period, the growth in Al technical talent was faster in the United Arab 
Emirates (29 percent y/y), India (24 percent y/y), Saudi Arabia (21 
percent y/y), the United Kingdom (16 percent y/y), and Canada (15.4 
percent y/y). The pace of growth of Al technical talent was relatively 
modest in Germany (9.5 percent y/y) and France (2.1 percent y/y). \19\

    Similarly for members with Al literacy skills, over 30 percent of 
members with these skills are in the United States, closely followed by 
India at 29 percent. \20\ We expect demand for this talent to continue 
to grow in the U.S. and around the world.

                         Policy Considerations
    I commend this Subcommittee for seeking to better understand the 
impact and opportunities of Al. As you continue your work in this area, 
we would encourage you to consider policies that accelerate Al adoption 
across our Nation, and ensure it benefits those who don't have access 
to training or who need additional support to gain these skills.

    The Committee's current effort to reauthorize the Workforce 
Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) provides one way in which to 
support such individuals from across all sectors, as the economy shifts 
toward an Al-driven future.

    Congress can also promote the adoption of skills-based hiring as a 
way to provide more opportunities to those who may have in-demand Al 
skills but may lack a traditional 2-or 4-year degree. Skills-first 
hiring allows companies to tap into a broader talent pool, including 
individuals who have gained relevant skills through non-traditional 
pathways such as bootcamps, online courses, or self-study. This 
approach can be particularly beneficial in rapidly evolving fields like 
Al, where the demand for specific skills often outpaces the supply of 
formally qualified candidates.

    We appreciate the opportunity to work with Members of the 
Subcommittee on this and other legislation and look forward to 
collaborating on support for workers and employers who seek to take 
advantage of the benefits Al has to offer, including small businesses, 
many of which may benefit from the potential for Al tools to increase 
efficiencies and productivity.

    Finally, we would encourage you to consider how to bolster Federal 
data, including through public-private partnerships, to better 
understand how Al is impacting the workforce.

    Thank you for the opportunity to join you here today and I look 
forward to answering any questions.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Dr. Kimbrough. Now we will 
hear from Mr. Kotran. Mr. Kotran serves as the Chief Executive 
Officer for aiE-D-U. I guess you could say aiEDU, an education 
based nonprofit that partners with education and technology 
experts across the country to provide AI literacy training for 
our educators.

    Mr. Kotran.

 STATEMENT OF ALEX KOTRAN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AIEDU, SAN 
                         FRANCISCO, CA

    Mr. Kotran. Thank you. Good afternoon, Members of the 
Subcommittee. I want to--really appreciate the opportunity to 
testify today. My name is Alex Kotran and CEO of the AI 
Education Project.

    We are a nonprofit and our mission is to bring AI readiness 
to classrooms nationwide by empowering our teacher workforce. 
Today, I appear before you today to underscore the urgent need 
to massively expand investment in teacher training and 
professional development.

    We need to ensure that we are preparing students for the 
profound changes that are coming with the disruption that AI is 
going to bring to our society and indeed our workforce. aiEDU 
is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.

    We were founded 5 years ago, and we have been leading a 
national movement to advance AI readiness and AI literacy. We 
define AI literacy as the collection of skills and knowledge 
that a person needs to confidently understand, ethically use, 
and critically evaluate artificial intelligence in a world in 
which AI is becoming more and more ubiquitous.

    We define AI readiness as the durable skills and the 
competencies that students, teachers, and school systems are 
going to need in order to apply AI literacy. Our work is 
anchored on a sophisticated national grassroots operation, and 
we partner with some of the largest districts and education 
systems in the country.

    We stand at the dawn of a transformative era. The AI 
revolution is going to define the trajectory of an entire 
generation of students and workers, and it is going to 
fundamentally change the skills they need to compete in that 
workforce.

    The urgency and the pace of this challenge is hard to 
overstate. Less than 2 years ago, large language models or LLMs 
were virtually nonexistent. And today, hundreds of millions of 
people are using them every day, and we are starting to see 
meaningful applications that are resulting in significant 
impacts on the future of work.

    I am going to highlight one example. Last month, Amazon CEO 
Andy Jassy shared that their AI coding assistant, Amazon Q, 
made eye popping advances in replacing and augmenting the 
company's software engineers. They replaced the equivalent of 
50 developer days for a very simple task uploading a Java 17 
application.

    In total, Jassy predicted that the tool has saved the 
equivalent of 4,500 developer years and more over 80 percent of 
the code that it writes does not require any editing by humans. 
Research into the potential impacts of LLMs in the workforce 
suggests wide ranging applications and displacement, 
concentrated in some of the most common knowledge work careers 
in the U.S..

    I think most concerning, the National Bureau of Economic 
Research has conducted a study that found that historically the 
pace of automation driven job displacement, it doesn't happen 
gradually, but rather it happens in these acute bursts in the 
months following recessions.

    I fear that the next recession, whenever it comes, will be 
the moment that we must all truly face the music. So what do we 
do? Our organization has learned in more than 5 years of 
working with educators and school leaders across the country 
that there is no one size fits all approach.

    We need to work state by state and in many cases district 
by district to create models that scale and massively invest in 
our teacher workforce.

    We have also leveraged partnerships with state agencies, 
school districts, and community organizations, all with the 
goal of building capacity amongst the teachers, the 
administrators, and the systems that support them to build the 
capacity and the competencies that they need to actually 
deliver and build the skills that ultimately students and 
workers are going to need.

    Our research underscores the urgency. What we found is that 
72 percent of teachers when surveyed report only being 
moderately comfortable with AI at best. For our Country to 
build a base of new skills, we need to significantly increase--
decrease that number, rather. The goal of our education system 
must be to include an expanded focus on durable skills.

    We have to focus on critical thinking, communication, 
collaboration, resilience, adaptability, and digital 
citizenship, and these are best developed through live, 
engaging classroom activities facilitated by real educators. We 
believe that a range of AI competencies must be widely 
understood and achieved in our education system.

    These include knowing the basics of AI, yes, but also being 
able to understand when to use AI, and when to bring in and 
leverage the human advantage.

    In terms of recommendations, we really need to push forward 
a coordinated and concerted effort at the national, state, 
regional, and local levels to elevate the conversation and push 
for action around the skills and training for both teachers and 
students, and indeed our workers.

    Congress can create the right conditions first and foremost 
by routing more funds and creating the supports and the 
necessary investments, in particular to provide schools with 
resources for teacher training and professional development.

    Funding aside, the hyperlocal nature of this challenge 
demands a national movement to elevate the conversation about 
AI readiness, and I believe all of you sitting here today have 
the trust and influence at your disposal to champion this 
message, both here in Washington and at home.

    I want to close by underscoring that while educators are 
understandably concerned about the implications of AI on their 
jobs, at aiEDU, we firmly believe that teachers are critical to 
helping students build the skills they need to succeed.

    Put simply, our teachers are at the very heart of any 
solution to the future of work. Thank you, and I look forward 
to your questions.

    [The prepared statement of Mr. Kotran follows.]
                   prepared statement of alex kotran
    Good morning, Chairman Hickenlooper, Ranking Member Braun, and 
distinguished Members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity 
to testify today on the critical topic of artificial intelligence in 
education.

    I want to first applaud the Committee for its recent work advancing 
two bills--the Teachers LEAD Act of 2023 and the STEM Education in 
Accounting Act--which demonstrate a deep understanding, which I share, 
about the vital roles that teacher leadership and career exploration 
play in preparing students for the future. By supporting these 
initiatives, the Committee is taking important steps to enhance 
education quality and expand career opportunities, reflecting a strong 
commitment to strengthening our education system and workforce 
readiness.

    My name is Alex Kotran, and I am the CEO and founder of aiEDU, an 
organization dedicated to bringing AI expertise to classrooms 
nationwide. I have been deeply involved in the AI space since 2015. I 
co-founded aiEDU in 2019, well before the public introduction of large 
language models (LLMs). Our vision is to ensure that every student is 
ready for the age of artificial intelligence.

    Today, I appear before you to underscore the urgent need to 
massively expand investment in teacher training and professional 
development to ensure that our schools and educators have the capacity 
to prepare students for the profound changes and disruption that AI 
will bring to our society and economy.
                     The Reach and Impact of aiEDU
    I'd like to begin this testimony with a brief summary of aiEDU's 
work, as our experience is highly relevant to the topic being 
discussed. Founded in 2019, The AI Education Project is a national 
501c3 nonprofit organization that has been leading a national movement 
to advance AI Readiness and AI Literacy for all students through 
concerted efforts to build capacity with teachers and education 
systems.

    We define AI Literacy as the collection of skills and knowledge 
that a person needs to confidently understand, ethically use, and 
critically evaluate artificial intelligence in a world in which AI is 
becoming more and more ubiquitous.

    We define AI Readiness as being when students, teachers, and school 
systems have the ability and underlying skills to apply AI Literacy to 
professional and personal endeavors. A person is AI ready when they 
understand the interdisciplinary impacts of AI and how to apply their 
human advantage alongside evolving technology, to leverage 
collaboration, creativity, and self-advocacy alongside AI to achieve 
their life and career potential.

    At aiEDU we've built a sophisticated grassroots operation that 
reaches tens of thousands of educators, anchored in partnerships with 
some of the largest districts and education systems in the country. 
This includes: Prince George's County Public Schools, the State of Ohio 
(via a coalition that includes the Lt. Governor's office and Dept. of 
Education), the State of Colorado (via the Colorado Education 
Initiative), and the National Rural Education Association (which 
reaches 9M students). Collectively, our reach is now impacting hundreds 
of thousands of students and tens of thousands of teachers in every 
single state in the U.S.

    aiEDU has built a coalition of early adopters for AI Literacy in K-
12 that are now leading the country with demonstrated models of tiered 
support enabling delivery of AI curriculum and professional 
development. We make an impact mainly through curriculum 
implementations and teacher trainings that directly impact students. We 
have focused on the K-12 space because it is possible to create 
equitable reach for all students via established systems, and is a 
natural middle ground between government, nonprofits, and industry. 
And, of course, because student success is inherently non-partisan.

    We've developed a template in which aiEDU provides critical support 
to empower districts and non-profit groups: We supply the content, 
subject matter expertise, and training that empowers our partners to 
scale delivery of AI expertise and instructional support across their 
networks. Our focus on districts and large systems is also fundamental 
to our mission to reach all students, as we intentionally select 
regions with large populations of students who are at risk of otherwise 
being left behind.

    Our goal is to bring AI expertise to classrooms nationwide. 
Teachers and education leaders trust aiEDU because we don't build or 
sell AI products (of which there are now thousands). Instead, we help 
leaders close a critical gap that every major district or K-12 system 
in the country faces: Preparing teachers and students for the age of 
AI.

    Over the past year alone, our organization has made significant 
strides in promoting AI education. We've conducted more than 120 
events, including summits, workshops, and seminars, reaching more than 
10,000 educators and administrators. Our aiEDU tools and curriculum 
have been downloaded by over 1,350 educators, impacting 231,000 
students across all 50 states. We've launched major district programs 
in New York City and Prince George's County, expanded statewide 
initiatives in Ohio, Hawaii, and Colorado, and partnered with 
organizations serving rural and indigenous communities.
                The Critical Importance of AI Readiness 
    We stand at the dawn of a transformative era. The AI revolution 
will define the trajectory of an entire generation of students and 
fundamentally change the skills they need to compete in the workforce. 
The urgency of this challenge is hard to overstate.

    Early indications about the capabilities of large language models 
are startling and suggest that we are on the cusp of massive disruption 
to our workforce and social fabric in the coming decade. The pace of 
development is rapid, with a steady drumbeat of new models featuring 
increasingly massive training dataset along with powerful new AI 
graphical processing units (GPUs) that reflect the hundreds of billions 
of dollars of investment that has been pouring into the space.

        <bullet>  Earlier this month, OpenAI revealed its ``o1'' model 
        family, which are designed to employ complex reasoning through 
        a ``chain-of-thought'' process that, in short, has enabled 
        their newest LLM to exceed PhD-level accuracy on benchmarks of 
        physics, biology, and chemistry problems, as well as beat the 
        vast majority of humans at competitive programming and math 
        competitions.

    Less than 2 years ago, Generative AI was virtually non-existent for 
consumers. Today, it is widely accessible, rapidly evolving, and 
starting to demonstrate meaningful applications that could result in 
significant impacts on the future of work:

    Software Engineering: Last month Amazon CEO Andy Jassy shared that 
their AI assistant, Amazon Q, made eye-popping advances in replacing 
and augmenting the company's software engineers, with average time to 
upgrade an application to Java 17 dropping from 50 developer days to 
just a few hours. Jassy stated that this efficiency saved the company 
the equivalent of 4,500 years of developer work, and that nearly 80 
percent of AI-generated code reviews were finalized without any 
additional changes.

    Healthcare: There are myriad studies demonstrating LLM's ability to 
provide accurate diagnoses. A recent study by Google Research in 
collaboration with Google DeepMind revealed that an LLM developed with 
conversational and collaborative capabilities was able to improve 
diagnostic reasoning and accuracy by clinicians working on complex 
medical situations, with the performance of clinicians augmented with 
the LLM achieving 59.1 percent accuracy, compared with 33.6 percent of 
clinicians working unassisted.

    Entertainment: The rapid advances in generative AI and diffusion 
models, which enable text-to-image, text-to-speech, and text-to-video 
content synthesis, have rocked Hollywood and the entertainment 
industry, with a recent survey of 300 executives reporting that 75 
percent indicated AI tools will support the elimination, reduction, or 
consolidation of jobs at their companies. That same report estimates 
that 204,000 entertainment jobs will be affected by AI within the next 
3 years alone.

    Anecdotes aside, research into the potential impact of LLMs on the 
workforce suggest wide-ranging applications and displacement, 
concentrated in some of the most common knowledge work careers in the 
U.S.

    A study by OpenAI and the University of Pennsylvania investigating 
the labor market impacts of LLMs identified a number of occupations 
with significant exposure to AI-enabled automation of tasks, including: 
Financial Analysts, Writers and Authors, Web and Digital Interface 
Designers, Accountants and Auditors, Engineers, Clinical Data Managers, 
Legal Secretaries, Administrative Assistants, to name a few.

    Pew estimates that 19 percent of American workers are currently 
employed in jobs that are ``the most exposed to AI, in which most 
activities may be either replaced or assisted by AI.'' Researchers 
noted that ``jobs with a high level of exposure to AI tend to be in 
higher-paying fields where a college education and analytical skills 
can be a plus.''

    In the years ahead, industries that employ the majority of 
Americans will improve their AI implementations to increase 
productivity and efficiency. This will change the skills workers need 
in order to keep up, compete, and thrive. Workers will increasingly 
have help from AI assistants, powerful new tools, and back-end process 
automation that displaces routine tasks. Historically, automation 
doesn't happen gradually; since 1980, the vast majority of job loss in 
occupations hit by automation took place immediately following 
recessions. Given it has been 16 years since our last serious 
recession, we should anticipate acute impacts from AI on employment 
whenever we experience our next one.

    AI Readiness is important beyond preparing students to succeed in a 
changing world of work--AI is already having a profound, if under-
appreciated, impact on our kids' social lives in ways we might not have 
anticipated.

    Character.ai is now the third most popular AI tool, with millions 
of people spending multiple hours per day interacting with AI chatbots. 
This trend is deeply concerning at a time when we are dealing with an 
epidemic of loneliness, isolation, and depression among students. And 
we are yet to see the impacts that new voice-enabled products will have 
amid warnings from companies like OpenAI that anthropomorphism of AI 
could ``reduce [users] need for for human interaction--potentially 
benefiting lonely individuals but possibly affecting healthy 
relationships.''

    Natasha Singer at the New York Times has reported on the even more 
disturbing phenomenon of schools encountering instances of sexual abuse 
conducted via nudification apps, which enable teens to ``pervert real, 
identifiable photos of their clothed female classmates, shown attending 
events like school proms, into graphic, convincing-looking images of 
the girls with exposed A.I.-generated breasts and genitalia.''

    Michelle Culver, the founder of The Rithim Project, a nonprofit 
working to advance human connection for young people, recently outlined 
the table stakes: ``In 2021, 22 percent of high schoolers reported that 
they had considered suicide; 4 in 10 said they experienced persistent 
feelings of sadness or hopelessness. . . only 27 percent of American 
men have at least six close friends; 30 years ago, that figure was more 
than twice as high. Some 15 percent report having none at all. Across 
the board, the trend lines are going in the wrong direction.''

    Preventing students from eschewing human relationships in favor of 
AI chatbots that will never reject them or make them feel awkward is 
likely as difficult as banning social media or gaming, which is to say, 
impossible. Likewise, deepfake tools are often run by shell companies 
with servers in opaque jurisdictions overseas that are difficult or 
impossible to block. Educators are therefore a critical component of 
any strategy to build emotional resilience, social skills, and 
knowledge that students will need when navigating the increasingly 
complex digital world.

    Given these rapid changes, AI Literacy will be critical to building 
resilience and awareness among students. We've seen the impact of 
social media on society, and we must learn from those experiences as we 
navigate the AI revolution.
  Building Capacity for AI Readiness Centers on Teacher Training and 
                        Professional Development

    What our organization has learned in over 5 years of working with 
students across the country is that there is no one-size-fits-all 
approach to scaling AI readiness. However, building increased system 
capacity is key for all schools.

    We need to work state by state and, in some cases, district by 
district, to create models that scale, ensuring all students, teachers, 
and school systems have access to quality AI curriculum and are 
prepared for what's ahead.

    In Ohio, for example, aiEDU has built a partnership with the 
Department of Education and Workforce, the Governor's office, and 
hundreds of schools across the state in collaboration with educational 
service centers. This approach has allowed us to raise system capacity 
across the state in a way that makes sense for Ohio's specific needs.

    Given the stakes, it is also all the more critical that we work to 
build capacity in even the most hard-to-reach communities.

    aiEDU has leveraged partnerships with community-based organizations 
that work across state lines, including Indigitize, which is partnering 
with our organization to build capacity with indigenous students, and 
the National Rural Education Association to reach students in rural 
settings.

    At the center of our approach to build capacity, and reach all 
students is teacher training and professional development. It is clear 
from our efforts and from our quantitative and qualitative research 
that teachers and administrators want--and need--support and access to 
professional development on AI.

    While large language models are still maturing and may not yet be 
suitable for scaled implementation at the district level, systems can 
start by focusing on building AI literacy. This lays critical 
foundational groundwork that is essential to any successful 
implementation of AI tools or the policies that enable their safe and 
responsible use.

    Our own research underscores the urgency of this need. The current 
and future workforce implications are significant given that about 13 
percent of the American workforce works in public elementary and 
secondary school. In a survey of thousands of teachers, we found that 
an overwhelming majority--more than 72 percent--said they were only 
moderately comfortable with AI tools. For our Country to build the base 
of new skills we need and to prepare our students, teachers and 
administrators adequately for what is ahead, this number must change 
dramatically.
                       Focusing on Durable Skills
    The goal of our education system must include an expanded focus on 
durable skills that will be critical to enabling people to augment AI 
tools that are certain to become increasingly commonplace in the 
workplace. These skills--critical thinking, communication, 
collaboration, computational thinking, resilience, adaptability, and 
digital citizenship--are best developed through live, engaging 
classroom activities facilitated by educators.

    In order to cultivate AI Literacy and build AI Readiness that will 
serve a generation of workers defined by AI technology, we believe that 
a range of AI competencies must be widely understood and achieved in 
our education system.

    First, students must know the basics of AI--knowing what AI is, how 
to use it, understanding how AI works along with its foundations in 
computing, and perhaps most important to be continuously curious about 
AI.

    Second, when they know the basics, students must be able to think 
critically with AI--spotting and questioning bias, examining AI's use, 
and being continuously curious about AI's influence their lives, 
careers, and society. In practice, that will mean things like 
identifying why outputs from AI tools have discrepancies (e.g., values 
and bias in creating data sets), critiquing AI systems for embedded 
biases and propose ways to make them more inclusive and ethical, and 
critically assessing AI outputs, considering potential biases and 
limitations.

    Thirdly, a critical component for students and the workforce in an 
era defined by new technology to know and truly understand your human 
advantage. We must ensure that students are innovative and persistent 
in their pursuit of solutions, are able to synthesize interdisciplinary 
and AI knowledge to solve problems in a holistic way, and to leverage 
their own ability to collaborate and self advocate when they navigate 
their careers.

    There are opportunities to connect durable skills and AI Readiness 
together--and it's important to make these connections accessible and 
to motivate educators to work with them. A growing number of teachers 
in our research--54 percent--recognize AI literacy as an important or 
essential skill for their students future. But fewer do so than other 
important life skills for students such as social emotional skills (92 
percent) critical thinking and problem solving (95 percent) career 
exploration (88 percent) and digital citizenship and media literacy (75 
percent).
                            Recommendations

    We urgently need coordinated and concerted efforts at the national, 
state, regional, and local levels to elevate conversation and action 
around skills and training for both teachers and students. While there 
isn't a clear policy or approach at the Federal level alone which could 
address this challenge, Congress can nonetheless create the conditions 
by elevating the conversation and routing more funds and support for 
states and districts to make the necessary investments.

    We support several key policy changes:

        1. Establishment of Federal AI standards to provide common 
        benchmarks for AI literacy and implementation in education.

        2. Development of aligned data standards to enable centralized 
        tracking of progress in AI education.

        3. Increased investment and support for upskilling educators in 
        AI technologies and pedagogies.

    It's crucial to note that while educators are understandably 
concerned about the implications of AI on their jobs, we firmly believe 
that teachers are critical to helping students build the skills 
required to succeed in an AI-driven world. Teachers must never be 
displaced by automated tools. This stands in contrast to the rhetoric 
coming from some in the tech community who envision a world where our 
education system is centered on ubiquitous AI tutors.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Mr. Kotran. Finally, we 
have Mr. Denzel Wilson. Mr. Wilson serves as the Grassroots 
Community Manager for Seed AI, where he leads efforts to 
facilitate community based AI literacy training through a 
coalition of corporate and higher education partners. Mr. 
Wilson.

 STATEMENT OF DENZEL WILSON, GRASSROOTS PROGRAM MANAGER, SEED 
                       AI, WASHINGTON, DC

    Mr. Wilson. Thank you, Chairman Hickenlooper, Ranking 
Member Braun, and Members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for 
inviting me to testify today. My name is Denzel Wilson, and I 
am the Grassroots Program Manager for Seed AI.

    I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this 
critically important topic of preparing the American workforce 
for AI. Seed AI is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization 
working at the forefront of AI policy and governance.

    We work with policymakers, scientists, academics, and the 
private sector to design policies, programs, and tools to 
ensure AI benefits all Americans. Today's topic is a personal 
one for me because I grew up in Kankakee, Illinois, a county 
right outside of Chicago, where opportunities were scarce, and 
career options were limited.

    After graduating high school, I faced several obstacles, 
including being laid off during the COVID-19 pandemic. That led 
me on an unexpected path. This setback sparked a pivotal career 
change. So in the fall of 2020, I decided to pursue my interest 
in AI by joining the AI program at Houston Community College.

    My efforts culminated in becoming the first graduate of HCC 
associate's in Applied AI degree, a first not just for the 
college but for the entire State of Texas. This experience 
paved the way for my current role in Seed AI, which I joined in 
2023.

    Our goal with grassroots work at Seed AI is to turn anxiety 
and intrigue and turn that intrigue into opportunity. This work 
has revealed key lessons that can help prepare the American 
workforce for AI.

    First, students from community colleges, Historically Black 
Colleges and Universities, and other underrepresented 
demographics are hungry and capable of harnessing the power of 
AI as their advantage. And second, when presented with new 
perspectives and opportunities, students from these 
demographics thrive in environments that require 
resourcefulness and creativity.

    We do this in several ways, including running our Hack the 
Future Initiative to inspire and educate participants about the 
potential of AI. These events have collectively reached 
hundreds of students, providing them with hands on experience 
and valuable insights to the world of technology and 
innovation.

    Seed AI also helped conceive and organize the largest ever 
generative AI red team at the Hack Convention DEFCON in 2023. 
This featured over 2,000 participants, including 220 students 
and entrepreneurs from Tulsa, HBCUs, and community colleges 
flown in by Seed AI and our partners.

    This unprecedented event demonstrated that there is a 
pathway for people from all walks of life to participate in 
shaping AI. Seed AI has also implemented a robust micro grant 
program to fill gaps we saw in the AI skill landscape.

    By the end of 2024, Seed AI will distribute over 90,000 
micro grants across nine community colleges and universities, 
directly investing in the future of AI education, and ensuring 
that a diverse range of students can participate in and 
contribute to the AI revolution. Lowering the barriers to 
acquiring AI skills is just one piece of the puzzle.

    Skills alone will only go so far. We need to invest in 
creating the infrastructure that all who wish to can access 
computational and data reader sources necessary to meaningfully 
engage and co-create with AI.

    We believe community colleges are uniquely equipped to 
create opportunities for people that are capable of succeeding 
as scientists and engineers, but do not have access to pathways 
that lead into those careers. What the NSF calls the missing 
millions.

    This is why Seed AI is proud to partner with the NSF funded 
National Applied Artificial Intelligence Consortium, an 
initiative launched by three community colleges, all of which 
were awarded micro grants from Seed AI in 2024.

    Applied AI skills are the key to unlocking the benefits of 
fundamental AI advancements, as well as well-paying jobs and 
sustainable careers for all Americans. Seed AI is also proud to 
participate in the Tulsa hub for Equitable and Trustworthy 
Autonomy, which was recently awarded $51 million by the U.S. 
Economic Development Administration.

    We view partnerships like the Tulsa Hub and the National 
Applied AI Consortium as critical last mile components of 
things like the National AI Research Resource. These 
partnerships address the critical need to ensure that the 
research from the NAIR can be co-developed and leveraged by 
communities across the country.

    There is both incredible appetite and untapped potential in 
American workers and students nationwide to participate in and 
benefit from AI. Seed AI is eager to work with Members of this 
Subcommittee to help realize the vision of preparing the 
American workforce for AI and leverage the lessons we have 
learned from our grassroots work.

    There are several key opportunities we think would help 
make this happen as fast and as equitably as possible that I 
would be happy to discuss today. Most importantly, we encourage 
the Subcommittee to leverage its power of attention.

    Progress on this topic requires robust public-private 
partnerships and tapping all stakeholders in the Government, 
industry, and academia to make changes to facilitate greater 
participation in and access to AI opportunities.

    We can transform the AI ecosystem to one that is more 
inclusive and participatory, more geographically diverse, and 
more beneficial for all Americans. Thank you to Chairman 
Hickenlooper, Ranking Member Braun, and Members of the 
Subcommittee. I look forward to answering your questions.

    [The prepared statement of Mr. Wilson follows.]
                  prepared statement of denzel wilson
    Chairman Hickenlooper and Ranking Member Braun.

    Thank you for inviting me to testify today before the Subcommittee. 
My name is Dezel Wilson, and I am the Grassroots Program Manager for 
SeedAI. I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this critically 
important topic of preparing the American workforce for AI.

    SeedAI is a non-partisan, non-profit organization that works at the 
forefront of artificial intelligence policy and governance, 
collaborating with policymakers, scientists, academics, and the private 
sector to design policies, programs, and tools to ensure AI benefits 
all Americans.

    Ensuring that AI benefits Americans does not just mean that 
Americans can access the latest technologies. It means giving Americans 
the tools to participate in the development of AI, to harness the 
potential of AI for their empowerment, to democratize access to the 
skills necessary to make AI work for them, and to expand economic 
opportunities for new students and existing members of the workforce 
alike.

    This topic is a personal one for me. I grew up in Kankakee, IL, a 
county outside of Chicago, where opportunities were scarce and career 
options were limited. Outside of football, technology was my passion 
growing up. Over the years, I witnessed firsthand how the steady 
evolution of technology was transforming the world around me and how 
the rise of AI has created so many unanswered questions in our world 
today. I am grateful to be a part of what some call the ``Fourth 
Industrial Revolution,'' working to tap into our human instinct for 
innovation to ensure we create the necessary infrastructure, 
partnerships, and policies so that AI serves the needs of the many, not 
just the few.

    I'd like to highlight three things in my testimony today:

        1. How my personal journey illustrates what is possible when we 
        prioritize expanding access to the tools necessary to prepare 
        students and workers for AI

        2. SeedAI's grassroots work provide AI skills to students 
        across the country

        3. How SeedAI is working to ensure all Americans can benefit 
        from AI
                             1. My Journey
    I always harbored a deep passion for technology and sports. 
However, after graduating high school, I faced several obstacles that 
led me on an unexpected path. Eventually, I found myself in Houston, 
Texas, working in the oil and gas industry. When COVID-19 hit, I was 
laid off, but this setback sparked a pivotal career change. In the fall 
of 2020, I decided to pursue my interest in artificial intelligence by 
joining the AI program at Houston Community College (HCC).

    While at HCC, I immersed myself in the field by joining the 
Computer Science Association to find community during the pandemic. My 
dedication was recognized when I received the Pepsico Uplift 
Scholarship and was named President of the Computer Science Association 
club. Driven by a desire to create opportunities for others, I worked 
with a group of hungry students and faculty to initiate the HCC AI & 
The Future Conference, which has since evolved into the Gulf Coast 
Conference on Artificial Intelligence. My efforts culminated in 
becoming the first graduate of HCC's Associates in Applied AI Degree--a 
first not just for the college but for the entire state of Texas.

    This achievement, winning the Intel Global AI Festival National 
competition, and presenting the project to Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, 
paved the way for my current role at SeedAI, which I joined in 2023.
                     2. Grassroots Work with SeedAI
    My grassroots work at SeedAI has revealed key lessons about how we 
should think about better preparing the American workforce for AI. 
First, students from community colleges, Historically Black Colleges 
and Universities (HBCUs), and other underrepresented demographics are 
hungry and capable of harnessing the power of AI to their advantage. 
Second, when presented with new perspectives and opportunities, 
students from these demographics thrive in environments that require 
resourcefulness and creativity.

    Enabling greater participation in AI means more than just making 
the technology perform more effectively for diverse populations. It 
means ensuring that the trajectory of the technology bends toward the 
needs of the many, not the few, and that all Americans can have a hand 
in shaping the future of AI.
                            Hack the Future 
    Hack The Future (HTF), a flagship initiative of SeedAI has made 
significant strides in engaging students and technology enthusiasts 
across the Nation. To date, we have successfully hosted nine Hack The 
Future events, each designed to inspire and educate participants about 
the potential of AI and emerging technologies. These events have 
collectively reached over 250 students, providing them with hands-on 
experience and valuable insights into the world of technology and 
innovation.

    Our impact extends beyond traditional educational settings. At 
DEFCON 31, the world's largest hacker convention, our HTF event engaged 
over 2,200 users, showcasing the broad appeal and relevance of our 
program. We've also organized specialized events such as Hack The 
Future: Greenwood, in collaboration with Black Tech Street and the 
White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Hack The 
Future @ SXSW 2024, where we facilitated the participation of 47 
students from Houston Community College, the University of Houston, and 
Texas Southern University. Other notable events include Hack The Future 
Cleveland, which partnered with Case Western University and JOLTI Law 
Journal, and Hack The Future: Atlanta, collaborating with the Dream 
Machine. Looking ahead, we're excited to announce our tenth event, 
scheduled for October 11 in Houston, continuing our mission to 
democratize access to AI education and opportunities.
                         Public AI Red-Teaming 
    Red-teaming has been a key tool in security research for decades 
and typically requires specialized skillsets. \1\ But this does not 
have to be the case with AI. With large language models, where the 
interface is typically plain language, the barriers to participating in 
red-teaming are dramatically lower. And when it comes to identifying 
shortcomings in model performance, the larger and more diverse cohort 
red-teaming a model, the better.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\  https://cset.georgetown.edu/article/what-does-ai-red-teaming-
actually-mean/.

    SeedAI saw this as an opportunity to pilot the idea that modern AI 
opens up opportunities for broad, diverse, and relatively unskilled 
folks. In early 2023, SeedAI began working with cybersecurity and AI 
experts at Humane Intelligence, the AI Village, the White House Office 
of Science and Technology Policy, the National Science Foundation, and 
the congressional AI Caucus to set our sights on an ambitious, large-
scale public red-teaming event at the AI Village at DEF CON 31. \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\  https://www.hackthefuture.com/news/ai-village-at-def-con-
announces-largest-ever-public-generative-ai-red-team.

    As something like this had never been done before, SeedAI got to 
work to design what a public AI red team would actually look like in 
practice. SeedAI held the first pilot of a competitive AI red-team with 
Houston Community College students at South by Southwest in March 2023. 
\3\ SeedAI then hosted a second pilot at Howard University in June to 
teach Howard students how to expose bias, potential harms, and security 
vulnerabilities in generative AI models. \4\ With DEF CON scheduled for 
just a few weeks away in August, SeedAI and our partners secured the 
participation of Anthropic, Cohere, Google, Hugging Face, NVIDIA, 
OpenAI, and Stability to provide model access to red-team participants.

    \4\  https://www.hackthefuture.com/news/hack-the-future-at-howard-
university.

    With all of the major AI players involved, the AI red-team at DEF 
CON ended up being the largest ever generative AI red-team (public or 
private) by an order of magnitude with 2,244 participants. \5\ SeedAI 
and community partners Black Tech Street and Houston Community College 
also brought 220 students and entrepreneurs from Tulsa, HBCUs, and 
community colleges to DEF CON to join in. Our goal was to ensure that 
the exercise would create a pathway for people from all walks of life 
to participate in shaping AI while demonstrating that including more 
diverse perspectives in red-teaming makes AI more resilient, reliable, 
and trustworthy for all Americans.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\  https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2023/05/04/biden-
white-house-backs-biggest-ai-hacking-event-with-google-and-chatgpt/.

    The lessons learned from the DEF CON AI red-team highlight that 
public red-teaming--while not replacing the need for robust internal 
testing and evaluation practice--is a valuable addition to the broader 
AI safety landscape and can shine greater light on harms related to 
demographics and lived experiences. \6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0Rc-/view.

    While red-teaming is a natural entry point for greater 
participation in AI, policymakers, industry, academia, and civil 
society should seek to lower barriers to public participation in AI 
through as many domains as possible.
               Microgrants for Direct Student Empowerment
    As part of our mission to democratize access to artificial 
intelligence education and opportunities, SeedAI has implemented a 
robust microgrant pilot program to fill gaps we saw in the AI skills 
landscape. This initiative explicitly targets students and clubs at 
community colleges, HBCUs, and other minority-serving institutions 
across the United States. The program aims to provide crucial financial 
support to those who might otherwise lack access to resources in the 
rapidly evolving field of AI.

    In a significant step toward realizing this goal, SeedAI forged 
formal partnerships with nine community colleges and universities. 
These partnerships create pathways for students to access a wealth of 
opportunities and resources in the AI domain. To date, SeedAI has 
distributed over $90,000 in microgrants across nine educational 
institutions, directly investing in the future of AI education and 
ensuring that a diverse range of students can participate in and 
contribute to the AI revolution.

    The goal of these microgrants is to pilot a new model for lifting 
up students by lowering barriers to accessing AI skills. We are 
incredibly proud of this work, but we recognize that this is not a long 
term solution to addressing the needs of students across the country--
to ensure we can reach as many people as effectively as possible, we 
are shifting our efforts to support national consortia. As we work with 
other groups and initiatives to scale our impact, we will continue to 
iterate on and prioritize the microgrants program and bring the lessons 
we learn to inform and work on the national stage.
                 3. Ensuring AI Benefits All Americans
    SeedAI works to ensure that everyone across the geographic and 
economic spectrum--not just a select few--can influence and benefit 
from transformative AI technologies. We believe that this will lead to 
a fairer society, better AI policy, and a more robust and diverse 
workforce, enabling the United States to maintain its leadership 
position in driving technological innovation.

    Expanding access to AI opportunities and preparing the American 
workforce for AI will be critical to America's AI competitiveness 
overall. Currently, the AI talent is concentrated in a handful of 
companies primarily located in Silicon Valley, and many talented 
researchers, workers, and entrepreneurs do not have access to the basic 
infrastructure and resources they need to develop and test their ideas 
and apply AI in their careers.
                             Infrastructure
    Lowering the barriers to acquiring AI skills is just one piece of 
this puzzle--skills alone will only go far. We need to invest in 
creating the infrastructure so that all who wish to can access the 
computational and data resources, testbeds, software, and tools 
necessary to meaningfully engage and co-create with AI. This 
infrastructure is what will enable us to move beyond just providing 
workers with access to AI to actually democratizing participation in 
shaping the technology.

    To that end, SeedAI has strongly supported the creation and 
complete funding of the National AI Research Resource (NAIRR). The 
NAIRR pilot, launched in January 2024, is a proof-of-concept for the 
eventual full-scale NAIRR, which will create national infrastructure to 
connect U.S. researchers with the compute, data, and tools necessary to 
conduct valuable AI research. The NAIRR pilot is led by the National 
Science Foundation in partnership with 12 other Federal agencies and 26 
non-governmental partners--an excellent example of the kind of public-
private partnerships we desperately need to create the robust public 
infrastructure necessary for large-scale participation in AI.

    Research from the NAIRR can be a powerful foundation of technology 
that can be applied and tested by people around the country. However 
the NAIRR itself is not yet fully funded. The bipartisan CREATE AI Act 
would formally authorize the creation of the NAIRR, which is a critical 
first step. \7\ To be fully effective, The NAIRR Task Force estimated 
that the NAIRR will require $2.6 billion over a 6-year period. \8\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        The National Applied Artificial Intelligence Consortium
    In 2021, NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan laid out a vision for 
the future of science in the U.S. that tapped into the ``missing 
millions''--people who are capable of succeeding as scientists and 
engineers but do not have access to pathways that lead into those 
careers. \9\ We believe community colleges are the key to unlocking 
these pathways.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\  https://www.aaas.org/news/nsf-director-lays-out-vision-future-
us-science.

    This is why SeedAI is proud to partner with the National Applied 
Artificial Intelligence Consortium (NAAIC), an initiative launched by 
Miami Dade College (MDC) in partnership with Houston Community College 
(HCC) and Maricopa County Community College District (MCCCD). The 
Consortium's mission is closely aligned with SeedAI's goals of ensuring 
broad participation in AI development and governance by building local 
AI hubs and engaging diverse communities. The founding schools all 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
received microgrants from SeedAI in 2024.

    The Consortium is a game-changer, not just for community colleges, 
but for the entire AI-driven economy. Applied AI skills are the key to 
unlocking the benefits of fundamental AI advancements, as well as well-
paying jobs and sustainable careers for all Americans. We can have all 
the AI research in the world, but it doesn't make a difference if we 
don't have communities prepared to apply the technologies to the 
benefit of everyday Americans.
             Tulsa Hub for Equitable & Trustworthy Autonomy
    To that end, SeedAI is proud to support the Tulsa Hub for Equitable 
& Trustworthy Autonomy (THETA), which was recently awarded $51m by the 
U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA). \10\ SeedAI will work 
with Black Tech Street to provide strategic guidance and capacity 
building for the AI/AS Program for Innovation, Research, and Education 
(ASPIRE) initiative. This includes procuring high-performance computing 
resources and organizing underlying projects for community benefit.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \10\  https://www.eda.gov/funding/programs/regional-technology-and-
innovation-hubs/2023/Tulsa-Hub-for-Equitable-Trustworthy-Autonomy.

    We view partnerships like the Tulsa Hub and the NAAIC as critical 
``last-mile'' components of the NAIRR. These partnerships address the 
critical need to ensure that research from the NAIRR can be co-
developed and leveraged by communities across the country.
              Legislation to Increase Participation in AI
    SeedAI also supports bipartisan legislation like the Expanding AI 
Voices Act, which aims to diversify AI research and workforce 
development. \11\ This bill would support capacity-building in Minority 
Serving Institutions (MSIs), HBCUs, and Tribal Colleges. By expanding 
the National Science Foundation (NSF)'s ExpandAI program, the act 
ensures that the future of AI is inclusive and representative of all 
communities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \11\  https://www.Congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/9403/
text/ih.

    Another is the bipartisan Workforce for AI Trust Act, which aims to 
develop a multidisciplinary workforce that can advance the creation and 
deployment of safe, fair, and transparent artificial intelligence 
systems. \12\ These proposals can leverage the lessons from work like 
ours for the broad benefit of Americans.

                               Conclusion
    There is both incredible appetite and untapped potential in 
American workers and students across the country to participate in and 
benefit from AI. SeedAI is eager to work with Members of this 
Subcommittee to help realize the vision of preparing the American 
workforce for AI and leverage the lessons we've learned from working 
with students across the country. There are several key opportunities 
we think would help make this happen as fast and as equitably as 
possible.

    First, we are eager to continue expanding our Hack the Future 
program to serve communities in your states and across the country. 
Please don't hesitate to reach out if that's of interest.

    Second, we strongly support passage of the CREATE AI Act to 
authorize the NAIRR, and support its full funding of $2.6 billion a 
year for 6 years. We also support passage of the bipartisan Expanding 
AI Voices Act and the Workforce for AI Trust Act. The development and 
application of AI is an ecosystem, and we need to support each critical 
component.

    Third, as one of the first graduates with an Associates Degree in 
Applied AI, I encourage Members of the Subcommittee to explore 
opportunities to eliminate counterproductive education requirements for 
entry level jobs related to AI. Skills are what matter, and creating 
programs to cultivate these skills in the American workforce only go so 
far when many jobs require 4-year degrees that prevent qualified 
workers from accessing these opportunities.

    Fourth, most importantly, we encourage the Subcommittee to leverage 
its power of attention. Progress on this topic requires robust public 
private partnerships and tapping all stakeholders in the government, 
industry, and academia to make changes to facilitate greater 
participation in and access to AI opportunities.

    By promoting these opportunities where they exist, incentivizing 
their creation, and providing them with the resources and 
infrastructure they need to be successful, we can transform the AI 
ecosystem to be one that is more inclusive and participatory, more 
geographically diverse, and more beneficial for all Americans.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Terrific. Thank you, Mr. Wilson. Let 
me start the questioning--am I missing anything? I always look 
to the Ranking Member because he really actually understands 
politics at much--at a deeper level than I do. When I am in 
trouble, he kicks me under the desk, or nudges, I should say.

    Anyway, Mr. Kotran, aiEDU is launching AI literacy 
initiatives across the country including a recently launched 
partnership in Colorado. How do you work with local leaders and 
employers to help customize the training resources and ensure 
that they are responsive to local or regional training needs?

    Mr. Kotran. Yes, thanks for the question. So our work is 
really different state to state. Colorado is an example of a 
state where we have actually found the opportunity to push 
forward a statewide initiative.

    In Colorado, we have worked with an organization called the 
Colorado Education Initiative, which actually aiEDU worked 
directly with school districts and spun out into an independent 
nonprofit. And we have essentially plugged in as a subject 
matter expert for CEI. CEI over the past year has convened 
hundreds of stakeholders across the education system, the 
workforce, and the political community.

    This is really top down advocacy work to really create the 
demand and the awareness for not just the goalposts, which are 
how do we make sure that teachers are trained, and students are 
ready, but also creating awareness about what are the systemic 
components that have to be in place, which ultimately comes 
down to training and building capacity with teachers.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Got it. Thank you. Mr. Wilson, as we 
undergo this new technological revolution, we want to make sure 
that workers aren't left behind.

    How do you think the Federal Government can best position 
training resources to make sure that they reach traditionally 
underserved workers, including those in rural communities, 
those who might speak different languages, those completely 
outside the technology industry?

    Mr. Wilson. Thank you for that question, Chairman. I look 
at it from the perspective of--I am looking at it from 
community college perspective. I think community colleges 
across the country are the most representative of communities 
and constituencies.

    I think if we put focus on those 2 year programs and 
actually doing workforce related programs and putting funding 
toward those programs, it more so prepares students to be ready 
to work right after they get that 2 year degree instead of the 
traditional, you transfer from a 2-year and go to a 4-year and 
then try to get a career.

    A lot of students at the community college level are 
actually equipped. And if there is just more funding put toward 
that, I think it would be very beneficial for students coming 
with a 2-year degree to get into the workforce.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Great. Thank you. Mr. Meyer, as some 
employers have been experimenting with AI applications, we have 
seen that creating opportunities for workers to provide 
feedback is important.

    What steps are you taking, or should others be taking, to 
collect feedback from workers about their experiences as they 
interact with these AI applications? And how would that 
feedback impact your efforts going forward?

    Mr. Meyer. Thank you very much for the question, Senator 
Hickenlooper. First of all, employers, as they are doing, as 
most of them are doing right now, need to have their open door 
policies for their employees to come in and their workers to 
come in to tell them like, this is what my experience has been 
in this because we are going to--because employers then should 
take that feedback and use it to improve the employee 
experience.

    Because just from a personal standpoint, as far as I see, 
the biggest value for AI is for people and organizations to 
focus on what is really important. Yes, WRI, what is really 
important.

    Whatever your what is really important is or whatever 
organization you are at, using AI and having people who can use 
it will give them, give those individuals the time, the 
organizations, the time to focus on their WRI, what is really 
important.

    You are never going to know what is really important unless 
you are speaking to your people.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Great. Thank you. Dr. Kimbrough, we 
know that AI has the potential to impact workers across all 
industries, all levels of experience. What are some of the most 
in-demand technical and non-technical AI skills being sought 
out by employers?

    Does LinkedIn's data mirror training participation for 
those skill sets or those workers across industries? Are they 
seeking out such training opportunities and are there perhaps 
some industries that are more engaged in training than others? 
I will say it nicely.

    Dr. Kimbrough. Thank you, Chair Hickenlooper. I would say 
that in terms of the most in-demand skills that we see both for 
like technical talent and non-technical talent, starting with 
technical, it is very clearly things like generative AI, 
machine learning, generative neural networks, things like that 
are highly technical, and these are used by engineers who are 
forming and building these models and training them.

    The non-technical AI skills for the average person who 
wants to build their literacy is more around use of tools in 
the workplace or at home. It could be things like Copilot or 
ChatGPT. So just basic applications. But if you go broadly and 
say, what is LinkedIn doing? I think that was another part of 
your question, is how do we think about what we see in our 
data.

    There are industries that are adopting it more quickly than 
others. We do see industries such as retail, administrative and 
social--sorry, administrative services. And also I would say 
actually things--think about things like even in hotels, 
accommodation, restaurants, they are all starting to adopt 
generative AI tools.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Interesting. All right, I am going to 
turn it over at my 5 minutes, but I will be back. We get to 
have second rounds, I suspect.

    Senator Braun.

    Senator Braun. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Meyer, when I 
look at technology as it came on the scene decades ago, it 
scared certain generations. The ones that grew up with it 
seemed to embrace it, and it was like a second language or 
second nature.

    When you compare that to AI currently, talk a little bit 
about the generational difference. In other words, kids that 
have grown up with technology, do they view AI as just a new 
horizon? And for the folks who didn't grow up with it, how do 
you explain this to them?

    Mr. Meyer. You are right, it is--some of this stuff can be, 
in fact, really scary. I am just thinking about when my mom had 
to use a computer for the first time when she was working in 
health care.

    Because that is how I got my job in health care, just like 
a lot of people do. Their mother or father worked in health 
care and that is where you wound up. But I have to tell you, I 
think people are excited about this technology.

    Something to think about, the most amazing thing about AI 
is that we look at it today and this is the worst it is ever 
going to be. It is only going to get better from here, and it 
is only going to get more advanced from here.

    When we are looking at it now, in like three or 5 years 
down the road, it could be completely different, but you are 
right. We have been dealing with multigenerational workforces 
in HR for the last two decades, and this is certainly something 
that we are going to have to focus on to alleviate people's--
alleviate people's anxiety when it comes to AI for those who 
may not be as tech savvy.

    But also on the flip side of that, it is also a great 
reverse mentorship opportunity for organizations where you have 
younger generations in the workforce actually mentoring older 
generations of the workforce. It is actually pretty cool to 
think about stuff like that going on.

    That is something where we at SHRM and my colleagues who 
are in the HR profession, we have been dealing with this for 
the last--like I said, definitely for the last two decades. And 
a lot of us are looking forward to the opportunity.

    Senator Braun. Thank you. Mr. Wilson, would you want to 
weigh in on that as well, and with emphasis especially on the 
generation that is still trying to learn technology--has been 
thrown in their lap. They didn't grow up with it.

    Mr. Wilson. Yes, a great question, Senator. From my 
perspective, I grew up in the generation with technology, 
obviously. So this isn't really a new phenomenon. We grew up 
watching many robotic movies and AI taking over the world, so 
it is kind of something we have been primed for.

    Whereas my parents and my uncle's generation, they kind of 
were more uneasy about it. And I think that is where the AI 
anxiety portion that I talked about previously comes in because 
we know there is a lot of anxiety around what the possibilities 
AI are.

    I think it is important that both parties, all age groups, 
all generations get a clear understanding and foundational 
knowledge of how AI can be beneficial, but also the risks. And 
I think just with the older generation, we have to push that 
message a little more just because it is something they are not 
used to.

    But I do think that message needs to be consistent so we 
can get to the injury portion where people aren't so afraid of 
what AI can do.

    Senator Braun. Thank you. Dr. Kimbrough, recently, we have 
seen some states, localities attempt to implement policy in the 
AI space. New York City enacted a law regulating employers use 
of automated employment decision tools in hiring and 
promotions, requiring employers to audit their HR Technology 
systems for bias and publish their results.

    In California, the Governor signed an Executive Order 
directing state agencies to adopt a proactive approach to AI 
regulation, and to leverage the state's procurement power to 
promote so-called trustworthy AI principles.

    Are we at the point where we know what trustworthy AI 
principles are? And based upon what you have seen early out of 
the gate, what do you think of actions like we have seen here 
in New York and California?

    Dr. Kimbrough. Thank you, Ranking Member Braun. Well, I 
would say from my perspective as an economist at LinkedIn, I 
think we are all searching to commit ourselves to an area where 
we have the most responsible AI principles. At LinkedIn, this 
is exactly how we operate.

    We seek, for example--what I can speak to, we seek to put 
our members first. So, where we can uphold trust, where we can 
promote fairness and inclusion, where we can be extremely 
transparent, those are the kinds of principles that we adhere 
to in our own work at LinkedIn, to put members first and kind 
of create this vision of inclusion.

    I think it also empowers people when they understand how it 
is being used. They feel more empowered and there is more trust 
there. Thank you.

    Senator Braun. Thank you. And Mr. Kotran, so much of this 
arena is a competition with other places that will find a way 
to use it more productively, or on the other side of the 
spectrum, maybe come at you with it from a less wholesome point 
of view. What do you worry about?

    How do you see kind of the way we handle it vis-a-vis what 
other countries are doing, and you can see where they would 
want to probably be on the leading edge of it ideally to make 
their economies more productive.

    Or do you fear that this will be something we are going to 
battle similar to what we do with the malfeasance that we have 
got in our own technological world where you have got folks out 
using it with ransomware and other ways where they would use it 
as a negative tool. Where do you see AI on that kind of a pivot 
point of good versus evil?

    Mr. Kotran. Yes, I think I mean, you mentioned----

    Senator Braun. I saved the best question, I think, for you, 
Okay.

    [Laughter.]

    Mr. Kotran. Thank you, Senator. Look, there is a lot of 
examples of bad ways that bad actors can use AI. I think, when 
I look at what other countries are doing relative to the U.S., 
I am concerned about the fact that we are really on the back 
foot in terms of being ready for the economic displacement that 
is going to come from these tools.

    Like make no mistake, AI may not be coming for teachers 
jobs. It is coming for doctors, lawyers, designers, 
mathematicians, engineers, data scientists, paralegals, 
assistants, customer service managers, marketing managers, 
advertising managers. These are all careers that the University 
of Pennsylvania identified as being nearly fully exposed to 
large language models over the next 5 years.

    Again, this is not necessarily going to happen gradually 
and comfortably. It is going to happen all at once. If you are 
a company with $5 billion--$5 billion in revenues, your 
revenues are down--your profits are down $1 billion in the 
middle of a recession and your margin is 20 percent.

    You can increase sales by $5 billion, or you can cut costs 
by a billion. Companies are going to cut costs. They are going 
to use these tools to make up the difference as they lay off 
workers. And what I am concerned about is the fact that in the 
U.S. we do not have a plan to make sure that we are talking not 
just to the current workers, because that is a huge issue, but 
also to students who are making big decisions about what career 
path do they go.

    Which college career do I invest in? Should I spend 
$200,000 to go and get a law degree or a computer science 
degree? And you have the smartest experts in the field saying 
those jobs are going away. And at the same time, that 
conversation is happening in places like this in Silicon 
Valley. It is not happening in schools, and that is really 
concerning to me.

    Senator Braun. Thank you.

    Senator Hickenlooper. I think one of those vulnerable jobs 
might be that of a U.S. Senator. You never know.

    Senator Kaine.

    Senator Kaine. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thanks to the 
witnesses. So, if I am a 30 year old Virginian watching this, I 
would--wow, I should become AI literate. I should improve my 
employability and future career by gathering skills. But it is 
not just about getting skills. It is about getting skills that 
come with a credential.

    Whereas if I moved to Virginia, to Vermont or to Vegas, I 
am bringing a skill, but I am also bringing a credential that 
an employer will recognize, Okay, yes, you have got the skill. 
Are there industry standard recognized credentials in the AI 
field that are portable like that where I could gain their 
credential and move somewhere else in the United States and an 
employer human resources professional to look at it and say, 
yes, that--Okay, we understand that. I see you shaking your 
head no, Mr. Kotran.

    Mr. Kotran. I think the--thank you. Senator. There is often 
this reflexive reaction to say, well, yes, can we create an AI 
credential? What are the AI jobs of the future? And when you 
talk to folks, some people say, well prompt engineer is the job 
of the future.

    To me that is as ludicrous as going back to 1998 and saying 
a Google search engineer is going to be a job of the future. We 
do not know what the jobs of the future are. If you are 30, the 
real question is, how are you going to build the soft skills, 
the critical thinking, the ability to work in teams 
collaborative----

    Senator Kaine. You call those durable skills in your 
opening testimony. I like that better than soft skills.

    Mr. Kotran. I think that is right. And I think that is 
actually a really big area that we need to focus on, is how do 
we actually codify what these skills would look like, 
especially in a world where the workforce is going to change 
faster than these credentials and frankly our education system 
is going to be able to change.

    This is a really big blind spot that we have. This is like 
a huge tanker ship we are trying to now navigate down River 
Rapids. And the best answer that I can come up with is the 
teachers, the professors, the schools, the folks who are really 
thinking about training our teams, they are on the front lines.

    To me, it is really scary the fact that a company can 
depreciate an investment in an AI tool and get a tax--a 
favorable tax treatment for that. They can't depreciate an 
investment in employee upskilling.

    Senator Kaine. Yes, yes. Dr. Kimbrough, you used the 
phrase, we should expand skills based training, in your 
testimony. So obviously we are moving from a world where it is 
about degrees, to degrees are great, but also skills 
credentials, as long as they are valid, are great. What did you 
mean when you said things we can do is to expand skills based 
training.

    Dr. Kimbrough. Thank you, Senator Kaine. When I was talking 
about skills based hiring in particular, if I may use that 
term, I was thinking a lot about the data that we see at 
LinkedIn, which if we think about what are required skills for 
a job and push away the idea of like what credential do you 
have, even if it was a degree, a former title, prior 
experience, and you say, what skills are you able to perform?

    What we find is that for any role on average, you can 
increase the pool of eligible candidates sometimes by as much 
as 20 times. And so, if I may, I would just say what I think 
can happen is ideally we would be promulgating more pathways 
for employers, for recruiters, for state, and local, and 
Federal Government roles to be skills based as opposed to, 
let's say, degree based or prior experience, because you pull 
in many more people.

    I would just add one last point, which is that what we 
found in our own data is when you expand that talent pool by 
thinking about what people either can do or potentially can do 
as a skill, you actually include more underrepresented people.

    For example, women are 20 percent--26 percent more 
represented when you look at a skills based pool than a non-
skilled based pool.

    Senator Kaine. We have a lot of work to do here in Federal 
policy. Senator Braun and I are working on this. We think Pell 
Grant should not be just limited to college degrees. Why not 
high quality career and technical education? And yet we have 
had a long bias against career and technical education.

    It should be high quality, but why would we benefit college 
and not that? The military has tuition assistance programs for 
active duty. My son used to be a marine officer. He could 
approve somebody in his platoon for up to $4,500 bucks a year 
for a college class.

    But if he had an ordinance specialist who was trained like 
in welding and all he needed was $300 bucks to take the 
American Welding Society certification exam, which is a 
credential that is completely portable, he would have to say, 
no, I can't give you $300 because it is not college.

    Mr. Wilson, I will finish with you if I can real quick. 
Community college. I think this is a key part of this. And I 
mentioned a lot of the folks who gain these skills at a 
community college. They are there to gain the skill, not 
necessarily the associate degree.

    Sometimes the best way to gain the skill is in a short 
term, high intensity class that isn't a 15 weeklong semester 
and hence is not eligible for Pell Grant. Am I right about 
that?

    Mr. Wilson. I believe our program was available for Pell 
Grant, Senator. Now, what I will say is the workforce element 
at the community college level, I think is what really--we 
should really pay attention to.

    It is a 2-year format where you are actually working on 
what you are going to be doing once you graduate instead of 
taking that first 2 year to do general education classes. You 
are actually doing the hands on work, and that is why the 
applied in the Applied degree comes into play because you have 
actually applied the skills to something.

    Whether it is in your last class that you have to take or 
whether it is an internship you got to do over the summer, you 
have actually experienced that and you are more equipped to 
actually get into the workforce. And I think if we pay 
attention to these degree programs, there are a lot of 
community colleges around the country.

    Houston Community College is a great example, Miami Dade 
College, Chandler Gilbert Community College. These are 
community college that took the initiative to start AI 
workforce programs at their school, and now some of them have 
been able to turn it into a bachelor's at the community college 
level, which many people didn't know was possible. So I think 
it is very beneficial.

    I have seen the students coming out of these programs. I am 
one of them. A lot of them are very well equipped. A lot of 
them are very sound in what they know, and they are very 
hungry. They just need--many companies maybe change their 
hiring practice or human resource departments to take off the 
master's or bachelor's degree requirement because they know 
they are already capable with their 2 year degree that they 
got.

    Senator Kaine. As I hand it back to the Chairman, we are 
looking at the same thing with Federal hiring. Do you have to 
have a college degree to get a lot of Federal jobs? And the 
answer is no. Do you have to have a college degree to be 
assigned by a Federal contractor to work on a contract with the 
Federal Government? If you have the skills to do the job, it 
shouldn't be restricted to those with college degrees when we 
are in a skills based world these days. Thank you. I will yield 
back.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Yes, I couldn't agree more. We did, 
back when I was Governor of Colorado in 2017--I guess 2016 and 
2017, we went back and looked at pretty much every job that we 
offer and basically downgraded almost half from saying you had 
to have a college degree, to saying what you really need to be 
successful in this job.

    Oftentimes we would put the college degree in there because 
it was part of that emblem of achievement that made people feel 
that the person was responsible and a good worker in some way, 
whereas that really was no reflection of the skills necessary 
for that job. And I think that is a good point, obviously.

    Senator Budd.

    Senator Budd. Thank you, Chairman. I thank the Ranking 
Member as well. And I appreciate what each of you all bring to 
this conversation as we wrestle with this in the Senate and 
Congress in general.

    I think this is an issue which I think in your term, Mr. 
Wilson, brings anxiety for many, and eagerness and anticipation 
for a lot of others. So I am on the optimistic side, but though 
I acknowledge the whole spectrum here.

    I am a believer in the promise of innovation here in the 
U.S.. I think that the advancements in AI are going to change 
how jobs are done, some of you mentioned that, and not 
necessarily eliminate them in total.

    Dr. Kimbrough, given LinkedIn's unique insights into 
employment trends, what kind of changes do you think AI is 
going to make to the types of jobs, not that are going to be 
eliminated, but the ones that are going to be in demand over 
the next 5 to 10 years?

    Are there specific industries or sectors where you foresee 
job growth due to the advancements in AI?

    Dr. Kimbrough. Thank you, Senator Budd, for that question. 
It is a really hard question, actually, and I am sympathetic to 
it, Mr. Kotran said----

    Senator Budd. We are betting on what you have to say.

    [Laughter.]

    Dr. Kimbrough [continuing]. Nobody--I recognize that. I am 
starting to sweat here. Yes, what I would say--well, one I 
would say is, it is really hard to know what the jobs of the 
future are. I will give you an example of why I say that. Every 
year, LinkedIn puts together a list of the fastest growing jobs 
that we see on our platform, and there are millions of jobs on 
that platform.

    This year, two-thirds of the jobs on that list did not 
exist 20 years ago. So I am very humble as an economist that it 
is hard to forecast. But I want to answer your question, so 
what I would say is some of the things that I think are likely 
to be actually most in demand are some of what we are calling 
the durable skills or the human skills.

    Oftentimes people ask me, what should my child be learning 
or studying? And I am like, abstract problem solving critical 
thinking, communication. Some of these skills are the most in-
demand skills every year on our platform, communication, 
collaboration, leadership strategy. So these are the things 
that I don't expect AI to replace. Thank you.

    Senator Budd. Sure, sure. Maybe some of the community 
college skills. I was thinking of the heat generated through 
some of this computing, and that involves a lot of plumbing and 
processing and HVAC. So there is a lot of skills like that 
perhaps.

    Dr. Kimbrough. We do actually--sorry to interject. We do 
see a lot of demand for electrical engineers, electricians, 
mechanical engineers, plumbers, truck drivers.

    Senator Budd. Yes, absolutely. In a landscape where AI is 
becoming more widely used in the workplace, it is more 
important than ever to be able to quickly reskill and upskill 
workers, as many of you are talked about.

    That is why I introduced both the Pell Act and the Employer 
Directed Skills Act. The Pell Act would allow Pell Grants to be 
used for short term programs. I think like the welding program 
that you mentioned.

    This would allow job seekers to enter the workforce faster 
and make their skills align with the current needs in an AI 
driven world. The Employer Directed Skills Act will give 
employers more resources to prepare job seekers for open jobs.

    This is another way to make sure that we are leveraging 
workers to fill changing roles as AI changes the demands of the 
workforce. Dr. Kimbrough, can you share how you think that some 
of these legislation, not just these but maybe some others 
even, will help job seekers and employers prepare for jobs that 
are going to change as a result of AI?

    Dr. Kimbrough. Yes. So from our data at LinkedIn, what we 
see is there is a huge scarcity of AI literacy talent or AI 
technical talent. There just isn't enough. There is much more 
demand than there is supply for this. And I don't think that we 
are going to replicate or close that gap very easily.

    It is just really critical to have as many pathways as 
possible to create opportunities for America's workforce to 
reskill and upskill in a continuous fashion, not just a one 
off. I go to a community college, and I am done, or but 
really--and not to put down the idea of community college. Very 
supportive of it.

    But really opportunities of small learning. And so one of 
the things that I would say is we very much support anything 
that extends the pathways, even if there is the short term 
programs where people can quickly get credentials to be ready 
to work in the workforce, to meet this--the scarcity, this huge 
demand for AI literacy that isn't being met.

    Senator Budd. Thank you very much. One comment--several 
comments I wanted to make. I know your parent company, 
Microsoft, recently announced a deal to restart--this is really 
outside of maybe some of your projections, but they restarted 
the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.

    The power plant would develop data centers which have a 
growing demand as AI develops and is used more widely. Just one 
query in ChatGPT is estimated to use 10 times as much energy as 
a simple Google search.

    For the first time in decades, our power resource--our 
power requirements are going to increase. But I am very 
concerned. I mean, I see articles like in today's Wall Street 
Journal and it continues on about the need for more clean 
energy, or the steps to get to clean energy. So I am very 
concerned about the current Administration and their positions 
in regards to clean energy. They don't support it.

    Vice President Harris, she has been on the record 
supporting banning fracking. A lot of that out of Pennsylvania, 
which has allowed us to be a net exporter of energy. We need 
all forms of energy, including natural gas, which has 50 
percent fewer carbon emissions than coal. Our biggest 
competitor, China, is going to be using.

    We are not talking that they are going to be using clean 
coal technologies either. And you can bet that China will make 
sure that they have the energy that they need to surpass us in 
AI. So as we think to the future, in the near future, I hope 
that we keep that in mind regarding our energy needs here in 
America. Thank you.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Senator Budd.

    Senator Markey.

    Senator Markey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you so 
much for having this very important hearing. We have heard 
extensive discussion today about the importance of educating 
and training the workforce for the increasing use of AI, but we 
must also prepare the workforce by protecting workers from the 
potential harmful and discriminatory impact of workplace AI 
tools.

    Over the past decade, companies have increasingly 
integrated AI into their hiring. Their firing, and their worker 
management. And time and time again we have seen how the biased 
and discriminatory algorithms powered by AI are used to hire, 
to assess, and to set working conditions that can hurt workers.

    Here are some of the examples. Algorithms that match 
candidates with job opportunities that refer more to men than 
women for open roles. Generative AI chat bots that 
systematically weed out resumes from Black men, from the LGBTQ 
community. And AI that surveils call center workers and grades 
their performance that are more likely to sanction Black women 
for the tone of their voice.

    AI, the sinister side of AI, that is unacceptable. To each 
of the witnesses from left to right, yes or no, do you agree 
that algorithms used to hire and make employment decisions 
should be free from bias and discrimination? Dr. Kimbrel, all 
the way down.

    Dr. Kimbrough. Yes, at LinkedIn, we are committed to 
upholding the principles of responsible AI--yes.

    Mr. Kotran. Yes.

    Mr. Meyer. Yes.

    Mr. Wilson. Yes.

    Senator Markey. That is why yesterday I introduced my AI 
Civil Rights Act of 2024, comprehensive legislation that would 
prevent discriminatory algorithms from being used in critical 
decisions, including employment, because we cannot prepare our 
workforce without protecting our workers simultaneously.

    This technology is Dickensian. It is the best of 
technologies and the worst simultaneously. It can enable. It 
can ennoble. It can degrade. It can debase. It can do it all. 
And we want the best, but we also build in safeguards to 
protect workers from being discriminated against.

    I would also like to take this opportunity to seek 
unanimous consent to enter into the record a letter from the 
National Nurses United, if I may, Mr. Chairman.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Without objection.

    [The following information can be found on page 49 in 
Additional Material:]

    Senator Markey. As the letter states, the development of 
clinical algorithms, ``involves significant use of judgment by 
their creators and creates the opportunity for creative bias, 
from conflicts of interest, limited perspectives on the lives 
of racial minorities, or implicit racial bias to be introduced 
into the algorithm.''

    That is why my AI Civil Rights Act would require companies 
to test these algorithms for discriminatory impact before their 
use, preventing biased AI from being incorporated into resumes 
screening, job recommendations, worker performance, and even 
health care decisions.

    Make no mistake, we can have an AI revolution, while also 
protecting the civil rights and liberties of everyday 
Americans. We can support innovation without supercharging bias 
and discrimination in our society. And we can prepare workers 
while safeguarding their rights. And I might also add, well, 
talking about the fact that a ChatGPT search consumes ten times 
more electricity than a Google search.

    Yes, we are going to need more electricity in our society, 
but the industry is going to have to build in more efficiency 
into their AI technologies. They are promising to find the cure 
for cancer. Well, let's figure out how to make the industry 
more efficient. Can't be having a search consume 10 times as 
much energy as a Google search.

    Do that work. Use AI, I guess, because you are promising to 
find the cure for cancer. How about finding a way to do all 
this much more efficiently? What are the algorithms you are 
using to do that?

    In addition, it is very disheartening for Donald Trump to 
promise to repeal the IRA. To repeal the wind and solar and 
battery storage technology subsidies that are transforming our 
Country, which can make the use of electricity much more benign 
in terms of greenhouse gases.

    He did say to the natural gas industry, if they give him $1 
billion, he would repeal the IRA. Well, that is the way in 
which we can make AI compatible with the climate goals that we 
have simultaneously.

    I just, I heard an earlier comment, and I'll just throw 
that in, that we just can't say it is going to be coal and 
natural gas because we know that we have a renewable revolution 
that is also happening, and we can't stop that. We can't slow 
it down. We have to make sure that we move forward. Thank you, 
Mr. Chairman, very much.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you.

    Senator Casey.

    Senator Casey. I have nothing for today. We can go ahead.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Senator Braun--he has to run. Do you 
have additional questions?

    Senator Braun. Yes, I want to--since we didn't pass into 
another question, I want to go back to the original or the 
ending conversation we had.

    Geopolitical competition to me is so important and we are 
at that kind of point in time where there is so many things at 
stake and we have got this new, and I think the point has been 
made, we are going to see what opportunities and challenges are 
created by it.

    For anyone that would have a view on it, I would like to 
know what areas of commerce, industry, and then what countries 
have gotten out fastest using this. And has there been any 
malicious use of it to date or has it all been beneficial?

    I mean, because we watch this, we hear about it. Do you 
keep track of it? Who has been out on the leading edge either 
in an economy, a country, or a sector of commerce or industry? 
We start over here, Dr. Kimbrough.

    Dr. Kimbrough. Yes. So I really can only speak to the kind 
of data that we see on our platform at LinkedIn, so I am really 
speaking about talent trends here.

    But in terms of building up capacity for skilling, I would 
give one example, which I think is a very interesting one, 
perhaps not scalable for the U.S., where in Singapore, for 
example, there has been--the Government has actually provided 
training funding for every single citizen of Singapore so they 
can upskill in AI.

    I know that is a smaller country than the U.S., but that is 
one example. Another example I would just point to is we see 
very fast growth in AI literacy and technical skills in 
countries like India and Israel. And so, there are a range of 
places where the technical training is just growing much 
quicker than it is in the U.S.

    Senator Braun. They are already ahead of us.

    Dr. Kimbrough. Well, I would say the U.S. has the most--in 
terms of level, the U.S. is very competitive. We have a third 
of the AI technical workers in the U.S., that are here, and a 
third of the AI literacy skills are workers in the U.S.. So we 
have quite a bit, but the growth is faster in other countries.

    Senator Braun. Mr. Kotran.

    Mr. Kotran. I mean, really, the--I mean, this is a game 
between the U.S. and China. I think we are still--as far as I 
understand, we are still in the lead, although what we are 
seeing from China is interesting. One of the things that they 
just have an advantage over us is with respect to the actual 
regulation of the technology.

    One of the things that they recently announced is a 
requirement for AI generated images to be tagged as such. And 
this is happening at a time when in the U.S., there has been 
rampant issues of students making use of notification apps, 
which are basically AI apps that can take an image of somebody 
and de-clothe them.

    This is happening in high schools all over the country. And 
the companies are based in places like Belarus, so we don't 
have the ability to shut these companies down. And in the U.S. 
and in the West in general we are hampered by the democratic 
system and the fact that we have to sort of iteratively build 
the regulations around as the technology evolves. There is 
advantages and disadvantages to that.

    Senator Braun. Mr. Meyer.

    Mr. Meyer. I don't have any intimate knowledge of your 
question. However, I do say at SHRM, one of the things we 
believe in is AI, artificial intelligence, plus HI, human 
intelligence, equals ROI, return on investment.

    I think we are ahead, but I think other folks are catching 
up. And I think it is really important. But one of the things 
is that, and I just want to add this, is that when it comes to 
catching up or staying ahead, one of the great things about AI 
is the individuals have the ability through AI to exercise a 
lot more of their own ownership over their own professional 
development.

    I think that is the really amazing thing about HI, is that 
you can really own your own development. And that is how 
organizations and individuals will be growing with this 
technology, so.

    Senator Braun. Mr. Wilson.

    Mr. Wilson. Yes, thank you for that question, Ranking 
Member Braun. I don't have any information in front of me today 
to really give you a solid answer, but I would like to follow 
with your office with some more information later.

    Senator Braun. Thank you.

    Senator Hickenlooper. If he leaves, then I have got you all 
to myself. This is every Senator's dream. I thought it would be 
interesting--and I won't keep you too long, I promise.

    But I think that this notion of where do we get our 
standards, how do we codify, what is the appropriate way to do 
this, it ties back into that--a little bit of that disadvantage 
that we have compared to totalitarian countries where they 
could just decide that everything is going to be somehow 
watermarked or that transparency on what is and what is not AI.

    Personally, I think that is one of the--should be one of 
our absolute imperatives with a greater sense of urgency. But I 
would love to hear each of you just talk about where do you 
think, how should we go about finding the standards, the 
guidelines for this?

    Dr. Kimbrough, I was also going to ask you just because I 
am so out of touch. How big is--like, how many members do you--
you were talking about your members. How many members do you 
have?

    Dr. Kimbrough. Worldwide, LinkedIn has over a billion 
members.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Oh my goodness.

    Dr. Kimbrough. They are not all online at the same time. 
But yes, we have a billion members. In the U.S., it is just 
about 200 million.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Gosh, talk about energy usage. 
Anyway, so what's your slant on this notion of how do we codify 
standards? Where do we get standards and how do we codify them?

    Dr. Kimbrough. Chairman Hickenlooper, I am a macro 
economist, so I am not going to--I don't want to wiggle out of 
the answer, but what I was----

    Senator Hickenlooper. I am an out of work geologist and 
they expect me to have an opinion on these things.

    [Laughter.]

    Dr. Kimbrough. I am sure you are way smarter than I am. 
What I would say is I think that where we stand at LinkedIn is 
really thinking about how do we embrace accountability for what 
we do?

    How do we ensure that we are transparent about what we do? 
How do we make sure we put our members first, which is 
paramount for us. And starting with those kinds of principles, 
everything we build, every design choice we make is around 
ensuring that we are providing value to the member first and 
protecting them.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Okay.

    Mr. Kotran.

    Mr. Kotran. Yes, I am also going to differ on talking about 
specific policies. What I will say is, I think it is folly for 
us to ever imagine that we can regulate away the risks that AI 
poses.

    I think there is like soft examples of like a worker making 
a decision to use an AI tool to screen an applicant or even to 
like write interview questions, and it would be very hard for 
us to really think about what would even look like to have 
regulation that completely blocks that.

    Then there is also logistically things like a watermark, a 
digital watermark. I mean, it just may be impossible for us to 
truly block all the companies that are going to provide people 
with the ability to create AI images, because many of them will 
be overseas and out of jurisdiction.

    But I will say that whatever the standards are, you have to 
have an informed and educated populace and we have to actually 
build social norms. And the same, the social norm, like nobody 
has their phones out on the table.

    That is something that when you go to dinner, people don't 
sit and that you turn your phone over. I think there needs to 
be a norm where someone shows you a generated image of somebody 
and you almost respond like aghast, like oh my god, did you ask 
permission to create their image.

    I think right now, we haven't really quite figured out what 
is the role of even just sort of these social norms or these 
soft standards, let alone the hard ones.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Yes. Although those norms are 
dependent upon somehow some standards, some regulations in 
place. And you--we know we are not going to get to everybody 
who runs the stop sign, right, or slides through a yellow 
light, runs a red light, right. But we still have those 
regulations.

    If we had watermarks, certainly we are not going to get 
everybody, but once you set the rules, you are going to get 98 
percent, and you will at least have an avenue to go after the 
people that abuse the system.

    Mr. Kotran. If I may, so I actually started my career in 
AI, working on ethics and governance. And we worked with NIST 
on how do you set standards for the use of AI in the legal 
system.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Well just parrot back some of that 
stuff. Come on.

    Mr. Kotran. Well, so what I would say is any conversation 
about AI ethics, and you are going to hear the same things. You 
are going to hear; algorithmic bias is something we need to 
deal with. You are going to hear about how do we make sure 
there is a human in the loop.

    I have heard this rhetoric for now, six, seven, 8 years. 
And so none of this is new. I mean, we actually know, roughly 
speaking, what we need to aim toward. And others like very 
tactical, practical policy questions of do we create laws and 
enforcement mechanisms?

    If not, then I think we have to answer the question of 
like, well what are the other incentives that we can create, 
whether it is for businesses or otherwise? But I just don't 
know that we can--I don't think business standards by 
themselves are sufficient.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Right. Well, we will have--we can 
discuss that more fully later. Mr. Meyer, what is your stance 
on some of these--this notion of standards?

    Mr. Meyer. I guess the standards that are going to be set 
essentially are going to come from you, Senator Hickenlooper, 
and others like you. But here is the thing, and this is the 
most important thing, there needs to be a balance between 
responsible use. And responsible use should be paramount.

    These tools need to be developed, they need to be used 
without bias. And they need to be developed, and they need to 
be used without hallucinations. Those are the two big things. 
However, we also need to not have rules--that eliminates the 
use of this technology from employers and organizations like, 
say, my community health center.

    For every dollar we spend on new technology, that is a 
dollar that we are taking away from patients, but we do 
understand, we have to have a balance in our finances. But in 
New York City layering on top and on top of the decision we 
make to spend the money on the technology, then to have to now 
spend the money on the auditing and all of this.

    Essentially, New York City made the decision for us not to 
use that technology. That is what happened because it is just 
too darned expensive. And I think that there were over one 
million nonprofits in the entire country, a million, and many 
of these serve underserved communities.

    The thing is, this technology can really help us serve 
people better. I would just think there needs to be a balance 
in whatever standards, rules, laws, regulations are developed 
that allow for organizations to use and develop technology 
while at the same time--while at the same time protecting 
people from bias and from hallucinations that come along with 
the technology.

    I do not envy your job. That is going to be very, very 
difficult. We understand that. But that is where we fall. That 
is where----

    Senator Hickenlooper. I won't complain. I mean, my 
grandfather told me when we were little, if you are lucky 
enough to sleep in the bed that you made, don't complain. So, I 
won't do that. But I do think it is interesting to get 
different viewpoints on where, should the standards come from.

    Should it be NIST? Should it be some other maybe even more 
global entity that whereby forces people to come together and 
make some of the accommodations and assumptions that allow us 
to get to a place where, as you are saying, even as we are 
continuing to improve those standards, we have got pioneers out 
there experimenting and creating new innovations.

    Mr. Wilson. But Senator, on the plus side, and I mean on 
the really good side is you have people like us that are 
willing to help you out with it.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Exactly.

    Mr. Meyer. We at SHRM, we are fully prepared to help you 
out with it.

    Senator Hickenlooper. That is why I am asking.

    Mr. Meyer. Yes.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Mr. Wilson.

    Mr. Wilson. Yes, sir. It is a great question, Chairman. Let 
me throw you a bone here. So, Seed AI strongly supports the 
NIST AI risk management framework, as well as other entities 
like the AI Safety Institute and the National AI Research 
Resource.

    We believe that if these entities were funded and given the 
leeway to actually build and test and develop the standards, 
that is the direction that we should go for.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Youth. I have got lots of youth on 
the panel. And Mr. Wilson we didn't get a chance to get to it, 
but I thought your story in Houston of how you--the community 
college and how you kind of found a whole new avenue through--
why don't you tell a little bit of your story? I don't want to 
embarrass you, but you put it in you statement, so.

    Mr. Wilson. Yes, it is no problem, sir. Yes, so growing up, 
I was more so focused on like football. I am a huge football 
guy. I played football 20 years of my life. And I was always 
sort of ashamed of showing that I was intelligent.

    I was the honors kid in high school, but I had to keep the, 
a certain image of, a captain of football team. So once I 
graduated, I kind of was able to get more so into what I 
actually was passionate about, which is technology and helping 
people.

    When I got to Houston after moving around through four of 
the states, it was a new start for me. And I saw that it was an 
environment that allowed people to thrive. It was a healthy 
innovation environment.

    There were a lot of hungry people. And I don't know if it 
was by luck, but when COVID hit and I was laid off and Houston 
Community College magically had just started an AI program, I 
think it was just a match made in heaven.

    I took it and ran with it, and I wanted to galvanize other 
students around the same thing. So we built a pretty large 
community out there around AI. We actually, me and some of the 
students started an AI conference at the school, and the school 
ended up picking it up, and they do that event every year now.

    There is a lot of good things that came out of that 
program. We just kind of want to spread it across the country 
and kind of get everybody on the same page as far as what we 
need to do.

    Senator Hickenlooper. That is something we can all 
promote--I love that story. Certainly the potential of AI to 
create that catharsis in people I think is tremendous. And 
however we work with teachers and teachers unions to make sure 
that we accelerate and amplify those opportunities is going to 
be powerful.

    Whether--I mean College Board, I know that they look at a 
different types of AP tests now that might be skills based and 
might move in a different direction than what you traditionally 
think of as AP chemistry or AP biology. I think AI is going to 
allow for that.

    We have had several hearings here on apprenticeships and 
how important it is to have a lifetime learning. I think almost 
all of you said something either in your statements or today 
where you referred to that sense that we got to--we are going 
to be learning new skills.

    Everyone is going to be learning new skills for their whole 
lifetime, and how do we facilitate that? In other words, we 
need apprenticeships for people of all ages where you can go 
and work part time in a different role so that you can acquire 
new skills. And that is the, I own--my little secret.

    I don't always blurt it out, but we got so excited about 
someday having a centralized place with all the skills and 
figuring out how do you--how do you have a set of standards 
about--if you have got this patch mark, what skills have you 
got? How can you demonstrate you are competent with those 
skills? But I own and I am donating. This is not a for profit 
thing, but I own myshot.com.

    If you have ever heard the musical Hamilton where he says, 
I am not throwing away my shot, I am not throwing away. Well 
that is where myshot.com is going to take all the work that all 
of you are doing and have it in one place and allow that 
lifetime learning, that application of a lifetime learning to 
really, really grow.

    Because I think that is the only way we are going to deal 
with this. This is going to be a transition over the next 20 
years. Look at clean energy. All these things are happening at 
once and we are going to look back 50 years, 80 years from now, 
going to look back at this as the beginning of the great 
transition.

    Anyway, you guys are all part of that. Thank you so much 
for coming and spending your time. I have got to read my 
closing statement, so I don't legally forget something. If 
anybody has final statement, something you think the U.S. 
Senate should absolutely know? I guess I have worn you out.

    In that case, this will end today's hearing. I want to 
thank again all of our colleagues who were able to join us in-
person, people watching online, and especially I want to thank 
our witnesses, Ms. Kimbrough, Mr. Kotran, Mr. Meyer, Mr. 
Wilson. Thank you for your participation. I know you are all 
just as busy as we are and you took time out of your lives to 
be here for--well, for our Country.

    Any Senators who wish to ask additional questions, 
questions for the record will be due in 10 business days, so on 
October 9th by 5.00 p.m.. The Committee now stands adjourned.

                          ADDITIONAL MATERIAL

      the american federation of labor and congress of industrial 
                             organizations
    Thank you Chairman Hickenlooper and Ranking Member Braun for the 
opportunity to provide a written statement for the record for your 
Subcommittee hearing ``Reading the Room: Preparing Workers for AI.'' 
The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial 
Organizations (AFL-CIO) is a voluntary, democratic federation of 60 
affiliated unions representing more than 12.5 million workers in all 
sectors of our economy. Our core mission is to ensure that working 
people are treated fairly and with respect, that our hard work is 
rewarded with family supporting wages and benefits, and that our 
workplaces are safe. We also provide an independent voice in politics 
and legislation for working women and men and make their voices heard.

    We appreciate the Subcommittee's attention to engaging labor unions 
and their members in the policy-making process to ensure that workers 
shape the future of work. Workers should be protected and positioned to 
thrive as artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more widespread in the 
workplace. The AFL-CIO looks forward to the HELP Committee building on 
this hearing to take a greater role in the work that is needed to 
legislate and advance critical policies on AI.

    We know that AI systems will have a profound impact on American 
society, on the workplace and on the workforce. AI has the potential to 
enhance workplace safety and help workers do more meaningful work. It 
will also potentially bring great changes to the way many people 
perform their work. AI will affect job quality, including technical 
standards and best practices, wages and benefits, hiring and retention, 
worker rights, safety and well-being, and workforce development. 
Therefore, this topic should be of primary importance to the HELP 
Committee and its Subcommittees to ensure workers are engaged and 
protected from harm and share in the benefits of AI. As the Federal 
agency focused on workplaces and workers, the Department of Labor (DOL) 
should be heavily engaged in promoting and enforcing AI regulations and 
policies.

    The AFL-CIO believes that the most beneficial way to prepare the 
workforce for AI is to advance a worker-centered approach that ensures 
workers are at the hub of AI design, development, implementation, and 
the formulation of AI policy that governs its deployment. A worker-
centered AI agenda takes seriously the many ways AI already impacts 
workers and gives workers a say over how AI affects workplaces and 
jobs. It also ensures AI empowers and benefits workers, safeguards 
civil rights and democracy, promotes human-centric creativity, and 
guarantees workers access to the training, wraparound support, and 
career pathways they need to succeed. Central to this approach is 
promoting policies that prioritize and remove legal impediments for 
workers to organize, form unions and collectively bargain. Increasing 
worker power will positively affect how AI is designed, developed and 
implemented and it will ensure that policies related to worker concerns 
are addressed: for instance, identifying who is liable if the 
technology has negative outcomes or whether there is sufficient 
transparency and opportunity for workers to understand and opt out of 
data collection.

    It is also crucial for policymakers to implement worker-centered, 
union-led workforce training so that workers have a direct say in 
shaping their future. They must have a voice in AI skills development, 
efforts to address job quality and security, safe and ethical AI 
implementation, and within meaningful partnerships with employers on 
sector-based AI skills strategies.

    The AFL-CIO and the AFL-CIO Technology Institute have entered into 
an agreement with Microsoft where our affiliated unions and Microsoft 
can learn about the real-life, real-time implications of the deployment 
of AI. The partnership also includes a neutrality framework for worker 
organizing by AFL-CIO affiliate unions. In a recent summit, we were 
able to bring together high level decision-makers to have discussions 
about the ways that AI is affecting workers on the job and how 
technological innovation could be improved by consulting with workers 
in the process. Additionally, Microsoft is working with the American 
Federation of Teachers, to leverage career and technical education work 
that can help prepare today's students for tomorrow's jobs. While we 
continue to work to ensure Microsoft and its subsidiaries treat workers 
with dignity and respect, we are excited about the possibilities of 
partnering with Microsoft to better understand how workers and 
corporations can collaborate to create better outcomes in the new 
technology development pipeline.

    While AI, developed and implemented with workers at the table, may 
hold the potential to augment and enhance work, there are examples 
today of poorly conceived AI applications that not only harm workers 
but also the public at large. A role for worker voice and consent with 
regard to AI technologies is necessary to mitigate worker harms, ensure 
broad benefit, and safeguard against the use of AI that worsens already 
rampant inequality. For example, AI technologies could potentially 
increase workplace safety, but could also cause harm by putting workers 
under undue stress through work intensification and the override of 
human-derived decisions. Workers are on the frontlines of ensuring a 
safe, productive workplace and have the firsthand knowledge to inform 
how AI is best deployed. It is essential that worker input plays a 
significant role in the research and design, development, deployment 
and oversight of any AI system. Further, firms should partner with 
unions to leverage labor's expertise in developing workforce training 
programs, helping to recruit and retain workers, and using workers' 
frontline experience to improve the effectiveness and equity of 
technology deployment. Partnership with labor is also the best way to 
give workers a voice in how AI impacts their work and how the benefits 
of increased productivity are shared. We need a cohesive national 
approach to workforce development that centers labor-management 
partnerships and a national commitment to place-based economic 
development with labor at the table.

    The AFL-CIO believes it is possible to be both pro-worker and pro-
technology: because of this we believe the most ethical approach to the 
adoption and regulation of AI is through policy that requires the 
effects on workers be considered, and negative impacts, be mitigated on 
the front end. Nonetheless, without proactive policy guardrails, 
certain workers are likely to be hard hit by AI and Congress must act 
to protect them. A good example exists in the creative industries where 
the workers are experiencing unregulated AI, with some devastating 
effects, including the ingestion of copyrighted works without 
compensation or consent for training AI systems. This threatens the 
economic livelihoods of union creative professionals. These individuals 
will lose out on collectively bargained royalties, residuals, and 
contributions to their health care and retirement funds that come from 
the authorized sales and streaming of the creative works they helped 
make. Although many of these workers have taken matters into their own 
hands by striking for better protections and incorporating protections 
into collective bargaining agreements, these and many other examples 
across the private and public sector need the attention of Congress--
and specifically this Committee--to ensure that workers are protected.

    Hearings that consider the effects of AI on workers are a good 
first step to understand the guardrails we need but we must move beyond 
thinking that the way to address the issue is to simply prepare the 
workforce for the advent of AI. While this is of course an important 
part of the adoption of AI, workers have been building, and continue to 
build, skills to manage technology advances. To effectively manage AI, 
policies must also consider how best to create an environment that will 
protect workers from negative consequences like bias, unsafe 
workplaces, unfettered workplace surveillance and data collection, and 
the removal of worker privacy.

    We welcome this hearing, and future engagement with the Committee, 
to make further progress toward addressing the potential harms, while 
capitalizing on the potential benefits, of AI. The expertise of the 
HELP Committee and DOL can be brought to bear on critical AI policy, 
design, development and implementation questions. We look forward to 
working with the Committee to advance our shared goal of developing 
robust AI policy that centers and benefits workers, their families, and 
the communities where they live and work.

Hon. John Hickenlooper, Chairman,
Hon. Mike Braun, Ranking Member,
U.S. Senate HELP Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety,
U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions
Washington, DC.

    Dear Chairman Hickenlooper, Ranking Member Braun:

    On behalf of the National Retail Federation (NRF), I write to thank 
you for calling today's hearing entitled, ``Reading the Room: Preparing 
Workers for AI.'' I am pleased to share the views of the retail 
industry on this important matter. Retailers of all sizes legally and 
responsibly utilize automated systems to monitor, manage and evaluate 
their workers. NRF respectfully requests that this letter be made a 
part of the official record of today's hearing.

    The National Retail Federation passionately advocates for the 
people, brands, policies and ideas that help retail succeed. From its 
headquarters in Washington, DC, NRF empowers the industry that powers 
the economy. Retail is the Nation's largest private-sector employer, 
contributing $5.3 trillion to annual GDP and supporting more than one 
in four U.S. jobs--55 million working Americans. For over a century, 
NRF has been a voice for every retailer and every retail job, 
educating, inspiring and communicating the powerful impact retail has 
on local communities and global economies.

    Automated systems have become indispensable tools for the retail 
industry, offering benefits including enhanced workplace safety, 
productivity, compliance, and security. Retailers have found that such 
tools increase organizational efficiency, improve business operations, 
contribute to economic growth, and benefit the overall well-being of 
their employees.

    Retailers' health and safety programs have also been enhanced by 
automated systems. For instance, sensors can monitor warehouse 
conditions, ensuring that equipment operates safely and temperatures 
remain at optimal levels. Wearable technology can reduce physical 
strain on employees by providing real-time feedback. In-cabin 
monitoring systems can alert truck drivers to fatigue or distractions, 
helping to prevent accidents and improve overall safety. Retailers have 
found that AI-powered safety platforms can significantly reduce the 
occurrence of accidents and unsafe driving incidents, potentially 
saving workers' lives.

    Productivity monitoring systems can help manage remote workforces, 
allocate tasks effectively, and provide objective assessments of 
employee performance. These systems can also identify potential 
hazards, such as repetitive stress injuries, and help maintain 
appropriate staffing levels. By investing in automated systems, 
retailers can enhance employee efficiency and create a more productive 
work environment.

    Automated monitoring systems can play a vital role in ensuring that 
workers are paid accurately for their time. By tracking work hours and 
minimizing ``off-the-clock'' work, these systems help employers comply 
with wage and hour regulations. This not only protects workers' rights 
but also reduces the risk of legal disputes and penalties.

    Retailers' workplace security has been enhanced by automated 
systems. Video surveillance systems can deter theft, violence, and 
other security threats, protecting both employees and customers. 
Additionally, automated systems can help prevent unauthorized access to 
sensitive areas, reducing the risk of theft or loss. By implementing 
appropriate security measures, retailers can create a safer and more 
secure work environment for their employees.

    In all these areas, retailers implement automated systems in 
compliance with existing laws and regulations. The current laws on the 
books are sufficient to ensure that automated systems protect 
employees.

    Again, I thank you for calling this hearing and for your attention 
to this issue.

            Sincerely,
                                      David French,
                                  Executive Vice President,
                                      Government Relations.
                                 ______
                                 
                            National Nurses United,
                                            Washington, DC,
                                                September 25, 2024.
Hon. John Hickenlooper, Chairman,
Hon. Mike Braun, Ranking Member,
U.S. Senate HELP Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety,
U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions
Washington, DC.

    Dear Chairman Hickenlooper, Ranking Member Braun, and Members of 
the Committee:

    In light of the Committee's hearing today titled ``Reading the 
Room: Preparing Workers for AI,'' I write to you on behalf of National 
Nurses United, the Nation's largest union and professional association 
of registered nurses (RNs). Our nearly 225,000 members primarily work 
in acute care hospitals, where they are already working with and 
experiencing the impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) and data-
driven technologies at the hospital bedside. Given the lack of health 
care worker representation at the hearing, we wanted to share directly 
with you why it's essential that health care workers have the right to 
be consulted and engaged on all policies, procedures, and best 
practices surrounding the implementation of AI.

    The health care industry has been implementing various forms of 
artificial intelligence and other data driven technologies for a number 
of years. The nursing workforce is therefore uniquely situated to 
provide feedback and analysis on the impacts that these technologies 
have had on workers and on patients. In the experience of nurses, the 
decisions to implement these technologies are often made without the 
knowledge of either nurses or patients and are putting patients and the 
nurses who care for them at risk. Technologies that have already been 
implemented include the clinical decision support systems embedded in 
electronic health records (EHRs), acute-care hospital-at-home and 
remote patient monitoring schemes, virtual acute-care nursing, 
automated worker surveillance and management (AWSM), staffing platforms 
that support gig nursing and understaff hospital units to unsafe 
levels, and increasingly, emerging technologies like generative AI 
systems.

    Many of these technologies may be used to track the activities of 
health care workers and interfere in union activity. Automated 
monitoring technology feeds into algorithmic management systems that 
make unreasonable and inaccurate decisions about patient acuity, 
staffing, and care with the goal of lowering labor costs. As a result, 
nurses and other health care professionals are expected to work faster, 
accept more patients per nurse than is safe, and reduce nurses' use of 
independent professional skill and judgment, ultimately endangering 
patients. Studies show that when RNs are forced to care for too many 
patients at one time, patients are at higher risk of preventable 
medical errors, avoidable complications, falls and injuries, \1\ 
pressure ulcers, \2\ increased length of hospital stay, higher numbers 
of hospital readmissions, and death. \3\

    Additionally, tracking nurse actions is designed to facilitate 
routinization--breaking the holistic process of nursing into discrete 
tasks--with the goal of replacing educated registered nurses exercising 
independent judgment with unlicensed or lower-licensed staff following 
algorithmic instructions to reduce labor costs. Registered nurses have 
extensive education and clinical experience that enables them to 
provide safe, therapeutic patient care. Even the simplest RN-patient 
interactions involve skilled assessment and evaluation of the patient's 
overall condition. Subtle changes in a patient's skin tone, respiratory 
rate, demeanor, and affect provide critical information about their 
health and well-being that can be easily overlooked or misinterpreted 
by those without an RN's education and clinical experience. Attempts to 
routinize and deskill registered nursing practice undermines safe

patient care.

    Employers generally assert that these powerful technologies are 
just updates of older technology that has long been in the workplace, 
such as treating computer-vision aided cameras the same as traditional 
security cameras, or EHRs as electronic versions of old paper medical 
records. However, these technologies are much more than modern 
iterations of well understood tools and are being introduced widely 
despite lack of robust research showing safety, reliability, 
effectiveness, and equity. Rather, AWSM technologies pull vast and 
diverse data from an entire ecosystem of monitoring equipment and 
process this information through opaque algorithms that then make 
clinical and employment decisions. There is no current method for 
evaluating AI being used in nursing practice applications, and no 
requirement for external validation; it is clear to nurses that AI 
technologies are being designed to be a replacement for skilled 
clinicians as opposed to a tool that many clinicians would find 
helpful.

    The right for union workers to bargain over whether and how 
technology should be implemented in the workplace before it is selected 
or deployed must be protected. Workers have the right to understand how 
the decisions governing their working lives are made--including 
hiring--and patients have the right to understand how the decisions 
concerning their care are made, including insurance coverage 
determinations. Through our experiences working with and around these 
systems, it is clear to registered nurses that hospital employers have 
used these technologies in attempts to outsource, devalue, deskill, and 
automate our work. Doing so increases their profit margins at the 
expense of patient care and safety.

    In our experience in the health care sector, labor-management 
partnerships do not serve the interests of patients or the workers who 
care for them, instead benefiting the employer. Proposals to utilize 
labor management partnership to self-regulate AI in the healthcare 
setting are insufficient and would be ineffective. They must not be 
used in place of comprehensive pre-market testing, approval and 
monitoring by a regulatory agency. Congress must both ensure strong 
regulation of AI, while also strengthening the rights of workers to 
organize and bargain collectively.

    Nurses have grave concerns about the fundamental limits on the 
ability of algorithms to meet the needs of individual patients, 
especially when those patients are part of racial or ethnic groups that 
are less well represented in the data. Nurses know that clinical 
algorithms can interfere with safe, therapeutic health care that meets 
the needs of each individual patient. While clinical algorithms may 
purport to be an objective analysis of the scientific evidence, in fact 
their development involves significant use of judgment by their 
creators and creates the opportunity for creator bias--from conflicts 
of interest, limited perspective on the lives of racial minorities, or 
implicit racial bias--to be introduced into the algorithm.

    In sum, we are deeply concerned about the use of AI in nursing 
practice in acute care hospitals. We appreciate the subcommittee's 
interest in examining the impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) and 
data-driven technologies on the U.S. workforce. As the Nation's largest 
union of registered nurses, we look forward to working with you on this 
important matter.

            Sincerely,

                         QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

     Response by Dr. Karin Kimbrough to Questions of Senator Lujan
                             senator lujan
    Question 1. In your written testimony, you break down the labor 
impacts on AI and photography is given as an example of a profession 
that will be disrupted. How does your research team at LinkedIn foresee 
AI impacting the work of creatives (including visual artists, authors, 
photographers, filmmakers, screenwriters, musicians)?

    Answer 1. All tech evolutions start with disruption, but in the 
aggregate the impact is likely to be net positive because for the vast 
majority of people, AI isn't replacing their job but transforming it, 
and their next job might even be a role that doesn't exist yet. 
Globally, when we look at our data, skills for the average job are 
projected to change by 50 percent by 2030 compared to 2016--and 
generative AI is expected to accelerate this change rate to nearly 70 
percent.

    While we don't discount the challenges disruptive technologies can 
create for workers, we do nonetheless expect to see job creation as a 
result of AI. History tells us that new waves of technological 
innovation tend to create more jobs than they displace. Just as web 
developers, cybersecurity experts, social media managers, and content 
creators proliferated with the rise of the internet, new AI roles--
across ethics, research, design and other fields--will emerge in the 
coming years.

    With respect to the creative fields, it is, in fact, likely that 
jobs will be disrupted by AI. However, we don't see disruption as 
eliminating these jobs completely, but rather changing how jobs are 
done and the skills needed for these occupations. For example, authors 
may use AI to help them generate ideas, develop plot structures, and 
supplement background research for their work. Academic studies have 
shown that AI is useful in jumpstarting projects, but can struggle when 
generating truly novel ideas and struggle with tasks that are beyond 
the frontier of their training data.

    Question 2. What can be done to ensure that creative industry 
workers whose work is disrupted by generative AI are not driven from 
their profession entirely?

    Answer 2. At a high level, it is important for workers to 
understand both how their job will be impacted by AI (i.e. how the 
skills or technology they use will change) and what training is 
available to them to adapt and learn new skills that allow them to 
leverage AI and augment their work, rather than eliminating what they 
are doing. We also think that developers and deployers of AI tools 
should be thinking about this impact and incorporating worker voice in 
ways that not only improve the products and services being developed, 
but are also mindful of the impact they will have on workers.

    Additionally, LinkedIn Learning offers a variety of courses to help 
creative professionals leverage AI in their jobs. From general courses 
like ``Integrating Generative AI into the Creative Process'' to courses 
aimed at specific creative professions, like ``Photoshop and Lightroom: 
Portrait Retouching in the Age of AI'' for photographers.

          Response by Mr. Wilson to Questions of Senator Lujan
                             senator lujan
    Question 1. What impact does broadband access and affordability--
and the current digital divide that exists in the U.S.--have on the 
efforts to accelerate AI preparedness for teachers, students and future 
workers?

    Answer 1. Access to the internet is an essential requirement for 
any person--student, teacher, current and future workers, or 
otherwise--to meaningfully participate in an AI-driven economy. If a 
person cannot afford or otherwise access broadband, their ability to 
learn about and use AI, co-create with the technology, and seek new 
opportunities to gain and leverage AI skills will be severely limited.

    Question 2. In your written testimony, you discuss the importance 
of building accessible and affordable AI infrastructure, including 
data, compute, models and training. In addition to these components of 
AI infrastructure, does Seed AI agree that high speed broadband access 
and affordability is a critical component that is necessary for 
enabling AI preparedness?

    Answer 2. Yes, SeedAI agrees that affordable and accessible 
Internet access is a necessary part of a broader strategy to promote AI 
preparedness.
