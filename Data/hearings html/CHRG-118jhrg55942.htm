                              ----------                              


                        TUESDAY, MARCH 12, 2024

                            United States Congress,
                                  Joint Economic Committee,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The committee met, pursuant to call, at 2:28 p.m., in Room 
210, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. David Schweikert [vice 
chairman of the committee] presiding.
    Present: Schweikert, Arrington, Trone, Beyer, Smucker, 
Estes, Porter, and Ferguson.
    Senators: Heinrich and Hassan.
    Staff Present: Nicolas Aguelakakis, Lesley Asencio, Shauna 
Burton, Christina Carr, Matthew Cernicky, Jaxson Dealy, Sebi 
Devlin-Foltz, Ron Donado, Colleen Healy, Jeremy Johnson, Hunter 
Lovell, Jessica Martinez, Kole Nichols, Michael Pearson, 
Alfredo Romero, Jeff Schlagenhauf, Alex Schunk, Doug Simons, 
and Garrett Wilbanks.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. This hearing will come to order.
    I would like to welcome everyone to today's Joint Economic 
hearing, titled ``The Fiscal Situation of the United States.''
    Today's hearing will begin with 5-minute opening statements 
from myself, Chairman Heinrich, and each of our four witnesses. 
We will then proceed to questions, alternating between the 
parties in order of member arrival. Members are reminded to 
please keep their questions to no more than 5 minutes.
    And, now, opening statement.
    Before I actually read the formal opening statement, my 
heresy in many of these discussions--is that volume awfully 
loud, or is it just the feedback?--is, I truly, truly believe, 
from today through the next 30 years, our crisis in debt and 
deficit spending, economic growth is demographics.
    And what saddens me is, having taken a quick look through 
some of the testimony, I don't think we give enough honest 
discussion of the fact of the matter is, you know, one in six 
Americans now will be 65 and up, and that number moves away 
from us, and in 15 years we have more deaths than births.
    So my caveat is, if we are going to actually make honest 
policy, maybe we need to be brutally, brutally honest with each 
other in the math.
    Now I would like to introduce our four distinguished 
witnesses.
    Dr. Michael----is it ``Funken''?
    Dr. Faulkender. ``Faulkender.''
    Vice Chairman Schweikert [continuing]. Faulkender--sorry, I 
should have had that--is the chief economist and senior advisor 
at the America First Policy Institute. Before that, he was 
Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy at the United States 
Department of Treasury, where he advised the Treasury Secretary 
on domestic and international economic issues.
    Ms. ``Roma''----
    Mrs. Boccia. ``Romina Boccia.''
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. Romina Boccia. And I should know 
that.
    Mrs. Boccia is director of budget and entitlement policy at 
Cato Institute, where she specializes in the budget process, 
Federal spending, and the economic impacts of rising debt. 
Prior to that, she was the director of the Grover M. Hermann 
Center for the Federal Budget at The Heritage Foundation.
    All good?
    Chairman Heinrich. Good afternoon, everyone.
    And thank you, Vice Chairman Schweikert, and thank you 
for--you and your staff for putting this hearing together 
today.
    The financial growth of our nation is critical to our 
stability and growth. And, in the most basic sense, our 
financial health is what allows us to invest in the people and 
the places of the United States.
    Last week, I was proud to vote for the long-overdue package 
of six appropriations bills that included major investments in 
our families and our communities. And, among many other 
priorities, I fought to secure full funding for Special 
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and 
Children, better known to the public as WIC, which serves 
nearly 7 million women and children nationwide.
    As I worked to make sure that families could put food on 
the table and that our housing programs had enough funding to 
keep roofs over their heads, there were others who opposed 
these investments, pointing to our deficit.
    It is true that our deficits and debt are expected to grow 
in the coming years, and we do need to take this very 
seriously. But that starts with being clear about where these 
deficits actually come from and what will actually work to help 
close them.
    Much like any family's budget, when you look at our federal 
budget, it is a comparison of what is coming in against what is 
going out--revenue and spending. And it is clear that, with our 
federal budget, we have a revenue problem. Republican tax cuts 
for the wealthiest of the wealthy and biggest corporations have 
driven our revenue down and our debt up.
    To restore financial stability and rein in our debt, we 
need tax reforms. We need to close tax loopholes for the ultra-
wealthy and maintain funding for the Internal Revenue Service 
so that they can go after wealthy tax cheats, who for too long 
have gotten away without paying their fair share.
    That includes imposing a minimum tax on billionaires, 
because no billionaire should be paying less in taxes than a 
teacher or a sanitation worker or a grocery clerk. We need to 
raise the corporate tax so that big companies pay their fair 
share, a move that would alone raise $1.3 trillion over the 
next decade. And we need to adopt the global minimum tax to 
make sure that multinational companies can't get out of paying 
U.S. taxes.
    At the same time, we should limit costly tax expenditures 
that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy, like lower tax rates 
for capital gains and stock dividends or the carried-interest 
loophole that allows hedge fund executives to pay less in 
taxes. These policies reward wealth over work while pushing up 
our deficits.
    Congress can also shore up Social Security and Medicare 
without cutting benefits. And, for one, Congress should make 
sure that people earning over $400,000 pay more into the Social 
Security Trust Fund. Asking the highest earners to pay a small 
portion of every dollar earned would go a long way towards 
improving the health of the program.
    Another proposal by President Biden would raise the 
Medicare payroll tax by 1.2 percentage points solely on 
taxpayers making over $400,000 a year. This and other small tax 
changes would make Medicare solvent for the foreseeable future.
    But perhaps our most important tool for reducing deficits 
is continued economic growth. The Biden administration has led 
some of the strongest economic growth that we have seen in 
recent years. This administration is working to build an 
economy from the middle out, from the bottom up.
    And that has meant record-breaking job growth, with nearly 
15 million jobs created since President Biden took office. 
Unemployment has been below 4 percent for 2 full years, the 
longest stretch in half a century. And we have seen 
unprecedented investments in infrastructure and a domestic 
manufacturing renaissance.
    This strategy works because a booming economy boosts tax 
revenues without requiring higher tax rates.
    To achieve that, we need to keep investing in what helps 
grow our economy, including our children. Investing in programs 
for children, like WIC or SNAP, delivers a brighter future for 
those kids, and it also creates a substantial long-term benefit 
for our economy. Supports like early-childhood education, 
healthcare, and nutrition programs lay the foundation for 
healthier and more productive adults. They are then less likely 
to need social support services and more likely to participate 
in the labor force and earn higher incomes.
    A permanent expansion of the Child Tax Credit could go a 
long way towards that goal. By empowering families, we lift 
kids out of poverty, stimulate the economy, and increase tax 
revenues.
    Investing in our economy means investing in all of America. 
And I am pleased to join my colleagues to further explore these 
issues in today's hearing.
    Now, I would like to introduce our two distinguished 
witnesses.
    Mr. Michael Linden is a senior policy fellow at the 
Washington Center for Equitable Growth. He has more than 15 
years of experience in economic policy roles across the federal 
government, think tanks, and advocacy organizations.
    Prior to joining Equitable Growth, Mr. Linden served in the 
Biden administration and was a senior advisor and then the 
Executive Associate Director at the White House Office of 
Management and Budget, where he worked on a wide array of 
public policies and was integrably--integr---excuse me, I have 
a cold today--integrally involved in producing the President's 
budget.
    Mr. Linden previously served as the senior advisor on the 
Senate Budget and Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pension 
Committees. Mr. Linden was also the founding executive director 
at the Groundwork Collaborative.
    Dr. Kimberly Clausing is the Eric M. Zolt chair in tax law 
and policy at the UCLA School of Law. Dr. Clausing most 
recently was the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Tax Analysis in 
the U.S. Department of the Treasury, serving as the lead 
economist in the Office of Tax Policy.
    Prior to joining UCLA, Dr. Clausing was the Thormund A. 
Miller and Walter Mintz Professor of Economics at Reed College.
    Dr. Clausing is a non-resident senior fellow at the 
Peterson Institute for International Economics, a member of the 
Council on Foreign Relations, and a research associate at the 
National Bureau of Economic Research. Her research examines how 
government decisions and corporate behavior interplay in the 
global economy.

STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE MICHAEL FAULKENDER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, 
        AMERICA FIRST POLICY INSTITUTE, WASHINGTON, D.C.

    Dr. Faulkender. Chairman Heinrich, Vice Chairman 
Schweikert, members of the committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to testify today on the unsustainable fiscal 
situation facing the United States.
    Part of my responsibility as Assistant Secretary was to 
oversee the crafting of the Social Security and Medicare 
Trustees Reports, so, Mr. Vice Chairman, I very much understand 
the demographic challenges that you mentioned in your opening 
statement.
    In addition to being chief economist at the America First 
Policy Institute, I am also a finance professor at the 
University of Maryland, where I have served for the last 15 
years.
    During my first week at Treasury, I oversaw finalizing the 
2018 Financial Report of the U.S. Government. According to that 
report, U.S. Government debt was projected to rise from 70 
percent of national output to 530 percent by the end of the 75-
year forecast period.
    The interest alone on this scale of debt would dwarf the 
size of the entire Federal Government, including Social 
Security, Medicare, and defense combined. For that reason, we 
renamed the second section of the executive summary from, 
quote, ``Where We Are Headed,'' end quote, to, quote, ``An 
Unsustainable Fiscal Path,'' end quote, a title it still holds 
today.
    When COVID hit, Congress and the Trump administration 
enacted a temporary financial lifeline that sustained 
households and small businesses. Contrast that with the 
beginning of this administration, when, despite the economy 
being nearly fully recovered and with inflation below 2 
percent, the Federal Government enacted trillions of dollars of 
fiscal spending that only stimulated 40-year-high inflation. 
Debt held by the public has risen from nearly $16 trillion at 
the end of fiscal year 2018 to more than $26 trillion at the 
end of fiscal year 2023.
    According to CBO's latest Budget and Economic Outlook, over 
each of the next 10 years, budget deficits are forecast to 
exceed 5 percent of annual national output. And as CBO says, 
quote, ``Since the Great Depression, deficits have exceeded 
that level only during and shortly after World War II, the 
2007-2009 financial crisis, and the coronavirus pandemic,'' end 
quote. It is one thing to temporarily run a large deficit 
during a time of national crisis; it is unsustainable for 
deficits of this scale to be the norm.
    To realize fiscal sustainability, growth is essential. As 
the Laffer curve explains, higher tax rates deter economic 
activity, resulting in potentially less revenue for the 
government, which will not solve our budget, inflation, or 
growth challenges.
    The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is not the cause of our current 
fiscal challenges. After all, in fiscal year 2022, Federal 
receipts were 19 percent of national output, the second-highest 
since World War II, compared to an average of 17 percent for 
the last 75 years.
    Indeed, the problem is that spending has exploded. Federal 
spending has averaged 20 percent of national output in the 50-
year timeframe of 1968 through 2019. It has averaged 25 percent 
the last 3 years, with spending for the next 10 years estimated 
to be in the 23-to-24-percent-of-GDP range.
    Massive spending reductions should start with repealing the 
cynically entitled Inflation Reduction Act. This act unleashes 
an estimated $1.2 trillion in corporate welfare that makes it 
more expensive to manufacture here in the United States, makes 
us more reliant on energy and critical minerals from potential 
adversaries, worsens our Nation's financial position, and does 
not significantly improve the planet's environment.
    Likewise, the student loan forgiveness of this 
administration must stop. If universities offer degrees that 
push radical causes instead of preparing students for high-
paying jobs, the institutions should take losses rather than 
transferring them to taxpayers. Such spending distorts tuition 
costs, encourages worthless degrees, and contributes to 
inflation.
    Much of this spending was conducted without congressional 
approval. This Congress reduced long-term deficits through the 
Fiscal Responsibility Act by $2.6 trillion over the next 10 
years. However, technical changes increased deficits by $1.1 
trillion, including $428 billion arising from how the 
administration implemented energy-related tax provisions of the 
IRA.
    Spending through rulemaking should be approved by Congress, 
rather than the executive branch usurping the powers of the 
purse.
    Additional deficit reductions would arise if government 
benefits helped Americans realize their potential rather than 
permanent dependency; from reducing the bloated government 
bureaucracy; and from increased energy and mining activities on 
Federal lands that would generate significant royalty income.
    Finally, let me say, the impact on the American people of 
higher debt is not limited to a potential economic recession or 
higher future taxes. Rising 30-year mortgage rates have 
resulted in the monthly payment for a $250,000 mortgage rising 
from approximately $1,000 a month in January of 2021 to more 
than $1,600 today. The best way for us to improve access to 
home ownership for young people is to get interest rates back 
down, not to provide subsidies that cause housing 
unaffordability to worsen.
    Thank you for including me in today's important discussion. 
I look forward to answering your questions.
    [The statement of Dr. Faulkender appears in the Submissions 
for the Record.]
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. Thank you.
    Mrs. Boccia.

    STATEMENT OF MRS. ROMINA BOCCIA, DIRECTOR OF BUDGET AND 
      ENTITLEMENT POLICY, CATO INSTITUTE, WASHINGTON, D.C.

    Mrs. Boccia. Chairman Heinrich, Vice Chair Schweikert, and 
members of the committee, thank you for inviting me to testify 
today.
    My name is Romina Boccia, and I am the director of budget 
and entitlement policy at the Cato Institute.
    The views I express in this testimony are my own and should 
not be construed as representing the views of my employer.
    I will make three main points today: First, higher spending 
is driving the growth in the debt. Second, it is the growth in 
Medicare and Social Security spending that is the primary 
driver of the growth in public debt. And, third, slowing the 
growth in spending should be coupled with pro-growth policies 
to secure not only America's fiscal future but also economic 
prosperity.
    Our Nation's debt is growing at an alarming rate, with CBO 
projecting that debt borrowed in credit markets will exceed 170 
percent of GDP in the next 30 years. That is under very 
optimistic assumptions.
    Current fiscal projections threaten Americans with higher 
taxes, reduced economic growth, higher interest rates, stifling 
inflation, and the tail risk of a severe fiscal crisis that 
could exacerbate all these other issues. Even under fantastic 
revenue projections, spending-driven debt growth threatens U.S. 
fiscal stability and Americans' economic security.
    Despite CBO's highly unrealistic projections about tax 
revenues rising by 50 percent over the next 10 years, spending 
will continue to outpace revenues. Baked into CBO's baseline is 
the assumption that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will expire as 
scheduled under current law, when neither political party has 
demonstrated an appetite for allowing that to happen.
    Even taking CBO's 10-year projections at face value, 
comparing them with historical spending and revenue highlights 
the unsustainability of current spending growth. Spending is 
projected to exceed 24 percent of GDP by 2034, compared to a 
50-year average of 21 percent of GDP. Meanwhile, revenues would 
also exceed their historical average of 17.3 percent of GDP, 
but by much less, just shy of 18 percent of GDP.
    Peacetime deficits at these levels, at 6 percent of GDP, 
are too high and cannot be sustained for long.
    What is driving this growth in Federal spending? Federal 
healthcare programs and Social Security are the biggest 
spending growth drivers, alongside increasing debt service 
costs. Healthcare and Social Security are responsible for 
nearly two-thirds of the growth in spending just over the next 
10 years, followed by interest costs.
    Over the 30-year spending window, Social Security, 
healthcare, and interest continue to pose the biggest spending 
pressures, threatening to drive Federal spending to an 
unprecedented 30 percent of GDP, from a 50-year historical 
average of 21 percent of GDP.
    That would be a massive expansion in the size of government 
that could only be financed by higher taxes on all Americans, 
not just the wealthy. There isn't enough money at the very top 
of the income distribution to make that math work.
    As healthcare and Social Security spending balloon as a 
percentage of the economy, every other major budget category 
declines or stabilizes over that same 30-year window.
    Looking out yet further to the Financial Report of the U.S. 
Government, it details how Medicare and Social Security's 
unfunded obligations are responsible for the entire unfunded 
obligation of the Federal Government. That is right: The 75-
year gap between non-interest spending and revenues of close to 
$80 trillion can be attributed to Medicare and Social Security 
alone.
    So the key drivers of rising U.S. deficits and debt are 
obvious. Congress cannot effectively address the short-term or 
long-term growth in the Federal debt without slowing the growth 
in old-age benefit programs and in healthcare spending or 
massively raising taxes on all Americans, bringing the U.S. 
closer to European-style tax levels.
    As Congress seeks to address these problems, legislators 
should not lose sight of preserving the economy's capacity to 
grow. Shortsighted policies that raise taxes on investing and 
work could undermine debt stabilization if such policies dampen 
growth. Spending-based deficit reduction historically, 
especially targeted at social and entitlement programs, is most 
effective at sustainably reducing deficits.
    As bleak as the U.S. fiscal outlook is, there is light at 
the end of the tunnel. The House Budget Committee recently 
passed the Fiscal Commission Act, which seeks to stabilize the 
debt over 15 years, educate the public on the Nation's 
deteriorating fiscal state, and improve the Medicare and Social 
Security Trust Fund's solvency over a 75-year window.
    This is a positive step. It would be even more promising if 
Congress designed a fiscal commission based on the successful 
Base Realignment and Closure Commission, or BRAC, with 
independent experts, Executive involvement, and fast-track 
authority to allow for default adoption of a commission plan.
    Thank you for inviting me to this hearing, and I look 
forward to your questions.
    [The statement of Mrs. Boccia appears in the Submissions 
for the Record.]
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. Thank you.
    Mr. Linden.

    STATEMENT OF MR. MICHAEL LINDEN, SENIOR POLICY FELLOW, 
    WASHINGTON CENTER FOR EQUITABLE GROWTH, WASHINGTON, D.C.

    Mr. Linden. Vice Chair Schweikert, Chair Heinrich, members 
of the committee, thank you so much for this opportunity to 
testify here today.
    I am going to make three important points.
    First, I am going to agree with my colleagues that rising 
debt poses real risks, but I am going to note that those risks 
are inherently uncertain in both timing and magnitude, which is 
why prudent fiscal policy should take a risk-management 
approach.
    Second, there are both good ways and bad ways to manage 
fiscal risks. Policies that support broad-based economic growth 
will help reduce fiscal risks without causing unnecessary harm.
    And, finally, to the extent that fiscal risks have risen in 
the last decade, the primary culprit is, in fact, the tax cuts 
that have dramatically reduced Federal revenues.
    But let's begin where everybody agrees: Debt as a percent 
of our economy cannot rise forever without there eventually 
being some negative consequences. Many economists reasonably 
worry, for example, that an ever-increasing debt load could 
result in higher interest rates or could crowd out private 
investment and lead to slower economic growth, among other 
plausible risks.
    However, there is little to suggest that our current debt 
levels are causing any of these potential harms right now, but 
there is a risk that any or all of them could come to pass in 
the future as debt continues to rise.
    Risks are, however, by definition, uncertain, and it is 
important to approach questions of fiscal sustainability with a 
degree of humility. Projections may be wrong. Fiscal risks have 
been overstated in the past. And there is very little agreement 
or strong evidence on the magnitudes of the risks we actually 
face.
    For example, many economists have long believed that higher 
debt would necessarily mean higher interest rates. But, in 
fact, the observed relationship between publicly held debt and 
interest rates is the opposite of that. Debt rates today are 
still much lower than they were in the 1980s and 1990s, when 
debt was significantly lower than it is today.
    Similarly, a traditional concern is that more government 
spending will crowd out private investment. But the evidence 
for this concern is also quite mixed. Some studies have found a 
significant effect, while others have found almost none. And, 
in fact, recent economic evidence has suggested that there is, 
in fact, a crowding-in effect that can happen, where private 
investors follow the public sector's lead, and total investment 
goes up, not down.
    To be clear, the lesson here is not that there are no risks 
from rising debt, but, rather, that the magnitude of those 
risks from higher debt is really uncertain.
    That is why I believe the prudent course is to take a risk-
management approach. Prudent and responsible governance means 
neither ignoring risks nor making drastic changes to eliminate 
them entirely. It means taking appropriate steps without 
causing unnecessary harm now. After all, it would be a very 
poor swap to trade the uncertainty of potential damage at some 
time in the future for the certainty of major damage today.
    That is why the best way to reduce risk without causing 
harm is to enact policies that promote and accelerate shared, 
broad-based economic growth. After all, we can reduce our debt-
to-GDP ratio by expanding GDP.
    And we know, for example, that investments in early 
childhood--like WIC, for example--and in scientific research 
are going to pay enormous dividends, expanding our economy, and 
make it easier to reduce the risks posed by increasing debt.
    The converse is also true and worth explicitly mentioning: 
Policies enacted in the name of fiscal risk reduction that slow 
or impede growth, either by cutting productive investments or 
by increasing inequality, are not only harmful on their own 
merits but are also likely to fail at their stated goal.
    As we consider risks and how to reduce them, it is valuable 
to understand which policies have in the past increased our 
risks and which have reduced them. Simply put, the primary, if 
not sole, reason that the debt projections are currently rising 
rather than falling is because of tax cuts. If not for the 
series of tax reductions enacted since 2001, the debt as a 
percent of GDP would be on a downward trajectory, not upward.
    In fact, the CBO now projects that total Federal primary 
spending as a percent of GDP will be lower, not higher, than 
what it projected the last time it foresaw debt on a downward 
trajectory. So, if debt is now rising instead of falling and 
spending is lower than expected, then the primary culprit is 
lower-than-expected revenues.
    Healthcare spending, in particular, has grown much more 
slowly than expected, not faster, and CBO now expects that we 
will spend about $5 trillion less over the next 10 years than 
it thought back in 2012, when the debt was projected to be on a 
downward trajectory.
    Those trillions of dollars in savings, however, will be 
more than wiped out by trillions of dollars in tax cuts. CBO 
now expects that revenue will be $15 trillion lower than what 
it expected back in 2012.
    So we may be spending $5 trillion less on healthcare, but 
we are also spending $15 trillion more on tax cuts, roughly 
half of which goes to the top 5 percent of households.
    When I look at that debt trajectory, I do see risk. The 
magnitude of the risk is uncertain, and that should make us 
cautious about taking drastic actions.
    But by employing a risk-management approach, we can see 
that there are prudent steps we can take now without causing 
unnecessary harm, like investing in ways that we know support 
shared growth. And we can begin to reduce the revenue losses 
that are the primary contributor to our fiscal risks by asking 
the wealthy and corporations to pay more in taxes.
    Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.

 STATEMENT OF DR. KIMBERLY CLAUSING, ERIC M. ZOLT CHAIR IN TAX 
       POLICY AT THE UCLA SCHOOL OF LAW, LOS ANGELES, CA

    Dr. Clausing. Chairman Heinrich, Vice Chairman Schweikert, 
members of the committee, thank you for inviting me to share my 
views on the U.S. fiscal situation.
    Today's situation provides important risks but also 
opportunities. In my testimony today, I will make five main 
points.
    First, in an environment of rising deficits and debt, we 
cannot afford to simply extend the many Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
provisions that are due to expire at the end of next year.
    A full extension of the expiring provisions, alongside a 
reversal of the business tax raisers that are built into the 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, would cost more than $4 trillion--or $5 
trillion with interest--over the 2026-to-2035 budget window. 
This would add substantially to already-high estimates of 
deficits.
    Further, extending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions 
disproportionately benefits richer households.
    Second, we should view 2025 as an opportunity to make the 
U.S. tax system better--not just more matched to our fiscal 
needs, but also fairer, more efficient, and more suited to the 
challenges we face.
    For example, in recent decades, income inequality has 
increased, so our tax system might reasonably ask more from 
those whose incomes have soared while helping those that are 
most vulnerable.
    Our tax system can also better focus on efficient sources 
of revenue, such as those that would reach the excess profits 
of large corporations or those that would reduce carbon 
emissions.
    And by working together with partner countries, U.S. tax 
policy can tackle important global collective-action problems, 
such as climate change and tax competition.
    Third, a suite of corporate and international tax reforms 
can meet all of these tax policy goals, boosting revenue, 
enhancing progressivity, increasing efficiency, all while 
reducing the offshoring and profit-shifting incentives that 
have been baked into current law. At the same time, we can work 
with other countries to tackle tax competition.
    A recent analysis showed that, of over 110 countries 
worldwide, the United States is in the bottom 10 percent in 
terms of corporate tax revenue relative to GDP, despite the 
fact that the United States has the world's most profitable 
corporations.
    The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced corporate tax 
revenue substantially, and the act's international tax rules 
encourage both offshoring and profit-shifting. The 2017 tax law 
perversely incentivizes all sources of foreign income relative 
to domestic income, and it also encourages the offshoring of 
plants and equipment. I have long called the 2017 tax law an 
``America last'' tax policy.
    Luckily, reforming the U.S. international tax system is now 
more desirable than ever. Since jurisdictions throughout the 
world are adopting coordinated minimum taxation on the world's 
largest multinational companies, that is reducing tax 
competition pressures. This allows the United States to reform 
our tax system far more easily.
    Fourth, climate tax policy can help achieve both fiscal and 
environmental goals in the time ahead. As a first step, 
repealing existing fossil-fuel subsidies in the Tax Code, as 
consistently proposed in Biden administration Green Books, 
would raise more than $100 billion over the budget window and 
take an important step toward a cleaner Tax Code.
    But even more significant, the emissions reductions 
achieved through the Inflation Reduction Act can be 
turbocharged through the adoption of a modest carbon fee while 
simultaneously protecting households from increases in energy 
and fuel costs and reducing the deficit.
    Consider a carbon fee that begins at only $15 a metric ton, 
rises slowly to $65 by the end of the budget window, and carves 
out retail gasoline. Layered on top of the Inflation Reduction 
Act incentives, such a carbon fee would have minimal effects on 
household energy costs, raising them only about $30 a year, yet 
emissions reductions would be very large, and the fee would 
bring in about $600 billion in revenue. Further, that score 
could be hundreds of billions of dollars higher if exports are 
not rebated at the border.
    A domestic carbon fee would also help us work with partners 
throughout the world on policies to encourage emissions 
reduction worldwide. Collaboration on a nondiscriminatory 
carbon border adjustment mechanism would ensure that any seller 
serving markets with carbon pricing faces an incentive to 
decarbonize alongside the incentives faced by domestic firms. 
This could encourage countries throughout the world to reduce 
emissions.
    Elsewhere, I have laid out other sensible revenue raisers, 
but let me close with one final point. Simply put, we can 
afford to better support workers and families. Toward that end, 
both the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit 
should be expanded.
    Recent expansions in the Child Tax Credit under the 
American Rescue Plan led to the most significant decrease in 
children's poverty in recent decades. But the expiration of 
that expansion reversed those gains. We can afford to invest in 
children and to help the most vulnerable, and those goals 
should be at the centerpiece of our tax policy agenda.
    Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.
    [The statement of Dr. Clausing appears in the Submissions 
for the Record.]
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. [Inaudible.]
    And, yes, I will learn to hit my ``talk'' button.
    Doctor, just off the top of your head, what is the most you 
think we can take in in receipts--revenues? It technically 
should be called receipts. Twenty percent of GDP? What--just 
give me a number.
    Dr. Clausing. If you look at the last time we balanced the 
budget, which was at the turn of the century, we were taking in 
about 20 percent of GDP, and I think that is quite attainable.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. Okay. So you think we can get up 
to the 20. All right.
    Dr. Faulkender, consistently, we have shown that CBO's 
numbers seem to be missing what is actually going on. And it 
is, as Mr. Linden said, you know, the fear of the black swan. I 
will argue, right now it is the white swan. We see it coming, 
but we are not adopting policy sets to deal with that.
    I actually have--and you all know Brian Riedl.
    Dr. Faulkender. Uh-huh.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. You know, one of the papers he 
wrote, what, a couple months ago, basically doing tax 
maximization of everyone over $400,000, everything from income 
to estate to up and down, and then doing some economic effects, 
he was only coming in with about 1\1/2\ percent of GDP.
    How is it possible, then, to get to these numbers? When you 
start saying, we are going to get up to 20--the President's 
budget, I think, is at 20.3 percent of receipts to the size of 
the economy. We have already seen the papers from other 
academics saying you can only pick up another point and a half, 
maybe--if you are optimistic, 2 points--from those over 
$400,000. What am I not understanding?
    And please understand, the run rate on this fiscal year 
right now, if you do total gross borrowing, I think we are 
borrowing close to 9, 9.6 percent of the entire economy.
    What am I not understanding?
    Dr. Faulkender. So, if we look at tax as a percentage of 
GDP since World War II, as was just mentioned, the year 2000 
was the highest on record. And that was because we had a 
massive run-up in the equity markets that gave us some one-time 
capital gains taxes that were not repeatable. The second-
highest was the year 2022, when we realized 19 percent of GDP 
in the form of receipts.
    So, if you were going to only put the top--those making 
above $400,000 on the table as those potentially going to pay 
higher taxes, and you extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for 
everyone below $400,000, as you said, you are coming in with 
another 1 to 1\1/2\ percent of GDP. That doesn't get us to the 
level that you are talking about, which, as I said, is above 
the highest level we have ever seen.
    In order to get to those rates that CBO was projecting 12 
years ago, you have to assume massive increases in middle-class 
taxes from bracket creep that Congress would not have undone. 
If you are going to go after where there is significant 
revenue, you are going to have to go well below $400,000 by not 
inflation-adjusting many of the areas where tax rates get 
modified.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. And I am going to apologize 
because I always screw up. ``Boccia''?
    Mrs. Boccia. Yes. Thank you.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. Is this the argument--and even 
when I read the testimony from our Democrat witnesses, aren't 
we--isn't the reality that, into the decade, you are heading 
towards a VAT tax?
    Mrs. Boccia. That is one possibility, that you raise an 
entirely new level of taxes. I agree with Dr. Faulkender that 
it would require higher taxes on middle-class Americans.
    I think that what we concede here is that, if we believe 
that, on the best prospect, the government could raise about 20 
percent of GDP in revenue, and yet we know that spending is 
projected to grow to 30 percent of GDP in revenue, that we need 
to find spending reductions.
    And there are many ways that we can slow the growth in the 
main drivers of spending growth, which is Medicare and Social 
Security, without cutting benefits for current beneficiaries, 
including indexing initial Social Security benefits to wages, 
at least for higher-income earners, if not for everyone, rather 
than--I mean, to prices rather than wages. And for Medicare, 
there is a lot of opportunity to introduce market forces that 
would provide quality care at lower cost.
    And none of these require benefit cuts to current 
beneficiaries, just slowing the growth of future benefits.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. And I want to first also thank 
you for your support of a debt and deficit commission.
    I think we actually talk around each other often, and we 
don't tell each other the truth. You know, we have had a 
running discussion, and I was sort of saddened that no one 
here--if diabetes is 33 percent of all healthcare spend, 
wouldn't actually taking on some of the afflictions in our 
society actually be one of the most moral and most effective 
ways to actually take on both debt and deficits, family 
formation, economic growth? But because it is not part of our 
talking points, we often never look for--it becomes binary: 
raise taxes, cut spending.
    And the point I wanted to try to make--and tell me if my 
math is wrong. So taxing folks over $400,000, you pick up, 
let's say, another point and a half of GDP. For those of us on 
the cut side, there is a point, point-and-a-half percent, you 
know, without redesigning major entitlement programs.
    And if you have a run rate--look, I know CBO said we are 
going to borrow 5.6 percent of the economy this year, but so 
far the current run rate is over 9 this year. Because with the 
current borrowing at, what, $95,000 a second, we may borrow 
2.8; there is a chance you could get close to--higher than that 
this year, in a time when the economy is healthy.
    And yet we will stick with our political rhetoric, because 
that is what gets us reelected, because God forbid we go home 
and tell people the truth. But it turns out, my revenue raisers 
and my cuts still leave a huge gap.
    And, Mr. Linden, you actually hit one of my favorite 
subjects, and that is, are we heading towards a time, if we 
don't demonstrate certain levels of mitigation--you are heading 
towards the bond market being--and this has happened, you know, 
even during the Clinton administration. The bond market 
hiccuped, and there was almost a sense of panic for a little 
while.
    You keep saying, well, a black swan doesn't have to happen. 
But isn't that the point of it being a black swan, is you don't 
know it is coming?
    Mr. Linden. I think you want to take a prudent approach by 
reducing your risks. That is the way we think about risk in a 
whole host of different areas, and fiscal management should be 
no different.
    We don't know that that is the case. People have been 
saying that is the case for a long time. If you had this 
hearing 20 years ago, they would have said rising debt----
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. Yeah.
    Mr. Linden [continuing]. Is going to create all these----
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. Of course, we also didn't think 
we were going to have a decade of almost free interest rates. 
It is very Taleb-ish.
    Mr. Linden. Right, right. So I think it is important to be 
responsible and to think, okay, there are risks, those risks 
are real, we should take those seriously; how do we prudently 
reduce those risks in ways that don't cause harm now?
    I want to agree with my colleague, Dr. Clausing, that, you 
know, raising corporate rates is probably pro-growth, it is 
probably good for the economy, it is pro-efficiency, it does 
raise revenue. It doesn't reduce the risk all the way to zero. 
I am not sure you need to do that. What you need to do is be 
prudent about this, take it seriously.
    And I want to agree with you very much on the healthcare 
point. You know, we have made some significant progress in the 
last 10 years on reducing healthcare costs.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. And I am way over time, but it is 
fascinating. We actually had a discussion with, I think it was 
Goldman Sachs on even their math they were doing for the 
economy and economic growth in regards to semaglutides. And you 
go, this is a bizarre conversation. But yet how do we ever get 
it into our lexicon that it actually becomes part of our math 
set?
    And, with that, I yield to the chairman.
    Chairman Heinrich. Thank you.
    Dr. Faulkender, one of the places where we may be in 
general agreement that deviates from the conversation on 
revenue and spending for just a moment is the challenges in our 
Nation's demographics. And I think those are things that a lot 
of people are not aware of, just how quickly--in the early 
2030s--we may be shrinking our population in the United States 
if we don't make changes.
    Would you agree that we are not going to solve those 
challenges without a larger pipeline of legal, documented 
immigration?
    Dr. Faulkender. Mr. Chairman, the way that I explain the 
demographic challenge to people is that, for about 40 years, we 
had about 3.3 workers for every senior. We are at about 2.8 
right now, and we are on our way to 2.3.
    The way that our major entitlement programs, major Social 
Security program is structured is that it is cash-flow-neutral 
at about 3. And so, if you go from 3.3 to 2.3, that is a 
massive----
    Chairman Heinrich. Right.
    Dr. Faulkender [continuing]. Shift in demography. If you 
look at the entire population increase----
    Chairman Heinrich. So how do you reverse that?
    Dr. Faulkender. Well, birthrates are going the wrong 
direction.
    Chairman Heinrich. Right.
    Dr. Faulkender. And so, presuming that we continue to see 
expansions in life expectancy, the only way to increase the 
workforce is either to increase labor force participation among 
prime-age workers----
    Chairman Heinrich. Agreed.
    Dr. Faulkender [continuing]. Or immigration.
    Chairman Heinrich. Yeah. And presumably both of those are 
laudable things to try and address the demographic challenges 
with.
    Dr. Clausing, would you say that we are currently taxing--
the way we are taxing individuals across the economy is 
fundamentally fair? In other words, like, who is paying their 
fair share? Who is not? Who maybe is paying, you know, more 
than their fair share? Would you call our individual tax 
structure equitable?
    Dr. Clausing. There are elements of our tax structure that 
are progressive, but there are other elements that are much 
less fair.
    One example would be the treatment of capital income 
relative to labor income. As soon as you earn even $1 of labor 
income, the payroll tax starts, and as you earn more and more, 
you climb up the Federal income tax brackets. But there is a 
lower tax bracket structure for capital gains and dividends. 
And many of those sources of income aren't taxable at all. If 
you hold your asset until death, in fact, you can avoid capital 
gains entirely.
    So our system as a whole really is favoring those who 
inherit income or who have large savings, stocks already 
relative to those who work for their income.
    Chairman Heinrich. Mr. Linden, on a related point, our tax 
code often rewards wealth over work, and it lets the wealthiest 
Americans pay less taxes than teachers and firefighters.
    So how do the economic impacts of the lower capital gains 
rate or the carried interest loophole for hedge fund executives 
compare to some of the benefits from investments that 
presumably help grow our GDP--investments in families through 
things like universal childcare or an expanded Child Tax 
Credit? And how should you weigh those against each other?
    Mr. Linden. That is a great question. Thank you for that 
question.
    You know, for a long time, I think there was an argument 
that lower capital gains taxes would produce more investment or 
more growth and more jobs, and that has not been borne out in 
the economic evidence really at all. That theory persists; 
people still talk about that. But there is almost no empirical 
evidence for it.
    On the other hand, we have a lot of empirical evidence for 
what happens when you invest in early childhood, in 
particular--and many other areas as well, but I will focus on 
early childhood.
    The returns of every single dollar invested in early 
childhood and across a range of things--early-childhood 
education, nutrition, healthcare--those benefits far outweigh 
the costs over time, economically speaking.
    I am always hesitant to--I am always hesitant to claim that 
things pay for themselves, because it is very hard to know over 
time. But if there is anything where the evidence is really 
strong, it is early-childhood education.
    Chairman Heinrich. Dr. Clausing, let me go back to the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act again. How much of an effect would extending 
the provisions of that bill have on the deficit, in your 
estimation?
    And, you know, do you have opinions on what portions we 
should let expire and which, if any, of them we should keep?
    Dr. Clausing. Yeah, so what I did to estimate was to simply 
take CBO numbers and inflate them to the budget window that we 
are looking at. So, assuming this negotiation happens in 2025, 
we are looking at the 2026-to-2035 window.
    And if you look at both the individual extensions for 
everything that is set to expire, including passthrough and 
individual rates and estate taxes, and you also add in business 
reversals--there is a bunch of business tax increases that are 
baked into the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and there is already, in 
fact, a legislative attempt to extend some of those that has 
passed the House of Representatives and is now being considered 
by the Senate. So, if you add those in as well, you are at 
about $4 trillion over 10 years. And if you add interest to 
that, it is more like $5 trillion over 10 years.
    Now, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act did have some features that 
I think are useful that one could keep. For instance, I think 
having a higher standard deduction and a higher Child Tax 
Credit, coupled with the loss of exemptions, is a reasonable 
way to structure the system. Fewer people itemize, it is less 
complicated, and it is a solid reform.
    But there are a lot of parts of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that 
are simply unaffordable to extend or unwise to extend.
    At the top of the list I would put the Section 199A 
deduction, which is complicated, inefficient, also highly 
regressive. More than 50 percent of the benefits go to those in 
the top 1 percent, and the bottom half of the population only 
gets 3 percent of the benefits from that 199A deduction. But, 
also, I don't think we need estate tax cuts that benefit only 
the richest 2 in 1,000 estates.
    And I think we should seriously consider letting the rate 
structure expire as it is, because it is simply an awful lot of 
money that disproportionately, again, benefits those at the 
top, who benefit from every step of that rate structure.
    Chairman Heinrich. Great.
    Thank you all.
    Thank you, Mr. Vice Chairman.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. Thank you.
    Mr. Estes.
    Representative Estes. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And thank you to our witnesses for being here.
    Our Nation is kind of at a tipping point. I mean, we are 
nearly 34.5--or, actually, we are over $34.5 trillion in debt. 
And I count public and intergovernmental debt, not just the 
public, because nobody is going to say that they are not going 
to pay Social Security recipients or not going to pay the 
military retirement. So intergovernmental debt is debt that has 
to be paid by the taxpayers.
    We are currently, as the chairman said, borrowing $95,000 a 
second, roughly. In 2023, the debt increased by $2.6 trillion 
in that 365-day period. And we are on track to be over $36 
billion by a year from now.
    And it is irresponsible spending, really, that has impaired 
the national credibility and is starting to affect the national 
security now, in addition to saddling the next generations with 
a huge burden of debt. We were elected to find legislative 
solutions to the debt crisis in this country, and that means we 
need to rein in reckless government spending and return to 
regular order.
    I want to just mention that, you know, we haven't passed 
all 12 appropriations bills on time since 1996. It is both 
Republicans and Democrats at fault. Omnibus spending and even 
the minibus spending, although a step in the right direction, 
continues to keep this body in a never-ending spiral of 
spending more money, with these bloated spending bills.
    And on our side of the aisle, my colleagues and I tend to 
try to balance our budget in 10 years. We focused on that with 
the Budget Committee and the work there. But since I have been 
here, in the last almost 7 years, we can't--it is more and more 
difficult to accomplish that in a 10-year window.
    Yesterday's budget released by President Biden just pushes 
us further down the wrong path. I mean, if we think our debt is 
now--if we follow the plan proposed by the President, which 
even includes tax increases, our national debt would be $52.7 
trillion in 10 years.
    Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit for the record my op-
ed entitled, ``Three Ways to Treat America's Debt Pandemic.''
    In it, I outline it is not just our national debt--but that 
is a problem--but that household debt has also reached a high 
of $17.5 trillion this year.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. So ordered.
    [The Op-Ed submitted by Representative Estes appears in the 
Submissions for the Record.]
    Representative Estes. Families are struggling to pay their 
debt because of inflation and because of--taking on credit card 
and other debt is only exacerbating that national fiscal 
crisis.
    Dr. Faulkender, it seems like there are correlations 
between personal finances and our national fiscal situation. 
The inflation from Bidenomics has created a terrible economy 
for working families. They have taken on more debt and are 
facing higher interest rates, while at the same time the 
Federal Government is spending more than it is bringing in and 
having to figure out how to pay higher interest rates on its 
debt.
    What are some of the public policies that have caused this? 
And how do you think--or is there a relationship between 
personal and national finances?
    Dr. Faulkender. Sure.
    So, if we think about the economy that was in place in 
January of 2021, we were seeing a nice recovery from the 
pandemic. We had recovered--by the middle of 2021, we had 
returned to both the economic output prior to the pandemic and 
the level of employment.
    And yet, at the beginning of the Biden administration, an 
additional $2 trillion of fiscal stimulus was thrown into an 
economy that was largely already recovered.
    And so, as a result, we saw inflation here in the United 
States take off much faster than elsewhere around the world, 
coupled with an administration who singularly focused on 
reducing the ability of the United States to be energy-
independent, to take energy resources offline. We saw that the 
energy sector didn't recover until 2023, despite the rest of 
the economy in 2021.
    So all of those things stimulated demand at a time that we 
were curtailing the ability of the U.S. economy to fulfill that 
demand. The natural result is inflation.
    Now, the Federal Reserve then came in late to the party in 
order to try to curtail some of the excess--you know, the 
really low-interest-rate environment that was in place. And, in 
order to catch up, they increased interest rates extremely 
quickly. We saw mortgage interest rates go from about 3 to 
about 7 percent.
    So, not only are American households now facing 30-percent 
higher energy prices, 20-percent higher food prices, but the 
interest rate on a 30-year mortgage has, as I said, taken a 
$250,000 mortgage from about a $1,000-a-month principal and 
interest payment to over $1,600.
    And the lowest-income amongst us are the ones that are hit 
hardest by it, because shelter, energy, and food comprise a 
much larger portion of their consumption than any other 
demographic.
    Representative Estes. Yeah. I am just so concerned about--
as you mentioned, inflation is such a burden for so many 
individuals, and we have to get that under control. We have to 
have good fiscal policy and not excessively spending over our 
revenue that brings that in.
    And speaking about revenue, I just want to say one quick 
comment, Mr. Chairman, is that I do want to correct the record 
on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We have consistently brought in 
more tax revenue than what the Congressional Budget Office 
estimated after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed. In 2023, 
we saw almost $300 billion more in tax revenue than what had 
been estimated by the CBO. In 2022, it was over $900 billion. 
And, in 2020, it was over 200--roughly $280 billion.
    So the revenue is coming in because the economy is moving. 
And that is one of the things that we have to keep in mind as 
we look at having good pro-growth policies.
    Thank you, and I yield back.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. Thank you, sir.
    Ms. Porter.
    Representative Porter. Dr. Clausing, I wanted to ask you 
about what you referred to as ``America last'' tax policy. And 
so, specifically, I wanted to probe two points of this.
    One is, related to footnote 6, if you want to get really 
technical. You say, early evidence suggests that the Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act's incentives created increased foreign investment, 
which I think would be the opposite of making America great 
again. It would actually be helping our foreign competitors.
    Can you tell me more about that evidence?
    Dr. Clausing. Yes, absolutely.
    So there are two features of the international provisions 
in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that encourage offshoring and 
profit-shifting. One is a 50-percent discount for foreign 
income relative to U.S. income. And the second is an exemption, 
completely free of U.S. tax, for the first 10-percent return on 
foreign assets.
    If you think about those two in concert, they lead to 
incentives to both move plants and equipment offshore, because 
then the first 10-percent return will be completely free of 
tax--which isn't true, you know, here in the United States--and 
to book as much as profit as possible offshore, where it will 
get a 50-percent discount.
    And it is actually a little more perverse than that, 
because even if you have income in a high-tax country offshore, 
or at least a medium-tax country offshore, you can use the 
foreign tax credits from that income, combine it with your 
income in haven jurisdictions, and still get to half the U.S. 
rate. So you would rather have income in France or Japan; then 
you would have it in the United States too, because it will 
generate those foreign tax credits to offset tax due on lower-
tax jurisdictions like Switzerland.
    Representative Porter. So I represent about 700,000 
Americans. How do they benefit from increased foreign 
investment?
    Dr. Clausing. There are benefits to international capital 
and international trade, and I have written a whole book about 
that. But I don't think we want a tax system that puts a thumb 
on the scale in favor of the foreign, relative to the domestic, 
right? We also benefit from having these investments here at 
home and from jobs and the other things that go with plants and 
equipment, right?
    So, when you are looking at, kind of, like, the bang for 
the buck of what we got from all those corporate tax cuts, I 
think that money would have been much better spent on some of 
the investments that Mr. Linden referred to, like the early-
childhood education.
    Representative Porter. My second question is about 
competition policy, which has been a big focus of the Biden 
administration.
    My colleagues on both sides of the aisle love to talk about 
small business and how they are pro- small and medium business.
    How does the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act affect competition 
policy? In other words, the corporate tax base is very 
concentrated, so when we reduce corporate taxes, who gets 
helped among businesses, and who gets hurt?
    Dr. Clausing. Yeah. That is a really interesting point, and 
I am glad you asked that question.
    Because one unappreciated fact is just how concentrated 
that corporate tax base is. There are about a half-million C-
corp payers in the United States, and less than one-half of 1 
percent of them, fewer than 2,000, account for 90 percent of 
the tax base, approximately.
    So, if you look at where all of that tax revenue went, it 
mostly went to just a small handful of companies. About 300 of 
them account for 70 percent of the tax base. And those are 
companies that disproportionately have very high profits, have 
market power, and have multinational operations. So they can 
even self-help themselves to a much lower rate than the U.S. 
domestic rate by moving profit offshore.
    Representative Porter. So our current corporate tax policy 
favors the very largest corporations, and they get about--the 
top 300 corporations are about 70 percent----
    Dr. Clausing. Right.
    Representative Porter [continuing]. Of the tax base.
    So I guess my question is, again, why would we have that 
tax policy? How would an ordinary American who might want to 
start a business be helped by this?
    Dr. Clausing. I think there is a strong argument for 
treating the largest companies differently than the smaller 
companies, in part because I think they are less likely to be 
incentivized by things like investment incentives, because they 
already have all the money they need to do all of these 
investments.
    I think we have it backwards right now, in that we are 
giving the biggest companies a lighter tax burden than the 
smallest companies in a lot of ways. And I think that shoring 
up the international tax system is the first step to fixing 
that. Because if you try to just do it all through the domestic 
system, the big guys can still move the income offshore.
    Representative Porter. Uh-huh.
    Dr. Clausing. So the first step, fix the international, and 
then you can fix the corporate rate structure after that.
    Representative Porter. I will just close by observing that 
the first time I came across the phrase ``GILTI''--which is G-
I-L-T-I in tax world--I was sort of struck by the fact that it 
is called ``GILTI,'' which is what the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
is. It is guilty of creating a tax system that benefits the 
largest corporations over the smallest ones and benefiting 
corporations over American workers.
    I yield back.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. Mr. Arrington.
    And thank you, Mr. Smucker, for helping with his schedule.
    Mr. Arrington. I owe you one, classmate.
    So I didn't plan on delving into tax policy, although I 
think it is important when we are looking at the prospects of 
staving off a debt crisis and growing the economy--which, 
reducing spending and growing the economy, tax policy is 
inevitably and should be a conversation. But I think we have to 
get the facts right here. And I am not sure I am--I am not sure 
the facts, as I have heard them, line up.
    As a Ways and Means Committee member, we brought in record 
revenue to the Treasury after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
    Dr. Faulkender, is that correct?
    Dr. Faulkender. Yes.
    Mr. Arrington. We saw record--record--R&D investment and 
capital, trillions, flowing from overseas to this country. And 
do you know why? Because we had the highest corporate tax rates 
in the free world and the not-so-free world. Like, Communist 
China had lower corporate tax rates than the United States of 
America.
    Listen, it is not the gospel of Jesus for me to suggest 
that a tax rate is at one point or another. But I can tell you 
this, just from west Texas common sense: We cannot grow this 
economy and we cannot have our job creators in the United 
States be competitive if we have the highest tax rates in the 
world. Now, I would hope we could all agree on that, regardless 
of where we negotiate the right place.
    We are not even in--I don't even know that we are in the 
top quartile. Maybe we are. I think we are more in the middle 
now and not dead-last.
    And it is amazing, what TCJA did. Was it perfect? No. Like 
I said, I am not dogmatic about it. But the lower rates for 
individuals benefited the lowest-income families and 
individuals. That is a proven fact. The people who benefited on 
the individual tax rate side were those at the lower end.
    Representative Arrington. And here is another fact: The Tax 
Code is more progressive after TCJA than it was before. It is 
more progressive. We have more people at the higher income 
paying more taxes than at the lower income and more people 
paying no taxes than there were before.
    That is just the fact. It may be inconvenient. But it is 
also probably inconvenient that after TCJA and we reduced the 
tax burden on American families and job creators that we had 
the lowest poverty rates in recorded history.
    Do you know that, Dr. Clausing, that we had the lowest 
poverty rates after we reduced taxes in this country on our 
working families and on businesses? Yes or no, do you agree 
that we achieved the lowest poverty rates?
    Dr. Clausing. Poverty rates were going down in part because 
of the macro economy. But I think even the American Enterprise 
Institute analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would disagree 
with you on several of the points you just raised.
    Representative Arrington. Okay. I am not asking about 
several points. But the poverty rate was at record low after 
TCJA. We had record corporate revenue to the Treasury. We had 
the lowest unemployment rate for women and minorities.
    These are all facts that happened I think in large part 
because of pro-growth policies from the previous 
administration, not all related to tax cut but America First 
trade, deregulation, and the combination of those things--
including, by the way, incentivizing people who are able to 
work to work, not people who are not, not people who can't, but 
those who can work should work.
    Because one of the big constraints for growth is a labor 
shortage, which is a whole nother conversation. But we are 
certainly not going to solve that when we are paying people 
more to stay home than to go back to work. And that is 
certainly what happened during ARPA and some of my Democrat 
colleagues and their policies whether they intended that or 
not.
    Listen, I don't know a single person in this country that I 
have talked to, who is well-informed, who believes that the 
level of indebtedness record for this country, that the fiscal 
path in terms of deficits and the projections from CBO of $120 
trillion on top of the 34 believe this is sustainable and are 
not terrified at the prospect of a debt-related crisis.
    Not any objective or serious person believes that, 
including our Democrat witness from our Fiscal State of the 
Union in this very room, Mark Zandi from Moody's Analytics, and 
other nonpartisans, like our Comptroller General, who worked 
under both Democrat and Republican.
    Every one of them said--and, granted, Democrats have a 
different set of solutions and strategies. There is probably 
some middle ground. And then we have ours.
    But no one--and I am sorry, Mr. Chairman, I will end with 
this--no one thought that we were okay, that we could sustain 
the level of deficits and debt, and that there wouldn't be a 
payday some day and one that would be irreparable and even 
catastrophic.
    I haven't met anybody in this hearing room, at that dais, 
that witness table, saying anything to the contrary.
    With that, I yield back. I apologize.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. Mr. Beyer.
    Representative Beyer. Thank you, Chairman Schweikert. Thank 
you for calling this meeting. And a very important topic.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. Thank you for showing up.
    Representative Beyer. Yeah.
    I would like to first agree with my friend, Mr. Arrington, 
that this is an enormous concern. And I don't know that all of 
us share it, but I have been worried about the deficit for a 
long time. And it has only gotten worse and worse and worse.
    I do want to point out that the lowest poverty rate 
happened after COVID when we spent $800 billion on unemployment 
insurance, we did economic impact payments, we did PPP loans 
where businesses throughout the world were held harmless and 
often made millions and millions of dollars, and we got child 
poverty down to 5.2, 5.3. And then most of those went away, and 
it went back up to 12.7.
    But government funding was a huge part of that. It was also 
a pretty huge part of all the money that corporations were 
paid, again, because they had unprecedented profits as the 
profit margins were tripling and quadrupling.
    As a car dealer, I can tell you ours tripled and quadrupled 
here, too. But that is neither here nor there. I didn't come to 
beat up on the TCJA.
    But I do want to thank Dr. Clausing for always being so 
good to us, for your service in the administration, in and out.
    But we do have, because the TCJA is expiring, we have the 
opportunity to fix a bunch of things, including a corporate tax 
rate which could easily have been 26.5 and gotten almost all of 
the gains that we had before.
    Specifically, though, we had a great Ways and Means dinner 
last night with the Dems side on Pillar Two and trying to 
understand that. And we regularly hear from corporations that 
they want to preserve a Tax Code that is competitive relative 
to the rest of world.
    Dr. Clausing, wouldn't complying with an international 
agreement that creates a floor on global corporate tax rates 
everywhere, including the Caymans and Cypress--I won't--I am 
not going to pick on wonderful countries like Switzerland--stop 
the race to the bottom and give the U.S. greater freedom to 
design tax policy, not to compete with Zug, but actually to 
reflect our priorities?
    Dr. Clausing. Absolutely. I really appreciate that 
question.
    For a long time when we were trying to address the profit 
shifting and offshoring features of current law, people would 
argue, well, you can't do that because some other country will 
obviously undercut us and our U.S. firms will lose out to 
others in merger and acquisition bids.
    But lo and behold, we now have this international agreement 
coming into effect throughout the world that already covers 
more than 90 percent of the in-scope multinational companies 
that raises the bottom from zero to 15 percent.
    That gives countries like the United States a lot more 
freedom to address these longstanding problems without worrying 
about these competitiveness concerns, and it is exactly what 
the business community has been asking for a long time to help 
level that playing field.
    Representative Beyer. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Linden, you talk a lot about risk management, which is 
a wonderful way to think about this.
    I believe we should move towards fixing this budget 
deficit. But when you figure that 80 percent of it is things 
that every American wants, that even people like Donald Trump 
say you can't touch, and we don't want to touch the military.
    So we are looking at 8 to 10 percent of the budget to try 
to fix a problem that is much larger than that, especially 
because all that is sort of investment in our kids and things 
like that.
    So we turn to revenues. And that, of course, is my problem 
with my dear Republican friends, is they won't look at it. The 
President had it in his billionaires minimum income tax, which 
Steve Cohen and I have been co-leading. And he talks about 
other things, step-up in basis, moving gift tax rates to where 
they were before, moving estate tax rates to where they were 
before.
    But my Republican friends will say, no, no, the wealthy job 
creators won't be able to create jobs anymore.
    How do you see that from a risk management framework?
    Mr. Linden. Yeah, I appreciate that question.
    I want to make two points.
    One is that it is true that, as some of my colleagues said, 
that spending on things like Social Security and Medicare have 
gone up over time as the population has aged. We have talked 
about that a little bit in this hearing.
    And those are commitments that we have made to America's 
seniors that are, A, popular. As you said, every--broad 
bipartisan support for those policies. They work. They reduce 
poverty. They reduce senior precarity. They are popular for a 
reason.
    And, critically, we used to have a Tax Code that was able 
to finance the increase in costs. And instead of maintaining 
that Tax Code or building on it, we cut taxes repeatedly. And 
that is why now, even though those costs are rising, the debt 
is now rising with it.
    It didn't have to be this way. We could have chosen to 
simply finance those commitments the way we were before.
    Now we are in a bigger hole, and we have to dig our way out 
of it. But the first thing you do when you are in a hole is 
stop digging. So stop cutting taxes for people at the top.
    And that leads me to my second point, which is, look, at 
the end of the day, where does economic growth come from? Does 
it come from the titans of industry sitting in boardrooms 
deciding how many jobs they are going to create in a day? No, 
it doesn't. It comes from customers. It comes from workers. It 
comes from families doing their best from day to day. And that 
is where you want to invest.
    That is why we see the evidence that we do that investing 
in middle-class families and low-income families produces 
broad-based economic growth. It doesn't come from giving tax 
cuts to people at the very top.
    Representative Beyer. Yeah.
    And, Mr. Chairman, just for 10 seconds, Dr. Faulkender was 
nodding his head no on the tax increase. So I just want to say 
that, as somebody who has kept the dealership books since 1975, 
I remember figuring tax rates out at 75 percent until we got to 
1986. Somehow we kept growing and surviving. So they have gone 
way, way, way down from where they used to be.
    I yield.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. Okay. We won't do a whole 
discussion of effective rates, which is another thing.
    Mr. Smucker, thank you for your patience.
    Representative Smucker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    A fascinating discussion. And, in fact, the chairman 
mentioned a fiscal commission. I think this would be exactly 
what a fiscal commission should be doing, is trying to come up 
with a shared set of facts and beliefs that we all can agree 
upon, because there are things mentioned here today that I 
think probably most of us agree.
    Our birthrate and our demographics will not work for a 
growing economy going forward. We are going to have to increase 
the workforce participation rate and/or increase immigration 
because we are going to need the workers to pay into the 
system. So I completely agree with that.
    Mr. Linden, you mentioned that one of the important 
components of changing the debt-to-equity ratio is growing the 
economy. And so, I completely agree, we have got to figure out 
the right policies to grow the economy. So this is exactly the 
kind of discussion that we should be having.
    I was surprised, Mr. Linden, that your perception of the 
debt is different than many that we hear, and I would like to 
just explore that a little, because this is sort of a 
fundamental fact base, if you will, or a problem that we have 
to agree on.
    My perception is the debt is projected to grow--the debt to 
GDP is going to grow according to CBO to almost 200 percent in 
the next 30, 50 years, 172 percent, I think, in the next 30 
years.
    Your quote, and I have read your testimony as well, but you 
said here you think the evidence of high debt being a problem 
is mixed. So are you not concerned?
    I mean, as far as we can see, revenues are on a certain 
line and even if we make changes to revenue. And then spending 
is another one. So the gap is going to continue to increase. 
You don't think that is a legitimate concern?
    Mr. Linden. Oh, I do think it is a legitimate concern.
    Representative Smucker. Yeah. Okay.
    Mr. Linden. I think risks--
    Representative Smucker. At what level?
    Mr. Linden. Well, that is the question, right? Risks are 
different than certainties. And if you had asked people 10 
years ago, they would have said 90 percent of GDP, that is 
going to be--that is the threshold. If we are there, then 
things fall apart. And that turned out to not be true. And if 
you had asked people before that, they would have given you a 
different number.
    And I think the point that I really want to make is we 
should, instead of saying we are definitely headed for a 
calamity and, therefore, willing to do anything we can to avoid 
that calamity, we should take the risks seriously, look at what 
the evidence actually says.
    Does higher debt inevitably lead to higher interest rates? 
The answer to that question is no by our historical experience.
    Could it lead to higher interest rates? Yes. And that is 
why we need to be thoughtful about these.
    Representative Smucker. Are you concerned about a possible 
sovereign debt crisis at some point? And what I am talking 
about is where people no longer--people buying treasuries no 
longer believe that the U.S. has the ability to repay, and so 
they stop buying treasuries.
    I mean, that would be--first of all, you agree that would 
be a calamity?
    Mr. Linden. That would be very bad.
    Representative Smucker. Yeah. Are you concerned about that?
    Mr. Linden. I think the way that we want to reduce the risk 
of something like that happen to be clear. No evidence we are 
on the cusp of that or anything like that.
    Representative Smucker. Yeah.
    Mr. Linden. But it is a risk, and we should take risks 
seriously. And like we do in any other area of our life, we 
should measure those risks based on how likely they, how big 
they are.
    Representative Smucker. I wish we had more time, and I 
would love to give the two of you a chance.
    And what I am looking for--and I don't know if either of 
you can point me in the right direction--I don't know if you 
all have read Ray Dalio's book. I don't know.
    But, like, there are plenty of examples of countries and 
empires that have risen and fallen. And my perception at least 
is often it is because of their fiscal policies. You had the 
British empire for centuries. You had the Dutch empire. And 
they are gone. And I am concerned this could happen to America.
    Have any of you looked at history and tried to extrapolate, 
like, where we are and where we are headed if we don't change 
course?
    I mean, Mr. Linden, you obviously aren't as concerned.
    But I would be interested in hearing from the two of you, 
as well.
    Dr. Faulkender. So, Congressman, my read of the literature 
on the 90 percent figure is that countries have not had 
financial crises, debt crises below 90 percent of GDP, debt-to-
GDP ratios, that they have all occurred above 90.
    Now, it does not mean that once you hit 90 you hit a debt 
crisis. It just says that is where that happens. Japan has been 
above 200 percent for a while, but Japan has a much higher 
savings rate.
    Now, the U.S. has the world's reserve currency which means 
that our threshold is going to be higher. The challenge that we 
have that is we don't know where the threshold is and it will 
be a moment--it will be a crisis of confidence moment and you 
don't know what is going to spark that.
    I testified a couple of months ago with a former Treasury 
colleague who now runs the Penn Wharton Budget Model, and his 
testimony was that we don't know when, but 20 years from now 
there will be no interest rate that will clear the Treasury 
bond market--at the best 20 years from now.
    I don't want to find out what that looks like, and that 
means we need to get our fiscal house in order today.
    Mrs. Boccia. If I can just add one point.
    One of the risks is that we might end up in a scenario 
where we have what is so-called fiscal dominance where the 
Federal Reserve no longer makes policy based on containing 
inflation but on the basis of supporting the Treasury in 
continuing to finance government spending, should it become 
difficult to borrow from bond markets.
    And there what you are looking at is we had a fairly recent 
experience with that, very high rates of inflation, recurring 
bouts of inflation, which create uncertainty in the market and 
cause a lot of harm and pain for exactly the types of 
populations that can bear that risk the least, which is why I 
think that it is very encouraging that Congress is advancing 
the idea of a fiscal commission to have those discussions 
before a fiscal crisis or another unexpected calamity forces 
legislators' hands.
    Representative Smucker. I am apparently out of time. But 
thank you. Maybe we aren't as far apart as initially we would--
it sounded.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. You are out of time.
    Representative Smucker. Yeah, I know. I am out of time. 
Thank you.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. Have at it.
    Representative Trone. Mr. Smucker, you are out of time.
    Thank you, Vice Chairman Schweikert, staff. Thank you, 
everybody, for being here today.
    The latest CBO budget forecast held debt for the public to 
increase from 99 percent GDP in 2024; 116 percent is the 
groundwork by 2034.
    What is important to acknowledge, that these trends are not 
set in stone. What can we do? The American people are 
dependent, each and all of us, to come together, find 
solutions. We have to increase revenue, and we have to extend 
the solvency of social supports. Of course, we have to yield 
good returns.
    So we can by, one, I think, reforming our immigration 
system. Mr. Smucker touched on it. Two, making the ultra 
wealthy and corporations pay their fair share. And, three, 
increasing workers' ability, as was mentioned, to join our 
labor force, boost revenue, balance the budget for the long 
term.
    This leads me to my first question.
    Mr. Linden, the Penn Wharton Budget Model, which I am 
pretty familiar with having been involved in it from the 
beginning, states that exempting applicants with advanced STEM 
degrees from employment-based green card caps, exempting them 
from those caps would reduce the Federal budget deficit by $129 
billion over 10 years.
    The CBO then projects 5 million more immigrants--I love 
immigration--5 million more immigrants would add an additional 
$1 trillion to our tax revenue over 10 years. That is real 
money.
    Can you speak to the impact that would--this reform would 
have on our labor force and revenue and how this could drive 
our local and national economies, protect Social Security, 
Medicare, Medicaid for generations?
    Mr. Linden.
    Mr. Linden. That is a great question.
    Look, I think we should ground ourselves in some basic 
facts, which is that right now we have the highest labor force 
participation rate in the United States for prime age workers 
that we have seen in 20 years.
    And we have talked about some of our demographic 
challenges. We know that those are real. And they don't have to 
be challenges. They just are what they are. The American people 
as a whole are getting older.
    And we can help expand our economy with more workers. That 
can come through, as we talked about, higher birth rates, but 
also through legal immigration.
    And so that is why the CBO says what it says about 
immigration being really good for our fiscal future.
    I do want to make the point, I want to double-click on the 
point you said, which is, look, what creates growth in this 
country? Growth does not come from the top. It comes from 
entrepreneurs. It comes from workers. It comes from families.
    And when we attract the highest talent, highest skilled 
people from all over the world to the United States, that is 
good for everybody. That is going to raise wages. It creates 
jobs. It creates more growth. And it does create more revenue 
into the Treasury to help us with our fiscal risks.
    Representative Trone. How many immigrants do we take in a 
year on average? Is it about a million, a million a year?
    Mr. Linden. Sorry. Repeat the question.
    Representative Trone. How many immigrants are we bringing 
in for the last 20-some years, legal immigrants?
    Mr. Linden. I would have to go back and check the question.
    Representative Trone. It is about a million a year.
    Mr. Linden. I am going to trust you.
    Representative Trone. What would happen if we took that 
number to 5 million immigrants and we did that every year? 
Maybe that would reduce pressure on the border if we processed 
those folks at their country of origin, so that would, like, 
originally they could go in their own country, consulate, an 
embassy, et cetera, 1 million to 5 million.
    Any thoughts?
    Mr. Linden. I would want to defer that question to true 
immigration experts. I do not consider myself that.
    What I will say is that, look, when we want to think about 
reducing our fiscal risk we need to expand the economy. We need 
to invest in things that grow the economy. We know that having 
more workers, more businesses, higher wages----
    Representative Trone. So you are saying the best way to do 
that, the best single way to do that would be more immigration, 
legal immigration?
    Mr. Linden. I wouldn't want to say that that is----
    Representative Trone. We are not going to move the birth 
rate. The birth rate is not moving. You can't get that done.
    Mr. Linden. I think the----
    Representative Trone. What else you got? I got nothing 
else.
    Mr. Linden. I mean, you could invest in early childhood 
education, too. But those things aren't--we shouldn't pit those 
things against each other. We can do both of those things.
    Representative Trone. Okay. Thank you.
    Baseline tax cuts, loopholes, corporations, wealthy, ultra 
wealthy, definitely damaging our Nation's fiscal health, 
devastating families. A public school teacher might pay a 
higher tax rate than someone that makes a significant amount of 
money. That is wrong.
    Dr. Clausing, could you talk about quickly Bush tax cuts, 
the Trump tax scam, and their extensions, how their extensions 
have impacted the economy?
    Dr. Clausing. Yes, absolutely.
    We haven't seen either of those lead to a big boost in 
growth or really any discernible booth in growth or investment. 
And certainly it has reduced corporate tax revenues in the case 
of the Trump tax cuts and revenues writ large in both 
instances. So there is no evidence that that has really been a 
wise investment of fiscal dollars.
    And just on the immigration front, too, I will agree with 
you that I think this is an incredibly important thing to do 
and that if you look at the share of new businesses and Fortune 
500 companies that are founded by immigrants, you are going to 
get not just labor force participation, but you are going to 
get entrepreneurship, innovation, and growth.
    Representative Trone. Forty percent founded by----
    Dr. Clausing. Yeah.
    Representative Trone [continuing]. Immigrants or the next 
generation. Apple, Google, eBay.
    Dr. Clausing. Yeah.
    Representative Trone. The list never ends. Immigrants 
create tens of millions of jobs.
    Thank you. I yield back.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. Thank you.
    Doctor.
    Representative Ferguson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I thank each of you for being here.
    I am going to start with a very simple question.
    How many of you sitting at this table have opened a small 
business and operated it for more than a decade?
    I got you down there, Don.
    How many of you have worked back in rural districts in a 
small business?
    Dr. Clausing. I have worked in one, but I haven't founded 
one.
    Representative Ferguson. You haven't founded one. So all 
right.
    So the reason I am asking that question is we are talking 
about some really big stuff here. And there is a lot of room 
for debate on that. But I am going to go back to what works and 
what is not working in our small business community right now.
    Inflationary pressures are incredible. Regulatory burdens 
and how they are enforced in a very prescriptive manner are 
crushing to the small business community.
    These are businesses that are innovating. These are 
businesses that are creating jobs. And this is where the next 
great idea always comes from, is somebody's small business in a 
garage.
    And what we keep doing with a lot of these policies is 
making our economy bigger in terms of the participants in the 
economy versus making it work for smaller businesses, and 
particularly those in rural areas.
    So I want to really emphasize how important it is right now 
that we form this debt commission and where we work in a 
bipartisan manner to really get to a really good set of facts 
that we can then begin to make really good decisions on.
    We argue all the time about this policy is better, that 
policy is better. I am going to give you one example.
    How many of you think that we should be making decisions on 
the CBO score? The Congressional Budget Office scoring of when 
we do policy, how many of you think that we should actually be 
using that number as the basis for our decision?
    Okay. It is wildly wrong. If you take a CBO score and go 
out 10 years, it is wrong every time in their 10-year estimate, 
almost every single time. They use static scoring instead of 
dynamic scoring.
    Let me give you a perfect example. On paper, if you look at 
the Affordable Care Act, it said that we would have better 
access, better utilization, better outcomes, and lower costs. 
Well, let's look at where we are based off of CBO scoring.
    The first question is, is America healthier now than it was 
a decade ago? By every metric, the answer is no.
    Are costs up or down? Costs are up.
    We may have better access, but do we have better 
utilization of the system? The answer is no.
    If you look at the CBO scoring as it relates to the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act, we had greater than expected revenues coming 
in from that.
    Does anybody argue with that?
    Mr. Linden. I think that is not right.
    Representative Ferguson. You don't think it is right.
    Mr. Linden. No, it is not.
    Representative Ferguson. So we have record revenues coming 
in.
    Mr. Linden. No.
    Representative Ferguson. Okay.
    Mr. Linden. Last year's revenues were 16.5 percent of GDP. 
It is worth noting, yes, of course, in the year before that, 
there was a record year, but that was, as my colleague noted, 
kind of an aberration, 16.5 percent of GDP was the revenue. 
That is one of the lowest in recent history.
    In 2000, before the Bush tax cuts and the Trump tax cuts, 
it was 20 percent.
    Representative Ferguson. How do you factor in inflation 
into the GDP? Does that skew it at all?
    Mr. Linden. No, it doesn't, because it is the nominal 
amount of revenue raised divided by the nominal GDP. It is 16.5 
percent.
    Representative Ferguson. All right.
    Dr. Faulkender, do you think we should be doing things from 
a business standpoint that encourage investment here 
domestically, that encourage research and development here 
domestically? And do you think we should make every effort to 
transfer wealth from around the world to the U.S.?
    Dr. Faulkender. I think we should be creating a business 
environment that is competitive globally. And so this where I 
am going to just greatly disagree with some of the other 
panelists, because if you look at the pre-TCJA world, if you 
operated a business here in the United States, you 
contemporaneously paid a 35 percent corporate income tax rate. 
In TCJA, we brought that down to 21 percent.
    If you operate a multinational, you were able to 
essentially, especially if you are a significant intellectual 
property firm, you are able to move the royalties from 
intellectual property over to a tax haven country and 
essentially evade corporate income tax--avoid corporate income 
tax on it.
    And so by implementing GILTI, we took the tax rate on 
foreign IP profits from essentially zero up to 11 percent.
    So it seems to me that, prior to TCJA, it was 35 for a 
small company located here in the United States, or a domestic 
company doing something here, versus essentially zero. Instead 
of 35 versus zero, it went to 21 versus 11. That encouraged 
domestic activity, not discourage.
    Representative Ferguson. Mr. Chairman, may I make one--I 
know my time is expired. May I make one more--ask one more 
question?
    We are in this battle right now. If you are running a 
business, particularly a small business, there is limited 
revenue stream. You can do elastic pricing models, you can 
raise prices to a certain point, but then consumers cannot 
afford that.
    You have got to create headroom in there for a business to 
operate, to be creative, to take risks, to make investments.
    Would anybody on this panel, if the answer is raising 
taxes, would you simultaneously be willing to greatly reduce 
the regulatory burden, not necessarily the goals of what you 
want the regulation to be but the prescriptive nature in which 
those regulations are applied to multinationals, as well as 
small businesses?
    Dr. Clausing. I think there is room for streamlining some 
regulations. But I wouldn't take them to zero. I think they 
serve a very useful purpose in some. But there is room to 
streamline, yeah.
    Representative Ferguson. Thank you. Thank you for your 
indulgence, Mr. Chairman.
    I yield back.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. Well, that was interesting.
    Do I have anyone with a particular passion for another 
question before I do?
    Representative Trone. Thanks for the warning.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. Mr. Beyer, something quick.
    Representative Beyer. Just a quick thing, to pull on Dr. 
Ferguson.
    Yes, if we could get the 16.5 percent back up to the 20 
that it was back 20 years ago when George W. Bush was 
President. We have to be open to spending cuts and to 
regulatory reform, absolutely.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. I really wish we would use the 
language ``smart regulation.'' The reality is the world of 
technology we live in today, the way we do much of our 
regulation is absurd. It is a 1938 design model when you could 
crowdsource much of what we do.
    But, then again, no one has ever watched the YouTube video 
I did on--I did this great cartoon on how to use technology.
    I do want to--the prerogative of getting to sit in the 
bigger chair, I have a handful of things I just want to touch 
on.
    Mr. Linden, I want you to provide the committee the paper 
that says debt levels do not affect long-term interest rates, 
because I have the Peterson Foundation article that says just 
the opposite in their study.
    And I am going to submit that to the record.
    [This article can be found at: www.pgpf.org/blog/2022/12/
the-rising-national-debt-drives-up-interest-rates]
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. I think it is only fair to let 
you submit your article or your dataset that contradicts the 
Peterson Foundation's.
    Mr. Linden. Yeah, I appreciate that, Vice Chairman.
    And just to be very clear, my point is simply that if you 
look at the observed relationship, if you look at a graph of 
interest rates paid on 10-year treasuries----
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. Because you have to look at 
liquidity provided by the Fed and then the rolling up the 
balance sheet. So from a monetarist standpoint, you got some 
real noise in the data.
    Mr. Linden. The data is noisy. But if you look for the past 
40 years, if you had told anybody in 1985, when the interest 
rates were, what, four times what they are today, that the debt 
was going go from 30 percent of GDP to 90 percent of GDP----
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. No, no, I----
    Mr. Linden. Would interest rates go up or down?
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. But what I am just simply asking 
for is provide me the paper. I would love to read it.
    For anyone on the panel, is it rational--how many other 
countries, particularly in the industrialized world, OECD, do 
not actually give a score for internal borrowing?
    If someone were to grab their phone right now and look up 
OECD's calculation for U.S. debt to GDP, they have us at 144 
percent. Do we intend not to pay back the money? Of course we 
intend to pay back the money.
    But we have actually had a couple months, I believe, where 
we actually borrowed money to be able to make the payments on 
our borrowed money.
    And the fact of the matter is we pay interest to the funds, 
as is only appropriate, but it--I just--and this is--this goes 
back actually to my finance classes back in the Dark Ages. We 
had this debate. Is it appropriate how the United States says, 
oh, it is only publicly held, yet you have several trillion 
over here that you are paying interest on, that you do owe, and 
you at this current rate are going to have to either tax or 
borrow to actually pay back those trust funds?
    I mean, give me an opinion. Do we play actually a shell 
game with ourselves?
    Dr. Faulkender. It, to me, depends on the question that you 
are asking. So if you are asking where market interest rates 
are going to find their equilibrium, then it is publicly held 
debt that is relevant.
    But if you want to understand what are the long-term 
obligations, as again somebody who oversaw the Trustees process 
for Social Security and Medicare, we very much want to make 
sure that the revenue stream that comes from the trust fund's 
assets are incorporated into the expectations of being able to 
finance Social Security and Medicare.
    So depending on the question you are asking, it is going to 
vary which measure of that you look at.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. Okay. So it's [crosstalk] 
liability.
    And, Mr. Linden, you sort of----
    Mr. Linden. This is a really great point.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. Almost touched on this----
    Mr. Linden. Yeah.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. When you were talking----
    Mr. Linden. To be very, very clear, so we are all clear, 
CBO's long-term projections essentially do that. They assume 
that all obligations in Social Security and Medicare will be 
fully paid regardless of the status of the trust fund.
    The publicly held debt projections in CBO's projections are 
an accurate reflection of our obligations, and that is why 
publicly held debt is the right way to think about it.
    It is not that the gross--the intergovernmental debt is not 
real. It absolutely is. I completely agree with you. Those are 
real obligations that the government will have to pay. But it 
is fully captured in the CBO projections of publicly held debt.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. Yeah, but in realizing that every 
month we have been functionally, it is an effect of our current 
borrow, because we--I don't think we have, other than 
employee--government employees--really any major trust funds 
that are actually growing. All of them are bleeding. And so now 
each are a negative draw.
    And I don't think there is a complete understanding here 
that we are going to bleed out the Social Security trust fund 
over the next 8, 9 years.
    Mr. Linden. So one way to think about this, Vice Chairman, 
is if you snapped your fingers today and said instead of 
financing Social Security through a trust fund we were just 
going to finance everything through the general fund--I am not 
saying we should do that or shouldn't do that but just as an 
exercise to think about this--you said no more trust fund, we 
are going to get rid of the intergovernmental debt, but we are 
not going change a single benefit, and we are not going change 
a single tax policy, would that change the projections, the 
budget projections at all?
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. No, no, it won't, it would stay 
exactly the same.
    Mr. Linden. It is exactly the same.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. But it stays exactly the same 
because those trust funds are basically gone.
    Mr. Linden. Right, because we already assumed that we 
will--those projections assume that we will pay those 
obligations.
    So that is why it is very important to--I don't focus on 
the intergovernmental debt for economic reasons because the 
obligations are fully captured in the debt projections.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. Okay.
    Mr. Beyer.
    Representative Beyer. When you are done.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. No, no, no, do this. I actually 
like the conversation model. It drives the poor witnesses 
insane, but it makes me happy.
    Representative Beyer. Well, as long as I--I just want to--I 
read a number of interesting articles over the weekend about 
how we have gone from a global savings glut to a global savings 
drought, that it is drying up almost everywhere.
    I would be really interested--I don't know who to ask the 
question to--but what you think that is going end up doing to 
interest rates.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. That is actually a really good 
question.
    Dr. Faulkender. So there has been an interesting hypothesis 
that one of the things the pandemic did is it changed people's 
willingness to delay consumption.
    So if you think about the savings rate--sorry to get really 
finance professor nerdy on you--savings is essentially the 
compensation for deferring consumption. And so to the extent 
that people equate consuming now versus consuming later, that 
is going to drive your interest rate and equilibrium.
    Now, if what the pandemic did is it made people think more 
about today because tomorrow may not be here, not so much 
because of death but because you may all of a sudden be locked 
down for 2 years, we are seeing this much greater desire to--
there seems to be less sensitivity to things like spending on 
vacations. People are willing to do it because you never know 
when you are going to get locked down.
    That means that there is going to be a savings reduction or 
you are going to have a higher interest rate in order to induce 
the same amount of savings to finance the outstanding debt.
    And so that is the hypothesized relationship as to why it 
may--we may see that this reduction in savings, to the extent 
that it is explained by this change in behavior, could lead to 
a higher equilibrium interest rate in order to compensate 
people for the savings that necessarily funds debt.
    Did that make sense?
    Representative Beyer. Yeah, and not limited to the United 
States.
    Dr. Faulkender. Not at all. That change in preferences is 
probably global because the whole world experienced that kind 
of outcome, but it is more acute in the United States because 
we already had low savings rates to begin with.
    Mrs. Boccia. I would add a further point, and that is that, 
as the Vice Chair mentioned earlier, this is also a demographic 
reality, because one thing that also happened during the 
pandemic is that more older individuals that could still work 
decided to retire early. And so you have a large population 
moving into the consumption phase of their life, of their later 
years, rather than continuing to produce, invest, and save.
    So we must not lose sight of the fact that this is also--
the pandemic pulled forward the effects of the aging society on 
our macro economy and this is reflected in lower savings.
    And what that will result in is that there will be less 
capital available for investment. So we should be extra careful 
when we think about raising taxes on capital that will affect 
investment because we no longer have the benefit of the savings 
glut we had previously which offset some of the pressures from 
higher government borrowing on interest rates.
    We benefited from this for a very long time, but that 
period is likely over now.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. All right. My last comments. And 
I really appreciate you being here. I appreciate members that 
have shown up.
    I am disappointed in all of us because we did what we 
normally do. ``You guys cut taxes.'' ``You guys spent too much 
money.''
    And one of the these days there will be a discussion like 
this where we are not going to mention what happened yesterday. 
We are going to talk about tomorrow and the day after that and 
the day after that, where we are demographically, where we are 
technology adoption, where we are in potential immigration 
models.
    And that is actually why I--one of the things I truly 
appreciate you, you are one of my few voices out there that has 
been saying the debt and deficit commission is an opportunity 
for us to at least have some commonality where we so bathed in 
our partisan rage often--look, let's be honest.
    There was a number of things said that--some of you have 
Ph.D.s--that I am here looking at the math facts and I have 
another Ph.D. saying just the opposite.
    I don't know how we deal with the reality. We have an 
issue. Our burn rate, our borrowing rate, and even the 
President's budget yesterday--think about what was in the 
President's budget yesterday.
    Last July, the borrow--the debt was going to be, what, 1.4, 
1.5, maybe 1.6? And yesterday they admitted it is going to now 
be 2.1. But if you actually do the tracking on the daily debt 
right off the Treasury, it is 2.8.
    How in several months you have that types of variance, when 
variance--when CBO, our brothers and sisters across the street, 
come in and they miss the number by a trillion dollars. Is that 
because of something in the tax policy? Is it something 
demographically? Is it parts of the Inflation Reduction Act? 
There is something going on.
    And it is my fixation, is how do we ever sit with Democrats 
and Republicans, like cats and dogs cuddling, and have a common 
understanding of saying here is where we are demographically, 
here is where we are health-wise, and start part of the 
intellectual part of the argument?
    One of the things I am so proud, at least the Joint 
Economic Republicans, what was it, last May, they were willing 
to write a chapter on obesity. And I thought, being the person 
that authorized it and asked them to spend months looking at 
the numbers, I thought I was going to get my head kicked in for 
talking about something we are not allowed to talk about.
    And it turns out I had Democrats saying that is neat, 
because it was, what, 5-some trillion dollars. And we didn't 
even really have the ability to ultimately work out all the 
secondary and third-degree effects of society, family 
formation, other things.
    There are some things here that would be moral, some 
fascinating data of just health being the most powerful--we 
always thought it was education. Maybe health is the most 
powerful thing in income inequality for urban, my Tribal, rural 
poor.
    How many of us have ever sat at a hearing and had anyone 
actually go off-script and say we often are fighting over the 
wrong stuff?
    So, look, my respect, because of my friendship with Mr. 
Beyer, you had one more thing you wanted to share. And then I 
will do the script and I will ask everyone to give us our 
documents over the next couple weeks and then we will go home.
    Representative Beyer. Well, I think, Mr. Chairman, as long 
as you are nerding out, that I would jump in.
    First of all, I think it is discouraging on the fiscal 
commission right now that, at least according to the political 
rags, it is Grover Norquist and Newt Gingrich that are opposing 
it.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. It breaks my heart.
    Representative Beyer. Yeah, which is really--I still think 
one of the biggest mistakes we made was not adopting Simpson-
Bowles. I mean, here we are all these years later buried in it.
    But looking forward, not looking back at TCJA or Simpson-
Bowles or anything else, one of the things in the President's 
budget was getting rid of the step-up in basis. And, obviously, 
there is one reason for doing that, which is it would generate 
a lot more money. The second reason is it is a huge part of why 
our wealth inequality is the largest it has been in a hundred 
years.
    But I would be fascinated from the economist perspective 
about one of the things that we know that it does is it locks 
up an awful lot of assets. We can't sell that real estate 
because we are going to pass it on to our children. And the 
basis was a million, and it is going to be $10 million. And we 
pass it on to the children. That is $9 million that never gets 
taxed, ever, ever, ever.
    It would be interesting to know what you think the debt 
churn rate in the economy and how much new--not just taxes--but 
how much new economic activity would be created by getting rid 
of the step-up in basis.
    Dr. Clausing. I think that would be a very important 
reform, both for fairness reasons, because if you think about 
all these people getting locked into their assets and then 
passing on intergenerational wealth when they could have used 
that money to reinvest in the economy, I think there are 
enormous benefits there.
    And I do agree that we should have more bipartisan 
conversations. And I appreciate Vice Chairman Schweikert's plea 
for that.
    I think JCT and the CBO are national treasures that try to 
bring nonpartisan analysis to things. And, of course, they get 
some scores wrong at times and, of course, forecasting is 
difficult, and they should ceaselessly try to do that better.
    But I do think it behooves us to at least have some factual 
organizations that we are all looking at and we are, like, 
okay, this is what the nonpartisan group is saying about the 
truth of what revenue came in. And there we will be 
fluctuations. But, I think that is--it is a very important 
thing to build on.
    Representative Beyer. We also think that the Joint Economic 
Committee is a national treasure.
    Dr. Clausing. Yes.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. And, look, one of the reasons 
that I am doing this is because we almost never have this 
discussion. And I would prefer us doing roundtables over 
sitting, with the barriers here.
    To Mr. Beyer's step-up in basis, I have an economic paper 
somewhere in one of my binders--I have a bad habit of being a 
pack rat--that was talking about one of the reasons you might 
have less churn in the economy, even though basis has the 
adjustments and the 1031s and some of the other things in 
there, is because so much of your growth in your basis is 
actually inflation.
    So do you sell an asset and pay taxes on something that 
your reinvestment is also now at a new higher basis, because 
how much is true appreciation and how much is just inflation? 
And so you almost need an inflation shock absorber as somewhat 
part of the math so you get that economic velocity.
    I mean, is it wrong to actually think about saying, okay, 
if he wants to affect basis, we should at least have an 
inflation calculator in there?
    Dr. Clausing. Inflation is definitely part of the 
situation.
    But one thing to bear in mind is that investors also 
benefit from deferral. When you earn income year after year, 
somebody takes out the money every single time you earn it. 
Whereas if you have something invested, in that whole time that 
it is growing free of tax it is going to grow to a much larger 
number than it would otherwise. And that deferral advantage is 
much larger than the inflation disadvantage. You are exactly 
right that the inflation----
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. The need to adjust it.
    Being someone who actually managed some resources, what we 
would often do is just borrow off of it.
    Dr. Clausing. Yeah, I mean, you can borrow against it.
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. Dr. Faulkender.
    Dr. Faulkender. Yeah. So to the Congressman's earlier 
question, I have never really particularly understood why we--I 
think the basis step-up existed because if you go back decades, 
it was very difficult for heirs to figure out what was the 
original basis of the asset when my forebears originally 
purchased it.
    If you look at the electronification of financial 
recordkeeping, I think that that is a much less salient 
argument today. And to be honest, I would much rather see the 
sale of the asset be the taxable event than the death of the 
owner be the taxable event.
    And so if you were to ask me, I would prefer a basis step-
up over an estate tax. I think that is a much more economically 
efficient way to go after accumulated capital gains.
    If we are really going after stuff right now, I would also 
say that I don't think that people should be able to borrow--
and I am speaking entirely for myself now.
    I thought that when Elon Musk purchased Twitter, the idea 
that he could borrow against his Twitter stock and not pay 
capital gains taxes on that, rather than liquidate the Twitter 
holdings in order to come up with the money and then I think 
count on a basis step-up at the end of his estate in order to 
essentially permanently avoid that run-up, I think that that is 
a problem in the Tax Code that we should be able to find 
bipartisan consensus on fixing.
    Mr. Linden. Bipartisan consensus, my former colleague at 
OMB, Zach Liscow, has a proposal to tax the borrowing against 
unrealized gains for exactly that reason. So there is 
bipartisan. That would raise a hundred billion dollars over the 
next----
    Vice Chairman Schweikert. Okay. My only point, and then I 
am going to gavel us down so we can go back and do something 
useful.
    For staff who is watching this, think about it. In the last 
6 minutes you had actually more intellectually robust 
conversation than we did in the previous hour. Help us figure 
out a way to do more of this.
    All right. And with that, I would like to thank everyone 
for being here.
    I am going--let's make it 7 days to get the articles in.
    And with that, we are adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 4:14 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]
