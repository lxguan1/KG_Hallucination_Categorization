                         Thursday, May 2, 2024

                                       U.S. Senate,
       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:01 a.m., in 
room 430, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Bernard Sanders, 
Chairman of the Committee, presiding.

    Present: Senators Sanders [presiding], Casey, Baldwin, 
Kaine, Hassan, Smith, Hickenlooper, Cassidy, Braun, Marshall, 
and Tuberville.

                  OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR SANDERS

    The Chair. All right. The Senate Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions will come to order.

    Today, our Committee is going to focus on two extremely 
important health care issues that must be addressed. First are 
the major need for more Black, Latino, and Native American 
doctors and medical professionals.

    Second, the alarming rate of maternal deaths in America 
that is disproportionately impacting Black, Latino, and Native 
American women.

    In the midst of a health care system that, in my view, is 
largely broken and dysfunctional, where we spend almost twice 
as much per capita on health care as the people of any other 
country, or 85 million Americans today are uninsured or 
underinsured, and where we don't have enough doctors, nurses, 
dentists, mental health specialists, or pharmacists, we have 
another crisis on top of all of that, and that is that problem 
of lack of medical personnel is extremely, especially acute in 
Black, Latino, and Native American communities, which is the 
subject of our hearing today.

    Despite making up almost 14 percent of our population, just 
5 percent of all doctors in our Country are Black, less than 4 
percent of all dentists, and just 6 percent of all nurses in 
America are African American.

    Further, despite making up over 19 percent of our 
population, just 6 percent of doctors and dentists and just 7 
percent of nurses in America are Latino. And, we cannot forget 
the Native American community, which makes up 1.3 percent of 
our population, but just three-tenths of 1 percent of all 
doctors in our Country are Native American. So why is this an 
important issue that we have got to address?

    Well, the answer is that study after study has shown that 
when Black, Latino, and Native American patients have access to 
Black, Latino, and Native American doctors, their health 
outcomes substantially improve. They are more likely to receive 
preventative services. They are more satisfied with their care.

    They are more likely to live longer and happier lives. In 
my view, it is unacceptable that life expectancy on average, 
which is low in America in general, is about 5 years lower for 
Black Americans and 11 years lower for Native Americans than it 
is for White Americans.

    It is unacceptable that Black Americans are more likely to 
die of heart disease and have the highest rates of cancer of 
any other group in America. It is not acceptable that Black 
Americans are more than twice as likely to have diabetes, an 
issue that we are dealing with right now.

    A major epidemic in America, twice as high in the Black 
communities than in the white community. And one of the most 
alarming and troubling health disparities in America is the 
maternal mortality rate, which is the other major focus that we 
will be talking about today.

    In America today, we have the highest maternal mortality 
rate and the highest infant mortality rate of any other wealthy 
country on Earth. In fact, the maternal mortality rate in 
America is 19 times higher than Norway, 4 times higher than 
France.

    Incredibly, according to the CDC, women in America today 
are twice as likely to die from childbirth as their--than their 
mothers. And as bad as this crisis is overall, it is much, much 
worse for Black women and infants.

    In America today, Black women are nearly three times more 
likely to die from pregnancy related complications than their 
white counterparts. The crisis is also getting significantly 
worse for Latina women. Between 2019 and 2020, the Latina 
maternal mortality rate skyrocketed by 44 percent in just 1 
year.

    Meanwhile, Black infants in America are almost four times 
more likely to die from complications due to low birth weight 
than white infants. So, the question then becomes, given that 
reality, what are we going to do about it? How are we going to 
address what is obviously a major health care crisis in 
America?

    That is what we will be discussing this morning. Just a few 
things that I think we have got to do. We need to substantially 
increase the class sizes of historically Black colleges and 
universities, and we will be hearing from representatives of 
one of them today. We need to pass the Black Maternal Health 
Momnibus Act, introduced by Senator Booker and Senator Butler.

    Senator Butler will be talking about that today. We need to 
substantially increase funding for the women, infants, and 
children program. We need to substantially increase funding for 
the National Health Service Corps.

    In my view, we need to cancel student debt and make all 
public colleges and universities tuition free so that all 
people, regardless of background and income, will be able to 
get the education they need, including going to medical school.

    In fact, the good news is that making tuition, medical 
school tuition free, is a growing idea. In fact, four medical 
schools in America, including the New York University School of 
Medicine, are currently tuition free, while five others have 
made tuition temporarily free or offering free tuition to 
working class students.

    We have got a lot to talk about today and I look forward to 
a serious discussion about a serious issue, and I thank our 
panelists who are here with us.

    Senator Cassidy.

                  OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CASSIDY

    Senator Cassidy. Thank you, Chair Sanders. This Committee 
has covered the shortages of physicians and other health 
workers extensively. Shortages hurt the delivery of health care 
in all communities.

    My home State of Louisiana, projected to have the third 
worst shortage of physicians of any state by 2030. We need more 
doctors, particularly in the underserved areas lacking 
sufficient health care resources. My practice as a physician 
was for 25 years in a hospital serving the uninsured and the 
poorly insured, which is to say Medicaid.

    This is something which I have spent my professional life 
attempting to address. Today, we are going to look specifically 
at minority doctors and health professionals underrepresented 
in our health care system.

    For example, African American physicians account for only 8 
percent of all physicians, despite comprising 13.6 percent of 
the population. Now, if you are listening carefully, you will 
note that my statistics are different than the Chairs'.

    His is 5 percent and mine is 8 percent. My data is more--he 
uses the Association of American Medical Colleges 2019 data, 
and I am using the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is 2022 
data. That is important. 2019, 2022 Government data. A little 
bit more up to date, a little bit more valid.

    Maybe there is progress being made. And as we look at 
something which needs to be addressed, we can also say that if 
we have gone from 5 to 8 percent, there may be progress being 
made, and that is a good thing.

    But it is interesting to note that this disparity is not 
felt across all minorities. Asian doctors account for 22 
percent of all physicians but are only 6.8 percent of the 
population. And this is an important nuance as we address this 
situation. It is also important to note, as the Chair notes, 
that we have a limited number of GME residency slots to train 
new doctors.

    These residency positions are not allocated or dispersed to 
reflect where underserved communities are. Unfortunately, this 
topic is under Finance jurisdiction, but it is an important 
context and needs to be considered in any conversation about 
addressing health care workforce shortage.

    It is kind of a truism that a physician will practice 
within 100 miles of whether--where she or he does their 
residency. If the residency spot is not in an underserved area, 
it is not going to be within that 100 miles.

    But access to opportunity is crucial. I want to highlight 
and brag on Xavier University, a Historically Black College and 
University in my State of Louisiana. This week, they announced 
an agreement with Ochsner Health to open a medical school in 
New Orleans at Xavier.

    Many of the doctors trained at Xavier, which has had a 
traditional mission to serve the underserved and to provide 
opportunity for minorities, they will stay in Louisiana and go 
elsewhere to serve those populations.

    I am proud of Xavier, and I look forward to continuing to 
support their effort. Now, as a doctor, I am so aware and 
desire to support those nurses who have climbed the career 
ladder by building credentials over time through upskilling.

    Despite from benefiting the individual, it benefits the 
capabilities of our workforce. It also benefits their family as 
their child sees the impact of their mother or father seeking 
through education and delayed gratification, greater 
opportunity that results in more prosperity.

    There is a woman I worked with named Olive, who went from a 
nurse's assistant to an LPN to an RN to a nurse manager, and 
the clinic in which she formerly was the NA, she ultimately 
ended up being the manager of. Incredible story. We will have 
someone here today with a similar story.

    Dr. Jaines Andrades will tell us how she has done that in 
her career, and that is something that we need to think how to 
enable. We should also look at other challenges to ensure our 
health care system meets the need of all, especially the 
underserved.

    Making sure that patients from all walks of life can 
participate in clinical trials, which oftentimes gives the most 
advanced--most advanced treatment to those who have the most 
advanced disease.

    As I mentioned from my career, making sure that all have 
high quality medical treatment is something I am passionate 
about. One of our witnesses today, Dr. Brian Stone, will tell 
us how he is trying to address these issues in his community.

    The Committee will also discuss maternal mortality, a topic 
incredibly important that has been a priority of mine in 
Congress, and it is important to acknowledge that this issue 
disproportionately affects African Americans.

    As a doctor, again, who worked in Louisiana's charity 
hospital system, I know this community from my practice, and I 
know that this community is at high risk. That is why I am 
pleased to have U.S. Representative and Dr. Michael Burgess 
testifying.

    He is an OB-GYN who stayed up many nights delivering 
medical care to pregnant moms and their babies in an 
underserved population of Dallas. Now, as a legislator, Dr. 
Burgess is a leader in addressing racial disparities in health 
care, and it has been an honor to work with him on legislation 
specifically tackling maternal mortality.

    We were unaware that we were having a Members of Congress 
panel until Sunday, so we greatly appreciate him joining us on 
short notice when actually they were adjourned last night. His 
participation helps make clear that Congress understands the 
severity of the issue and is working to address.

    I am also proud to have led several bipartisan legislative 
efforts to improve maternal mortality and reduce health care 
disparities. In 2022, Congress passed the Maternal Health 
Quality Improvement Act, which helps address maternal 
mortality, particularly that disparity within African 
Americans.

    It also supports research examining the best practices to 
reduce and prevent racial discrimination in the American health 
care system. The same year, Congress passed my legislation, the 
John Lewis National Institute in Minority Health and Health 
Disparities Research Endowment Revitalization Act.

    It is a mouthful, but it is a good piece of legislation 
that provided funding to institutions, including Xavier, to 
conduct research and address minority health disparities. And 
last year in this Committee, we passed the Preventing Maternal 
Deaths Reauthorization Act, the legislation led in the House by 
Dr. Burgess, and the bill directs the CDC to provide hospitals 
and other providers information on best practices to prevent 
maternal mortality.

    This reauthorization has not yet become law, but we are 
pushing for passage this Congress. All this work shows a 
bipartisan commitment in Congress to addressing health 
disparities, but there is more to do.

    The connected maternal online monitoring systems or the 
Connected MOM Act, doctor--Senator Butler, I was about to 
demote you or promote you by calling you doctor, which I 
introduced with Senator Hassan of New Hampshire of this 
Committee, promotes Medicaid coverage of remote monitoring 
technologies for those who are pregnant at higher risk of 
complications.

    The need for moms in underserved urban or rural areas who 
travel sometimes hours on public transportation to a doctor's 
office can be a major impediment to care. This legislation 
allows a physician to remotely monitor her health, watching for 
indicators of potential complications.

    It is bipartisan and improves access to crucial health care 
for moms, and it prevents maternal deaths. While this bill is 
in Finance jurisdiction, I look forward to the discussion today 
on how we can continue to make progress on maternal mortality 
in the HELP Committee.

    Thanks to our witnesses for being here and providing your 
expertise on how we better address these important issues. With 
that, I yield.

    The Chair. Thank you, Senator Cassidy. Our first witness 
will be Senator Laphonza Butler, a Senator from California.

    Senator Butler is a long standing advocate for health care 
workforce and increasing opportunities for students from 
underrepresented and disadvantaged backgrounds in the health 
professions.

    She is also a strong advocate for reducing maternal health 
disparities and combating the Black maternal health crisis. 
Senator Butler, thanks for being here.

  STATEMENT OF HON. LAPHONZA BUTLER, UNITED STATES SENATOR, CA

    Senator Butler. Thank you, Chairman Sanders and Ranking 
Member Cassidy for the hearing today. Thank you to other 
Members of the Committee for joining. Your leadership on this 
issue is demonstrable.

    Thanks for having me. It is an honor, truly, to sit before 
today's Committee to bring added amplification to the lack of 
diversity within our Nation's health care system, as you both 
have outlined so clearly, and in addition, the worsening 
maternal health crisis.

    Before I begin my testimony, I would like to acknowledge 
those leaders who have been championing this issue prior to my 
arrival in the U.S. Senate.

    It is leaders like Representative Lauren Underwood, our 
colleague Senator Booker, who introduced the Black Maternal 
Health Momnibus in the Senate, and Representative Alma Adams, 
for their leadership in developing the Black Maternal Health 
Caucus, and the leadership. I also cannot sit here without 
recognizing Vice President Kamala Harris, who introduced the 
first version of the Momnibus while serving in the Senate.

    She continues to lead the Biden-Harris administration's 
efforts to improve maternal health outcomes. These are 
champions that I am proud to stand alongside. I want to also 
take a brief moment to highlight Dr. Michael Galvez, who is a 
witness in today's hearing and is also a resident of California 
and one of my constituents.

    Dr. Galvez is a board certified plastic and reconstructive 
surgeon specializing in pediatric hand surgery in Valley 
Children's Hospital in Madera, California. He co-created 
National Latino Physician Day to bring attention to the fact 
that while Latinos make up 19 percent of the population, they 
account for only 6 to 7 percent of the physician workforce.

    Thank you for being here today, Dr. Galvez. Our health care 
system and the state of maternal health in this country is at 
an inflection point that requires the urgent attention of this 
Committee. The numbers should alarm all of us.

    The United States has the highest rate of maternal 
mortality among high income nations. Within recent years, 
thousands of women have lost their lives due to pregnancy 
related causes. And over the past decade, while the birth rate 
in this country has declined by roughly 20 percent, maternal 
mortality rates have steadily risen.

    The crisis is exacerbated in communities grappling with a 
lack of access to essential maternal health care. According to 
a report produced by the March of Dimes, one-third of counties 
in the United States are considered maternity care deserts, 
meaning there are no hospitals providing obstetric care, no 
birth centers, and no obstetric providers.

    Think about that. Imagine your loved one preparing to give 
birth and bring new life into your family and having no choice 
but to drive hours away from home to seek the care they need. 
We know from the research and the numbers that this crisis has 
not been felt equally.

    Among Black and native indigenous communities, maternal 
mortality rates are two to four times higher compared to those 
of white communities. Two to four times higher are in--Black 
and Native American women are more likely to die in a pregnancy 
related death.

    While Black and Brown communities experience the highest 
rates of maternal mortality and morbidity, these populations 
also remain starkly underrepresented within the health care 
field. While an estimated 13 percent of our Country's 
population identifies as Black, only about 5 percent of 
physicians in the United States are Black.

    Research suggests that under the care of Black physicians, 
the mortality rate for newborns decreases by over 50 percent, 
which is why I applaud and urge this Committee's continued 
efforts to not only bolster the health care workforce, but to 
use every tool to ensure that workforce is diverse and equipped 
to provide unbiased and culturally competent care.

    Only then can we begin to change the course of our Nation's 
current health care system. And we know that this must not mean 
focusing exclusively on physicians. For families, mothers, and 
babies, this means doulas and nurse midwives, nutritionists, 
and the full spectrum of reproductive health care professionals 
that contribute to their health, well-being, and birthing 
experience.

    Having access to a comprehensive care team can make the 
world of difference for families. For example, in my home State 
of California, the Martin Luther King Community Hospital in Los 
Angeles has reimagined the birth experience for women serving--
within its service community.

    When I visited the hospital, I first--I saw firsthand how 
doulas and nurse midwives were integrated into their overall 
maternal health care model to ensure that birthing mothers 
receive the highest quality and most comprehensive care.

    The leadership of Dr. Elaine Batchlor has made an 
indispensable difference. And even as we have existing models 
and we consider other proposed solutions to this crisis, I 
implore this Committee to advance the Black Maternal Health 
Momnibus Act led by Senator Booker.

    The Momnibus is comprised of 13 individual bills that would 
combat the Black maternal health crisis and make historic 
investments to address comprehensively and deliver--every 
driver of maternal mortality, morbidity, and disparities in the 
United States. This legislation is not just about the life and 
death of Black women.

    Its enactment will improve birthing outcomes for all women. 
The Momnibus includes bills such as the Kiera Johnson Act, 
which would make necessary investments in community based 
organizations that are leading the charge to protect mothers 
and support culturally competent training within maternity care 
settings.

    This bill is named after Kiera Johnson, a Black mother who 
in 2016 checked into a hospital with her husband, Charles, to 
give birth to their second child, Langston. Despite being in 
excellent health, Kiera died from a hemorrhage in the hours 
after delivering young Langston. Kiera should be here today.

    The lives of her husband and her sons have forever been 
changed. The Johnson family's tragic experience, and that of so 
many other families, should be a wakeup call for us to act with 
urgency to address the need of unbiased, patient centered care. 
Today's hearing is an important step in the right direction.

    I urge this Committee to hold additional sessions focused 
on the Black maternal health crisis and important legislation 
that my colleagues and other advocates have introduced and 
researched.

    This Committee, which holds the primary jurisdiction for 
the Black maternal health Momnibus, and so many other maternal 
health policy solutions is having a--hasn't had a recent 
hearing on the topic.

    Last month, during Black Maternal Health Week, I convened a 
roundtable of prominent maternal health leaders and experts for 
discussion on how we can work together to combat the maternal 
health crisis.

    We discussed the hurdles that lie ahead in advancing the 
Momnibus and similar legislation. Those advocates shared with 
me that they believed that they would have to remove the word 
Black from the title of the Momnibus. They believe that only 
then the legislation would be likely to gain the necessary 
support for passage.

    After spending some time with my colleagues in the Senate, 
spending time with many of you, I don't believe that to be 
true. I know this Committee is filled with Senators, public 
servants, who represent Black women living in each of their 
states.

    I am here to stand with you and to show every American 
watching that I stand with leaders on this Committee who 
together demonstrate our commitment to the Black and Brown 
women and their families who suffer the most in our health care 
system.

    We have solutions at the ready, and I know that anti-Black 
sentiment will not serve as a barrier toward progress. While I 
serve in this chamber, I will continue to stand with all of you 
loudly and proudly, ensuring that we deliver the investments 
required to meet this moment for caregivers, health care 
personnel, the mothers and families in California, and 
throughout the Nation.

    I look forward to working with this Committee and my 
colleagues in both chambers as we advance comprehensive 
solutions and utilize every level to prevent maternal deaths in 
this country. Thank you.

    [The prepared statement of Senator Butler follows.]
             prepared statement of senator laphonza butler
    Thank you, Chairman Sanders and Ranking Member Cassidy, for 
inviting me to today's important hearing. It is an honor to sit before 
the Committee today, to bring critical attention to the lack of 
diversity within our Nation's health care system, and the worsening 
maternal health crisis.

    Before I begin my testimony--I'd like to submit a statement for the 
record on behalf of Representative Lauren Underwood who has long worked 
to champion these issues. I would also like to thank Senator Booker and 
Representative Alma Adams for their leadership in elevating the 
devastating Black maternal health crisis.

    As leaders of the Black Maternal Health Caucus and the Black 
Maternal Health Momnibus Act--they have made it their mission to 
thoughtfully address maternal health disparities. I also want to 
recognize Vice President Kamala Harris, who introduced the first 
version of the Momnibus, while serving in the Senate. She continues to 
lead the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to improve maternal 
health outcomes.

    Thank you to all of these champions for your unwavering commitment. 
I am proud to stand alongside each of you in this effort.

    I also want to take a moment to highlight Dr. Michael Galvez, who 
is a witness in today's hearing and is also one of my constituents. Dr. 
Galvez is a Board-certified plastic and reconstructive surgeon 
specializing in Pediatric Hand Surgery in Valley Children's Hospital in 
Madera, California. He co-created National Latino Physician Day to 
bring attention to the fact that while Latinos make up 19 percent of 
the population, they account for only 6-7 percent of the physician 
workforce. Thank you for being here today, Dr. Galvez.

    Our health care system and the state of maternal health in this 
country is at an inflection point that requires the urgent attention of 
this Committee. The numbers should alarm us all: The United States has 
the highest rate of maternal mortality among high-income nations. 
Within recent years, thousands of women have lost their lives due to 
pregnancy-related causes. And over the past decade, while the birth 
rate in this country has declined by roughly 20 percent, maternal 
mortality rates have steadily risen.

    This crisis is exacerbated in communities grappling with a lack of 
access to essential maternal health care. According to a report 
produced by the March of Dimes, one-third of counties in the United 
States are considered maternity care deserts, meaning there are no 
hospitals providing obstetric care, no birth centers, and no obstetric 
providers. Think about that--imagine your loved one preparing to give 
birth and bring new life into your family, and having no choice but to 
drive hours away from home to seek care.

    We know from the numbers that this crisis that has not been felt 
equally. Among Black and Native Indigenous communities, maternal 
mortality rates are two to four times higher compared to those of White 
communities. Let me repeat that--Black and Native American women are 
two to four times more likely to die a pregnancy-related death.

    While Black and Brown communities experience the highest rates of 
maternal mortality and morbidity, these populations also remain starkly 
underrepresented within the health care field. While an estimated 13 
percent of our Country's population identifies as Black, only about 6 
percent of physicians in the United States are Black.

    Research suggests that under the care of Black physicians, the 
mortality rate for newborns decreases by over 50 percent, which is why 
I applaud and urge the Committee's continued efforts to not only 
bolster the health care workforce, but to use every tool to ensure this 
workforce is diverse and equipped to provide unbiased, culturally 
competent care. Only then can we begin to change the course of our 
Nation's current health care system.

    This must not mean focusing exclusively on physicians. For 
families, mothers, and babies, this means doulas, nurse midwives, 
nutritionists, and the full spectrum of reproductive health care 
professionals that contribute to their health, well-being, and birthing 
experience. Having access to a comprehensive care team can make a world 
of a difference for families. For example, in my home state of 
California, the Martin Luther King Community Hospital in Los Angeles 
has reimagined the birthing experience for women within its service 
community. When I visited the hospital, I saw firsthand how doulas and 
nurse midwives are integrated into their overall maternal health care 
model to ensure that birthing mothers receive the highest quality, most 
comprehensive care. The leadership of Dr. Elaine Batchlor has made an 
indispensable difference.

    Even as we have existing models and as we consider other proposed 
solutions to these crises, I implore this Committee to advance the 
Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act led by Sen. Booker. The Momnibus is 
comprised of 13 individual bills that would combat the Black Maternal 
Health crisis and make historic investments to comprehensively address 
every driver of maternal mortality, morbidity, and disparities in the 
United States. This legislation is not just about the life and death of 
Black women--it's enactment will improve birthing outcomes for all 
women.

    The Momnibus includes bills such as the Kira Johnson Act, which 
would make necessary investments in community-based organizations that 
are leading the charge to protect mothers--and support culturally 
competent training within maternity care settings. The bill is named 
after Kira Johnson--a Black mother who, in 2016, checked into a 
hospital with her husband Charles to give birth to their second child, 
Langston. Despite being in excellent health, Kira died from a 
hemorrhage in the hours after delivering Langston. Kira should still be 
here today. The lives of her husband and sons have been forever 
changed. The Johnson family's tragic experience, and that of so many 
other families, should be a wake up call for us to act with urgency to 
address the need for unbiased patient-centered care.

    Today's hearing is an important step in the right direction. I urge 
this Committee to hold additional sessions--focused on the Black 
maternal health crisis and the important legislation that my colleagues 
and other advocates have introduced and researched. This Committee, 
which holds primary jurisdiction of the Black Maternal Health Momnibus 
and so many maternal health policy solutions, has not held a recent

discussion on how we can work together to combat the Black Maternal 
Health crisis. We discussed the hurdles that lie ahead in advancing the 
Momnibus and similar legislation.

    Those advocates shared with me that they believed that they would 
have to remove the word ``Black'' from the title of the Momnibus. They 
believe that only then would the legislation be more likely to gain the 
necessary support and passage. After spending time with my colleagues 
in the Senate, spending time with many of you, I don't believe that to 
be true. I know this Committee is filled with Senators, public 
servants, who represent Black women living in each of their states. I 
know that this body is resolved to ensure that the Black women they 
serve can count on you to hear their experiences and take action to 
save their lives. I am here to show every American watching that I 
stand with the leaders on this Committee as we, together, demonstrate 
our commitment to the Black and Brown women and their families who 
suffer the most in our health care system.

    We have solutions at the ready--and I know that anti-Black 
sentiment will not continue to serve as a barrier toward progress. 
While I serve in this chamber, I will continue to stand with all of 
you--loudly and proudly--ensuring we deliver the investments required 
to meet this moment for caregivers, health care personnel, and the 
mothers and families in California and throughout the Nation. I look 
forward to working with the Committee, and my colleagues in both 
chambers to advance comprehensive solutions and utilize every lever to 
prevent maternal deaths in this country.

    Thank You.

    The Chair. Well, thank you very much, Senator Butler. Our 
next witness will be Congressman Michael Burgess, 
representative from Texas. I think Senator Cassidy, you wanted 
to introduce the Congressman.

    Senator Cassidy. Yes. It is a pleasure to introduce a 
witness and a friend, the honorable Michael Burgess, an OB-GYN, 
representative for 20 years, the 26th District of Texas in the 
House of Representatives.

    He is the Chair of the Budget Committee, the health care 
task force. Chair of the Rules Committee. He serves on Energy 
and Commerce. He has used his wealth of knowledge in maternal 
health and in building the health care workforce to advance key 
pieces of legislation addressing these issues.

    He has, as you might guess, a unique perspective as both a 
policymaker and as a practitioner. So, Dr. Burgess, thanks for 
being here.

   STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS, M.D., UNITED STATES 
      CONGRESSMAN, TWENTY SIXTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, TX

    Dr. Burgess. Thank you, Dr. Cassidy. Chairman Sanders, 
Members of the Committee, thank you for allowing me the 
opportunity of testifying here this morning. I do represent the 
26th District in the State of Texas.

    In the House, we have congressional districts. So that is 
the area near the Dallas-Fort Worth airport--just to locate it 
for you. Before coming to Congress, I spent nearly three 
decades practicing medicine in that area.

    Look, I know practicing medicine can be very complex. I 
chose obstetrics because if there is attention to detail, the 
results can almost always be satisfactory. I spent time in 
residency as an OB-GYN at Parkland Hospital.

    Statistically, Parkland has some of the best outcomes in 
the country due to its emphasis on proper care and attention to 
detail. When I started my residency, I remember Dr. Jack 
Pritchard, who was the leader of the Department of Obstetrics 
and Gynecology at the time, pointing out that in practicing OB, 
you are unique in medicine.

    Those privileged enough to continue were going to be 
charged with taking care of the simultaneous care of two 
patients with a combined life expectancy of 100 years. Nowhere 
else in medicine does that occur.

    The patient population for Parkland, the Dallas County 
Hospital District, serves both rural and urban communities in 
and around Dallas. In my time, the clientele was multi-ethnic, 
almost completely uninsured or underinsured, but again, they 
have some of the best statistics in the country.

    The lesson for me there always was, it doesn't have to be 
this way. You can do better. And I would like for us to focus 
on that with whatever our public policies are going forward. 
For myself, I have delivered in private practice over 3,000 
babies, treated patients who have suffered from miscarriages, 
ectopic pregnancy, stillbirths, sickle cell, and other life 
threatening conditions.

    Whether my responsibility was to step in and deliver a baby 
or save a life, I did it without hesitation. For this reason, I 
have spent my career trying to increase access to quality 
health care for patients through both my experience as a 
physician and a legislator.

    In 2005, through what I described as the miracle of 
redistricting, I picked up an area the East side of the city of 
Fort Worth. It had one of the highest infant mortality rates in 
the country.

    Despite the challenges, it took years of concerted effort, 
but eventually I was successful in getting a federally 
qualified health center with a pediatric unit in that part of 
Fort Worth. A collaboration with a Democratic County 
Commissioner, Roy Brooks, the Mayor of Fort Worth, Mike 
Moncrief, who was a prior Democratic State Senator.

    It was through that joint effort and the experience and the 
expertise and the passion that led us to championing those 
issues. Now in Congress, I have continued that, as well as 
other health care issues that are improving the health of the 
Nation.

    The alarming trend of our Country's rate of maternal 
mortality first came to my attention in September 2018, and my 
copy of the Green Journal, the Journal of Obstetrics and 
Gynecology.

    The original research cited in the journal stated that the 
maternal mortality rates increased in Texas between 2011 and 
2012. But then a new study found that the number of maternal 
deaths in Texas in 2012 was actually half than the number 
previously reported. In other words, there was a mistake in the 
arithmetic.

    Because of that, the focus became on how things were 
counted rather than how do we prevent these bad things from 
happening. The study was retracted, but again the discussion 
became about the numbers, not about the patients, and that was 
unfortunate.

    I personally believe one maternal death is too many, and it 
is important that we capture these deaths accurately to 
understand the scope of maternal mortality in the United States 
and my State of Texas, and that we have a better understanding 
of how to address them.

    In combination, we cannot legislate good practice, but we 
can provide the tools to be able to come up with the best 
practices and increase access to maternity care. These critical 
points have influenced my policy work.

    Here are some actual tangible results from that. Because of 
the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act, which was signed into law 
in 2018, and increasing the dollars spent on maternal mortality 
review committees, it actually came to my attention that 53 
percent of maternal deaths were occurring 1 week to 1 year 
after delivery.

    I had been focusing on that time actually in hospital, but 
by broadening the lens out a little bit, more lives can be 
saved. And as a consequence, now there was an amendment to a 
state plan amendment available to Medicare--I am sorry, the 
Medicaid and CHIP programs that has allowed inclusion of 
postpartum care up to a full year after delivery.

    Texas, I am happy to say, enacted that on March 1st of this 
year, and now new moms in Texas are going to have the benefit 
of an additional year of postpartum coverage. 3338, which was 
referenced in Senator Cassidy's opening remarks, has passed the 
House, and I encourage you to look at that in the Senate.

    I think we can do more with what we--our approach that the 
disciplinary maternal mortality review committees and the 
causes of maternal deaths. I cannot stress enough the 
importance of continuing bipartisan work to reduce disparities, 
improve outcomes.

    We can bolster our public health workforce. We can actually 
start by paying our doctors, so they don't retire early, or 
never enter the practice of medicine in the first place. That 
has been a particular concern of mine since coming to Congress.

    Repeal of the Sustainable Growth Rate formula and the 
approach to value based care that followed in its place. 
Although it is imperfect and we still got a ways to go, these 
are important parameters that will benefit all Americans.

    I have had the good fortune of working with your future 
colleague, Lisa Blunt Rochester, soon to be Senator from 
Delaware, in my understanding. I also work with Robin Kelly and 
Danny Davis, working with Danny Davis to improve the care of 
the sickle cell patient, which importantly really had not 
received any new FDA approved therapies in over 40 years until 
we began to work on that in--right after the Cures Act passed.

    I know my time is done, but I just want to stress that 
there are important things we can work on together, House and 
Senate, Republican and Democrat, and it is our obligation to 
those future Americans that we do so.

    This generation of doctors is coming up, is going to have 
tools to alleviate human suffering that no generation of 
doctors has ever known. It is our job to deliver that to them 
in a timely fashion. Thank you for your attention this morning. 
I yield back.

    [The prepared statement of Dr. Burgess follows.]
               prepared statement of hon. michael burgess
    Chair Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and Members of the Senate 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to speak at today's hearing.

    I am Representative Michael C. Burgess from Texas' 26th District. 
Before coming to Congress, I dedicated nearly three decades to 
practicing medicine in Texas. Between myself, my grandfather, and my 
father combined we have practiced medicine for nearly the whole of the 
twentieth century. Practicing medicine can be very complex. However, I 
chose obstetrics since there is almost always a satisfactory result. I 
spent time in residency as an OB-GYN at Parkland Memorial Hospital in 
Dallas, Texas. Statistically, Parkland had some of the best outcomes in 
the country due to its emphasis on proper care and attention of 
patients. At the time, I remember the Chairman of the Department of 
Obstetrics and Gynecology pointed out that the practice of obstetrics 
is unique in medicine, and those privileged enough to continue were 
going to be charged with taking care of two patients with a combined 
life expectancy of 100 years. Nowhere else in medicine does one have 
the ability to do that.

    The patient population near Parkland often came from both rural and 
urban communities in Dallas. In my time, the clientele was multi-
ethnic, largely uninsured, or underinsured. Throughout my career, I 
have delivered over 3,000 babies and treated patients who had suffered 
from miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, stillbirths, sickle cell, and 
other life-threatening conditions. Whether my responsibility was to 
step in and deliver a baby, or save a life, it was done without 
hesitation. For this reason, I've spent my career trying to increase 
access to quality health care for patients, both through my experience 
as a physician and as a legislator.

    In 2005, I became aware of the rising infant mortality rates in 
Southeast Fort Worth. Despite the challenges, it took several years of 
concerted effort, but eventually, I successfully established a 
federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) with a maternal unit. 
Remarkably, the center was opened through a longstanding collaboration 
with the Democratic County Commissioner and Mayor of Fort Worth. It was 
my experience, expertise, and passion in maternal health care that led 
me to championing this issue in Congress as well as other health issues 
aimed at improving health disparities.

    The alarming trend in our Country's rate of maternal mortality 
first came to my attention in September 2018, when I was reading my 
copy of the Green Journal. The original research cited in the journal 
stated that maternal mortality rates increased in Texas between 2011 
and 2012. \1\ The new study found that the number of maternal deaths in 
Texas in 2012 was less than half the number previously reported.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5001799/.

    The peer-reviewed research, published in the journal Obstetrics and 
Gynecology, determined there were 56 maternal deaths among Texas 
residents compared with 147 reported in national statistics. \2\ Later 
on, it was released that the state overcounted the deaths due to a new 
method of how Texas was reporting data that was different than other 
states. This retraction of the study made disputes over the statistics 
the subject of national news coverage as opposed to the lives that need 
saving.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\  https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/abstract/2018/05000/
identifying-maternal-deaths-in-texas-using-an.3.aspx.

    I believe that any maternal death is one too many. It is important 
that we capture these deaths accurately to understand the scope of 
maternal mortality in the United States and have a better understanding 
of how to address them. In combination, we cannot legislate good 
practice, but we can provide the tools to be able to come up with best 
practices and increase access to maternity care. These critical points 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
have influenced my policy work during my time as a legislator.

    Throughout the years, I have worked across the aisle on several 
pieces of legislation that became law, including H.R. 315 The Improving 
Access to Maternity Care Act and H.R. 4387 The Maternal Health Quality 
Improvement Act. Additionally, I am currently a lead sponsor of H.R. 
3838 The Preventing Maternal Deaths Reauthorization Act, H.R. 7432 The 
Sickle Disease Comprehensive Care Act, and H.R. 3226 The PREEMIE 
Reauthorization Act of 2023. In the past, I have led critical 
reauthorizations of Title VII Health Professional Education and 
Training Programs to increase access to health care in underserved 
areas and diversify the health care workforce. I also worked on H.R. 
5395 The Expanding Connectivity for Health Outcomes Act (ECHO) Act, 
which promoted connection between primary care providers and 
specialists, increasing access to specialty care for underserved 
communities.

    Part of the goal of H.R. 3838 was to establish Maternal Mortality 
Review Committees (MMRCs). These multidisciplinary committees review 
the causes of maternal deaths in their state or other localities and 
make recommendations based on their findings to prevent future deaths 
and improve maternal health outcomes during pregnancy, childbirth, and 
the postpartum period. Through my work on this legislation, Maternal 
Mortality Review Committees were able to discover that 53 percent of 
pregnancy-related deaths happen between 7 days and 1-year post-partum, 
leading to the critical extension of the state plan amendment for 
Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) 12-month post-
partum coverage. \3\ This year, effective March 1st, 2024, Texas 
extended postpartum coverage to the full 12 months for eligible 
Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) recipients 
through the Texas Health and Human Services Commission.

    I cannot stress enough the importance of continuing bipartisan work 
to reduce disparities and improve outcomes, as well as bolster our 
public health workforce. Throughout the years, I've developed great 
working relationships with Members such as Reps. Lisa Blunt Rochester, 
Robin Kelly, and Danny Davis. It is through these great partnerships 
that we influence and expand our understanding of health care policy in 
the Nation. With that knowledge, it is my belief that Congress should 
examine the effectiveness of our existing programs and determine what 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
changes may be necessary to achieve these goals.

    Congress has an important role, but so do community/physician-led 
efforts. The work of Congress should be informed by what's happening on 
the ground. It is our passion and work that define who we are and leave 
a lasting imprint on Capitol Hill, shaping policies, building 
relationships, and fostering change that impacts the lives of countless 
American patients.

    Thank you for having me today and for holding this hearing on such 
important topics. It has been a privilege to discuss my work and 
experience with you.

    The Chair. Well, thank you very much, Congressman Burgess. 
Thank you very much, Senator Butler. We appreciate your 
testimony and your excellent work. We will now hear from our 
second panel. Thank you. Let me thank all of our knowledgeable 
panelists for being with us this morning.

    We have five panelists, Dr. Yolanda Lawson, Dr. Samuel 
Cook, Dr. Michael Galvez, Dr. Jaines--Jaines Andrades, and Dr. 
Brian Stone. And we thank all of them for being here. Our first 
witness will be Dr. Yolanda Lawson.

    She is President of the National Medical Association, the 
largest organization representing Black physicians. Dr. Lawson 
is an OB-GYN who is committed to addressing health inequities 
and improving diversity among physicians.

    She is also committed to eliminating maternal health 
disparities. Dr. Lawson, thanks so much for being with us.

STATEMENT OF YOLANDA LAWSON, M.D., PRESIDENT, NATIONAL MEDICAL 
                    ASSOCIATION, DALLAS, TX

    Dr. Lawson. Thank you. Good morning----

    The Chair. Is your mic on? Press the button.

    Dr. Lawson. Okay. Good morning, Chairman Sanders and 
Ranking Member, Dr. Cassidy, and Members of the Committee.

    Thank you for the opportunity to appear before the 
Committee to discuss this critical issue, addressing the 
shortage of racial minoritized health care professionals and 
maternal health disparities.

    I am Dr. Yolanda Lawson, and I am testifying today as an 
OB-GYN practicing in Dallas, Texas, and founder of MadeWell 
OBGYN and MadeWell Woman, which is a birthing center. I am 
currently the Executive Medical Director for Maternal Infant 
Health at Healthcare Services Corporation.

    Today, I speak to you primarily in my capacity as the 
President of the National Medical Association. We are the 
largest and oldest national organization representing more than 
50,000 African American physicians and the patients they serve 
of all racial and ethnic backgrounds. As a physician, my first 
duty is to the health of my patients.

    As NMA President, my first duty is to fulfill our mission 
to eliminate health disparities in this country. The sad fact 
is, African Americans, as well as other people of color, are 
not as healthy as their white counterparts. African Americans 
experience the lowest life expectancies across a myriad of 
health care outcomes compared to White Americans, irrespective 
of their socioeconomic status.

    Research demonstrates that such inequities in health 
outcomes have existed since Federal recordkeeping began, and 
they cannot be explained solely by socioeconomic differences, 
and they are largely preventable through structural 
interventions and through the implementation of equitable 
health policy and measures before a prospective patient even 
enters a traditional medical setting.

    In 2020, our Nation watched in horror as Black people died 
disproportionately in high numbers from COVID-19. That 
extraordinary moment spotlighted a chronic problem of the 
ongoing health disparities that exist for Blacks in this 
country.

    Black people are disproportionately affected by virtually 
every major chronic disease, including diabetes, high blood 
pressure, and obesity. Even more disturbing are disparities in 
maternal health. You all know the numbers.

    Black women are more than--are 3 to 4 times more likely to 
die from pregnancy related complications than white women, and 
maternal health disparities persist as a pressing public health 
challenge in the United States despite advances in medical 
technology and health care delivery.

    These disparities are not solely attributable to 
socioeconomic factors but are deeply rooted in systemic racism 
and unequal treatment, bias, and inadequate access to quality 
health care. This is just--this is not just a matter of equity 
or fairness.

    When there are more sick people in our Nation, such an 
imbalance dynamic creates a bigger burden on our health care 
system, reduces workforce productivity, increases disability, 
and raises medical costs that ultimately we all pay for, 
whether through Medicare, Medicaid, or other high health 
insurance premiums.

    Avoidable health disparities are deeply rooted in the 
operationalization of structural and systemic racism and 
discrimination and in the persistence of unequal access to 
quality health care. Each of these elements erodes a patient's 
health care experience and diminishes their ability to make the 
best choices in support of their health today and across their 
lifetime.

    Today, I would like to emphasize a critical piece of the 
American health care puzzle, the shortage of Black physicians. 
Research consistently demonstrates that patients from racial 
and ethnic minority backgrounds experience better outcomes when 
treated by health care providers who share their racial ethnic 
backgrounds.

    In short, patients can have better health outcomes when 
their doctors look like them. Yet Black doctors remain vastly 
underrepresented. Representation is critical, and Black 
physicians and health care providers are more likely to 
understand the unique challenges that Black patients--that 
affect Black patients' health.

    Black patients are more likely to trust and comply with the 
recommendations of a Black physician. This country has a legacy 
of distrust among African American--among American health care 
institutions, rather well or perceived, and this is rooted in 
historical abuses of power.

    70 percent of all Black physicians in the U.S. today 
attended HBCUs. In the 20th--in the early 20th century, we know 
that number was reduced after the Flexner Report was released. 
Instead of addressing those concerns about the quality of 
education at HBCU medical schools, the AMA allowed them to 
close.

    We know that likely the number of Black physicians in this 
country today would be more proportionate to the Black 
population if those institutions had remained open. The NMA 
believes we must create pathway programs to address inequities 
in the education system.

    We must address financial constraints. For many Black 
students, medical school is a financial impossibility. We 
support programs such as the National Health Service Corps. And 
as for resources, for the HBCU medical schools to address 
education and infrastructure, medical schools must adopt more 
holistic admission processes.

    We must address the higher attrition rates among medical--
Black medical students and residents. We advocate, in regard to 
maternal health, a companion bill from the Senate to the Black 
Maternal Momnibus Act to focus on preventable maternal 
mortality.

    Finally, we must take steps to reduce the bias in our 
health care system by establishing regional centers of 
excellence to address implicit bias and cultural competency in 
health professions settings like Senator Durbin and Robin--
Representative Robin Kelly's Care for Moms Act.

    I believe we are at a turning point in my lifetime. Two 
major events have significantly exposed the disparities between 
the health of Black people compared to those of our white 
counterparts, the COVID-19 pandemic and Hurricane Katrina.

    Both catastrophic events revealed the glaring health 
inequities that are present in our Country. There is much work 
to do, but we also have a historic opportunity to change the 
story. Thank you, Senator.

    Greetings Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Bill Cassidy, M.D., and 
Members of the Committee.

    Thank you for the opportunity to appear before the Committee to 
discuss this critical issue: addressing the shortage of minority 
healthcare professionals.

    My name is Yolanda Lawson, M.D. I am testifying today as an OB-GYN 
practicing in Dallas, Texas, and as the President of the National 
Medical Association, the largest and oldest national organization 
representing the interests of more than 50,000 African American 
physicians and the patients they serve.

    I am the founder of MadeWell OBGYN in Dallas and MadeWell Woman, a 
birthing center. I am currently the Executive Medical Director, 
Maternal Infant Health at HealthCare Services Corp.

    As a physician, my first duty is to the health of my patients. As 
NMA president, my first priority is to represent the needs of Black 
physicians and Black communities in this country.

    The sad fact is: Patients who are African American, as well as 
other people of color, are not as healthy as their white (non-minority 
counterparts.) And these disparities have existed since Federal 
recordkeeping began.

    The COVID-19 pandemic brought this issue to the forefront. In 2020, 
the entire nation watched in horror as members of the Black community 
accounted for a disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths.

    That was an extraordinary situation but reflected a chronic issue. 
Black people are disproportionately affected by every major chronic 
disease (excluding those with a genetic basis). They are 2.2 more 
likely to have diabetes. According to the CDC Black infants 2.4 times 
the mortality of White infants. African-Americans have the highest 
mortality rates of any racial or ethnic group for all cancers combined 
and most major cancers. Black people are more likely to die of heart 
disease than any other group. Black women are 60 percent more likely to 
have high blood pressure compared to White women.

    Other disparities include ``higher uninsured rates, being more 
likely to go without care due to cost, and worse reported health 
status. The life expectancy of Black people is nearly 5 years shorter 
compared to White people (72.8 years vs. 77.5 years).''

    Even more disturbing are disparities in maternal health. Black 
women continue to experience disproportionately high rates of maternal 
morbidity and mortality compared to white counterparts. The Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that Black women are three 
to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications 
than white women.
          MATERNAL HEALTH DISPARITIES: A PERSISTENT CHALLENGE
    Maternal health disparities persist as a pressing public health 
challenge in the United States. Despite advances in medical technology 
and healthcare delivery, Black women continue to experience 
disproportionately high rates of maternal morbidity and mortality 
compared to their white counterparts. The Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) reports that Black women are three to four times 
more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white 
women. These disparities are not solely attributable to socioeconomic 
factors but are deeply rooted in systemic racism, implicit bias, and 
unequal access to quality healthcare.

    This is not just a matter of equity. The commitment to safe 
birthing processes and positive health outcomes affects everyone, not 
just mothers. When there are more sick people, that creates a bigger 
burden on our healthcare system, less productivity for the affected 
workforce, and higher medical costs that ultimately, we all pay for, 
whether through higher health insurance premiums or tax dollars for 
Medicare and Medicaid. In 2019, it was noted that the impacts of 
maternal morbidity cost the United States $32.3 billion.

    To address this problem, we must understand why it's happening. 
These disparities are not attributable solely to socioeconomic factors. 
Nor is there a genetic or biologic basis. They are deeply rooted in a 
myriad of factors that include systemic racism, implicit bias, and 
unequal access to quality healthcare. But one key factor, which I'd 
like to address in depth, is the shortage of Black physicians.
                          MORE BLACK PROVIDERS
    Research consistently demonstrates that patients from racial and 
ethnic minority backgrounds experience better health outcomes when 
treated by healthcare providers who share their racial and ethnic 
backgrounds. In short, patients can have better outcomes when their 
doctors look like them.

    Yet Black doctors remain vastly underrepresented relative to their 
proportion of the U.S. population. Despite long-standing efforts to 
increase minority representation in our physician workforce, gains have 
been minimal. African American and Black people represent only 5.7 
percent of physicians--which means they are grossly underrepresented 
relative to the roughly 13.6 percent of Americans who are Black.

    Physicians, of course, are only part of the healthcare workforce. 
Recently, the NMA's Annual Colloquium convened the presidents of all 
the major organizations of Black healthcare providers, including Black 
nurses, Black pharmacists, Black registered dieticians, and Black 
physical therapists, Black Dentists and Black Psychologists. We all 
agreed: Ensuring the future of a diverse workforce is critical to 
ending healthcare disparities.

    Why is representation so important? Why do Black patients seem to 
do better when they see Black physicians?

    One reason is that Black physicians and healthcare providers are 
more likely to understand the unique challenges that influence Black 
patients' health outcomes. Also, Black patients are more likely to 
trust the advice of a Black physician or provider and comply with the 
physician's recommendations. Sociocultural understanding and improved 
communication can lead to better quality of care. Studies indicate that 
Black infants are 3 times more likely to die than non-Hispanic white 
infants, however that number decreases by half when they are seen by a 
Black doctor. Similarly, cardiovascular deaths in Black men are reduced 
by 19 percent when they are seen by a Black physician.

    Trust is critical in creating positive health outcomes and there is 
a legacy of distrust in our community. This history of distrust is 
understandable given the history of healthcare delivery and research in 
the United States. The Tuskegee syphilis study is widely recognized as 
one key reason for this mistrust. However, studies suggest that the 
history of medical and research abuse of African Americans goes well 
beyond Tuskegee.

    Distrust has so many repercussions and costs. Despite mandates by 
the Federal Government to ensure inclusion of women and minorities in 
all federally funded research, African Americans continue to 
participate less frequently than Whites. Lower participation rates 
among African Americans have been reported across various study types 
(e.g., controlled clinical treatment trials, intervention trials, as 
well as studies on various disease conditions, including AIDS, 
Alzheimer's disease, prostate cancer and other malignancies, stroke, 
and cardiovascular disease). Black people don't enroll in research 
studies because of that legacy of distrust. The presence of more Black 
physicians could begin to repair some of that distrust.

    Black physicians and healthcare providers can advocate for 
equitable healthcare policies and practices within the healthcare 
system.
                         UNDERSTANDING BARRIERS
    Several challenges persist for young Black people who aspire to 
become physicians:

    Structural barriers--including limited access to medical school 
education, financial constraints, pervasive discrimination within 
academic and healthcare settings--all hinder the recruitment, retention 
and advancement of Black medical students, residents and practitioners.

    It is important to note the role of historically Black colleges and 
universities (HBCUs), which have represented an important piece in the 
pipeline. Nearly three-quarters--70 percent--of all Black physicians in 
the U.S. attended HBCU medical schools.

    At one time, there were seven HBCU medical schools. However, five 
of those seven were shuttered after the 1910 release of the Flexner 
Report, commissioned by Carnegie Corporation and the American Medical 
Association's (AMA)'s Council on Medical Education. In 1910, Flexner 
published his report with devastating consequences for the numbers of 
Black doctors. He recommended shuttering five of the seven historically 
Black medical schools that trained the vast majority of Black 
physicians. Within 2 years of the Flexner Report, three Black medical 
schools closed, and by 1924, only two such schools remained.

    Flexner claimed the Black medical schools were substandard. His 
biased thinking suggested that Black medical schools existed primarily 
to keep Black citizens from spreading contagious disease to the white 
population. The U.S. has yet to fully recover from this loss as there 
are now only four HBCU medical schools.

    More critically, instead of providing assistance to help raise the 
quality of education at these schools, the AMA allowed them to close. 
Had they remained open, likely the number of Black physicians in this 
country today would be comparable to the size of the Black population, 
and more importantly, the tragic health disparities I've described 
would be much less.
HERE ARE SOME STEPS THAT NMA BELIEVES MUST BE TAKEN TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS 
                    THE SHORTAGE OF BLACK PHYSICIANS
        (1). Address barriers and inequities in the education system 
        that prevent talented Black students from getting to medical 
        schools, beginning with early childhood, through elementary and 
        secondary school and pre-medical education at the undergraduate 
        level.

                (a). Black, Hispanic and Native American students are 
                more likely to have parents without a college degree 
                and more likely to attend a low-resourced college.

                (b). Not only does that affect their ability to compete 
                in the admissions process . . . these factors trickle 
                down to social networks, limiting opportunities that 
                affect their ability to succeed as medical students.

                (c). For example, one study found that students of 
                color were less likely to have shadowed a physician--an 
                experience that can burnish a med school application.

                (d). Pathway programs should offer early interventions 
                and exposure to medical disciplines.

        (2). Address financial constraints through scholarship 
        opportunities and additional funding for low-income students. A 
        student who is the first in their family to attend college, or 
        who works 20 hours a week to pay expenses while attending 
        college, faces an uphill battle. It's much more difficult for 
        those students to earn the same GPA and MCAT scores as a 
        student who doesn't have those constraints. NMA has established 
        a Million Dollar Scholarship Challenge to help address that 
        need--but it's just a start. The burden of student debt 
        disproportionately affects Black physicians, further 
        exacerbating existing socioeconomic disparities.

        (3). Ensure that guidance counselors at the high school level, 
        and pre-med advisors at the undergraduate level, encourage and 
        support Black students who aspire to medical careers. Black 
        students are more likely to face discouragement from advisers 
        when applying to medical school compared to their white 
        counterparts. Instead of discouragement, they need support and 
        resources.

        (4). Create a more holistic admission process for medical 
        school. Medical schools must expand their recruitment targets 
        to include ``added values'' that underrepresented and racially 
        minoritized individuals can bring to a training program or a 
        department. Admission tests and grades don't tell the whole 
        story. To quote the American Medical Association (AMA)--
        ``Scoring highly on the Medical College Admissions Test 
        (MCAT)--one of the primary measurements used in consideration 
        of medical student admission by medical schools--doesn't mean 
        you'll become a great, or even a good, doctor.'' The AMA report 
        adds: ``Overreliance on just one measure of performance, such 
        as the MCAT, risks missing a pool of candidates with other 
        valuable attributes to contribute to the health care system.'' 
        Aspiring Black medical school candidates have valuable 
        attributes to contribute. They relate to Black patients and 
        they contribute to better health outcomes. An admission process 
        that overlooks that potential could exclude some of our best 
        future doctors.

        (5). Increase the number of residency positions.

        (6). Address the issue of higher attrition rates among Black 
        medical students and residents. These are students who managed 
        to overcome barriers to get into medical school and on to 
        residency. We need to understand what's keeping them from 
        meeting these final hurdles and how we can better support them.

        (7). Address the especially severe shortage of Black men in 
        medicine through continued support of funding for graduate 
        medical education. Black men make up less than 3 percent of the 
        overall physician population. This disturbing numbers stems 
        from a history economic disadvantages and systemic racism.

        (8). Continue and enhance programs in medical schools aimed at 
        improving diversity. We've seen a backlash of late against DEI 
        programs in medical schools. We cannot repeat the mistakes of 
        the Flexner report. As HBCUs produce 70 percent of Black 
        doctors, it is paramount that we continue to support these 
        institutions and support increases in graduate medical 
        education funding.
                            CLOSING COMMENTS
    I believe we are at a turning point. In our lifetime, we have 
experienced two major life events that have significantly exposed the 
disparities between the health of Black people compared to those of our 
white counterparts: the COVID-19 pandemic and Hurricane Katrina. Both 
catastrophic events revealed the glaring health inequities that are 
present in our Country. I believe we have the awareness and the 
political will to begin to create change.

    As I said before, this is more than a matter of equity. It's not 
just about representation and fairness. It's about life and death. It's 
about the health of millions of Black Americans.

    There is much work to do, but there is also an opportunity to 
change the story.
                                 ______
                                 
                 [summary statement of yolanda lawson]
    The healthcare workforce and reproductive justice are not only key 
policy foci of the NMA but of myself personally. Representing the needs 
of Black communities is paramount in a time where we face some of the 
worst health outcomes in the country. Black people are 
disproportionately affected by every major chronic disease and have a 
much higher likelihood of maternal mortality. Additionally, distrust in 
the healthcare system has a longstanding history amongst Black 
Americans, which creates additional barriers in receiving quality care. 
Sociocultural understanding and improved communication have been proven 
to lead to increased patient adherence to healthcare guidelines and 
higher patient satisfaction, which results in better health outcomes. 
Research continues to show that racial concordant care is key to 
improved health outcomes for minority communities, however, due to a 
history of racial and systemic barriers, the number of Black doctors in 
the United States is staggeringly low. The United States has been 
facing a physician shortage for several years, but especially with 
Black doctors, who represent only 5.7 percent of doctors in the 
country. The COVID-19 pandemic further exasperated these shortages and 
brought them to the forefront. The shortage has resulted in lack of 
access to receiving care, especially in rural and low-income 
communities, extraordinarily long wait times to receive care, a lack of 
a diverse workforce, and lack of healthcare workforce retention. It is 
important to focus on providing resources to increase support for Black 
students seeking graduate medical education. 70 percent of the Black 
physicians in the United States attended Historically Black Colleges 
and Universities (HBCUs) and the existence and support of these 
institutions is critical to the pathway of increasing the number of 
Black doctors. The Flexner report severely impacted the number of HBCUs 
in our Country and we have yet to recover. By addressing barriers that 
contribute to the lack of Black physicians in the United States, we can 
begin to dismantle the systems that continue to impact the health 
outcomes of our community.
                                 ______
                                 

    The Chair. Dr. Lawson, thank you very much. Our next 
witness will be Dr. Samuel Cook, a resident physician at 
Morehouse School of Medicine. Dr. Cook received his medical 
degree from Drexel University and is an advocate for improving 
diversity of the physician workforce. Dr. Cook, thanks very 
much for being here.

 STATEMENT OF SAMUEL COOK, M.D., RESIDENT, MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF 
                     MEDICINE, ATLANTA, GA

    Dr. Cook. Thank you, sir. Senator and Chairman Sanders, 
Senators of the HELP Committee, my fellow panelists and guests, 
thank you so much for having me here today. I am Dr. Samuel 
David Cook and a PGY-3 internal medicine resident at Morehouse 
School of Medicine.

    I was born and raised in the Bronx, New York, by my two 
loving parents, Ronald Cook and Ambassador Susan Johnson Cook, 
who instilled in me a deep love of God and the impetus to serve 
those among us who are most in need.

    Though all of us in this room today are red blooded 
Americans, my journey to this platform has been anything but 
traditional. The doctors I saw as a child never looked like me, 
so I made it my life's mission to be the change I sought in 
medicine.

    During my undergraduate studies at Johns Hopkins 
University, I was told by my medical school admissions 
counselor that my above average GPA at one of our Nation's top 
ten universities was not strong enough to make medicine a 
reality.

    Nevertheless, I persisted and entered a post-baccalaureate 
pipeline program for underrepresented minorities at Drexel 
University's College of Medicine. In this Drexel pathway to 
medical school program, I thrived in the specialized and 
supportive environment and quickly excelled.

    I then graduated to become a medical student at Drexel, 
where I earned top academic awards above my peers of all races 
and published my medical research, even authoring a paper with 
decorated physicians at Harvard's medical school.

    As the things go, you can't judge a book by its cover, and 
it takes a village to raise a child. It is a fact, not an 
opinion, that historically Black colleges and universities have 
been instrumental in creating their own pipelines to medical 
schools.

    Between 2009 and 2019, HBCUs have seen the most Black 
graduates to them. Last year, HBCU medical schools produced 10 
percent of our Nation's Black doctors, while only accounting 
for 2 percent of all medical colleges.

    Assuming we beat an educational system that is stacked 
against us, many Black students are then faced with hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in student loan debt. For me, the current 
sum of medical student loan debt plus accrued interest stands 
just shy of $400,000.

    Though the costs are the same, no matter the student's 
race, the financial impact it will have on their families is 
not. Racially biased and systemic wealth inequity is an 
undeniable truth in our Nation, and one that has barred far too 
many students of color from becoming the doctors they were 
qualified to be.

    Thus, we call on you to increase funding for HBCUs to 
reduce the cost of producing high quality physicians of color. 
This is with the understanding that these institutions have a 
proven track record of incubating some of our Nation's 
brightest minds, those nearly snuffed out by the waves of 
racial bias and injustice.

    How does having a Black doctor better serve Black patients 
or save them from undue harm? I wrote in my testimony about a 
Black woman who was nearly committed and chemically and 
physically restrained, all because her medical team didn't know 
that hitting your head to scratch an itchy scalp doesn't make 
you crazy. It simply means you don't want to mess up your hair.

    How it was the presence of a Black psychiatrist that saved 
them and that hospital from what would have been justifiable 
malpractice lawsuits. So, this is not just an issue for Black 
American, Senators. This is an issue for all Americans.

    What is more, a 2016 study found that half of white medical 
trainees surveyed, 50 percent believe such myths as Black 
people have thicker skin or less sensitive nerve endings than 
white people.

    They continued, participants who endorsed these beliefs 
rated the Black patients pain as lower and made less accurate 
treatment recommendations. In this population of white medical 
students, we see evidence that negative racial biases are 
currently and have long been harming America's Black patients.

    Senators, I humbly come before you today as nothing more 
than a mouthpiece for our collective struggles. We serve 
tirelessly, Senators. We, resident physicians and medical 
students of color sacrifice our physical, mental, spiritual, 
and financial well-being to be the change in the medical field 
we so desperately seek.

    Now we ardently advocate for the reintroduction of 
legislation which would specifically fund and protect the 
growth of HBCU medical schools like that proposed by Chairman 
Sanders in 2023.

    This is what the sentiment that we make these vital 
pipelines more affordable, because the financial manacles of 
medical schooling are the greatest impediments in recruiting 
Black and Brown doctors to our workforce.

    It frightens me to think that after today, nothing will 
change to render our physician workforce more representative of 
the racial and ethnic makeup of our great nation. Therefore, I 
am challenging you, Senators, calling upon you to each assure 
the American public and your constituents that you will vote to 
support our HBCUs and empower future generations of Black and 
Brown physicians.

    The time to act is never tomorrow, Senators. It has been 
and always will be today. Thank you.

    [The prepared statement of Dr. Cook follows.]

    Senator and Chairman Sanders, Senators of the HELP Committee, my 
fellow esteemed panelists, and guests.

    Thank you so much for having me here today to speak on one of the 
most critical issues in the U.S. Healthcare system as it currently 
stands.

    I am Dr. Samuel David Cook, a PGY-3 Internal Medicine Resident 
Physician at The Morehouse School of Medicine. I was born and raised in 
the Bronx, NY, by my two loving parents, Ronald Cook and Ambassador 
Suzan Johnson Cook, who instilled in me a deep love of God, and the 
impetus to serve those among us who are most in need.

    We come here today for an awesomely important purpose: to recognize 
the shortage of Black doctors currently in the American workforce, to 
understand why it is an issue, and to identify actionable steps that 
you may take as Congress to rectify this gap.

    Though all of us in this room today are red-blooded Americans, my 
journey to this platform has been anything but traditional. I grew up 
in a neighborhood that was inherently sick, underserved from the most 
critical healthcare needs. The doctors I saw as a child never looked 
like me, so I made it my life's mission to be the change I sought in 
medicine. During my undergraduate studies at Johns Hopkins University, 
I was told by my medical school admissions counselor that my above-
average GPA at one of our Nation's top ten universities was not strong 
enough to make medicine a reality. Nevertheless, I persisted and 
entered a post-baccalaureate pipeline program for under-represented 
minorities at Drexel University College of Medicine. In this Drexel 
Pathway to Medical School Program (DPMS), I thrived in the specialized 
and supportive environment, and quickly excelled. I then graduated to 
become a medical student at Drexel, where I earned top academic awards 
above my peers of all races, and published my medical research, even 
authoring a paper with decorated physicians at Harvard Medical School. 
As the sayings go, ``You can't judge a book by its cover,'' and ``it 
takes a village to raise a child.''

    While I do not have as many years of experience as my colleagues 
testifying today, I do possess the benefit of recency in pursuing a 
medical career.

    What is the true measure of a physician? Is it how well they score 
on a standardized exam, or is it the care and poise with which they 
utilize such knowledge? I submit to you today that high-quality medical 
care necessitates qualified, yet compassionate and culturally competent 
physicians.

    Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have been 
instrumental in creating pipelines to medical schools. Between 2009 and 
2019, HBCUs sent the most Black graduates to medical schools. According 
to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), ``Howard and 
Morehouse graduated more than 400 each over this time period, while no 
predominantly white institution graduated as many as 300.'' Of the 
three undergraduate institutions supplying medical colleges with the 
most Black entrants in 2023, ``two were HBCUs--Howard (first) and 
Xavier (third).'' Additionally, HBCU Medical Schools produced 10 
percent of our Nation's Black doctors last year while only accounting 
for 2 percent of all medical colleges.

    Assuming we beat an educational system that is stacked against us, 
Black medical students have one of the most difficult and potentially 
injurious decisions facing them: Should I assume hundreds of thousands 
of dollars in student-loan debt without any guarantee I will actually 
become a practicing physician? For me, the current sum of medical 
student loan debt and accrued interest stands just shy of $400,000. 
Though the costs are the same no matter the student's race, the 
financial impact it will have on their family is not. Racially based 
and systemic wealth inequity is an undeniable truth in our Nation, and 
one that has barred too many students of color from becoming the 
doctors they were qualified to be.

    Acceptance into medical school and matriculation through residency 
are crucial pain points when looking at the employment gap, but 
retention and support are, nevertheless, equally as important. We are 
often bound by our debts to work in hospitals in which we may not be 
equally supported, or worse, face reprimand at unjustly higher rates 
than our peers. One 2020 study published in JAMA Surgery found that 
over 70 percent of Black surgical residents who were surveyed faced 
discrimination during their residency. Another showed that ``Black 
trainees accounted for only 5 percent of all residents in 2016 but 20 
percent of those who were dismissed from a residency program.'' Thus, 
we call on you to increase funding for HBCUs to reduce the cost of 
producing high-quality physicians of color. This is with the 
understanding that these institutions have a proven track record of 
incubating some of our Nation's brightest minds, those nearly snuffed 
out by the waves of racial bias and injustice.

    How does a black doctor better serve Black patients, or save them 
from undo harm? I will give an especially poignant example. I was 
informed of the particularly harrowing story of a Black patient at one 
of our area's hospitals. She was seen furiously hitting her head, to 
the degree that her medical staff were alarmed, insisting that the 
patient be placed under a psychiatric hold as they judged she was a 
direct harm to herself. When the Black female Psychiatrist went to the 
bedside to see this patient, she immediately indicated to the rest of 
the medical team that the patient was, in fact, not harming herself, 
but simply patting her head because that is how you scratch an itchy 
scalp without messing up your hair. Had a Black physician not 
intervened in this instance, that patient was on a pathway to being 
chemically or physically restrained, and that hospital and staff would 
have justifiably faced a malpractice lawsuit. So, this is not just an 
issue for Black Americans, it is an issue for all Americans.

    Senators, cultural competence directly saves our patients' lives 
and well-being. It protects them from the perils of physicians who have 
sheltered in their own cultural bubbles without true understanding of 
the diverse communities they serve.

    What's more, a 2016 study published in the Proceedings of the 
National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) found that ``Half of white medical 
trainees [surveyed] believe such myths as Black people have thicker 
skin or less sensitive nerve endings than white people.'' They 
continue, ``participants who endorsed these beliefs rated the Black 
(vs. white) patient's pain as lower and made less accurate treatment 
recommendations.'' In this population of white medical students, we see 
evidence that negative racial biases are currently, and have long been, 
harming America's Black patients.

    To support our efforts further, I ardently advocate for the re-
introduction of legislation which would specifically fund and protect 
the growth of HBCU medical schools, similar to that proposed by 
Chairman Sanders in 2023.

    Senators, though I have faced my own substantial tribulations on 
the path to becoming a physician, I humbly come before you today as 
nothing more than a voice for our collective troubles. We serve, 
tirelessly, Senators. We resident physicians and medical students of 
color sacrifice our physical, mental, spiritual, and financial well-
being to be the change in the medical field we so desperately seek. We 
physicians, residents, and medical students of color humbly ask that 
you increase spending on medical education at HBCU medical colleges, 
because the financial manacles of medical schooling are the greatest 
impediments in recruiting Black and Brown doctors to our workforce. 
Americans need us in these roles to provide the high-quality, 
culturally competent care they require. So let's work together to fund 
the new wave of Black and Brown physicians our Country, including you 
all, will need in the future. The time to act is never tomorrow, 
Senators; it has been, and always will be, today.

    Growing up in the Bronx, NY, my parents instilled in me a deep 
sense of duty to help those in need, casting my journey into medicine. 
Nevertheless, I have encountered and overcome numerous challenges on my 
path to serving others. Despite facing recurrent discouragement, 
particularly during my undergraduate education, I remained steadfast in 
my commitment to advocating for underserved communities and healing 
other families as if they were my own.

    Through programs like the Drexel Pathway to Medical School (DPMS) 
Program, I have been blessed to educationally excel, and recognize the 
crucial role of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in 
nurturing diverse talent within the medical field. However, I have 
directly witnessed the disproportionate impact of student loan debt on 
medical students of color, hindering their access to and progression 
within medicine. Nevertheless, my journey is just one among many. I 
believe that, by working together, we can overcome these obstacles and 
create a brighter future for healthcare in America.

    As an Internal Medicine Resident Physician at Morehouse School of 
Medicine, my experiences have led me to recognize the urgent need for 
change in the medical field. Despite the progress we have made thus 
far, there is much work to be done. Moreover, there are still far too 
many barriers preventing individuals of underrepresented backgrounds 
from pursuing and thriving in healthcare careers.

    In light of these challenges, I humbly urge Congress to expand 
support for HBCU medical schools, and establish a fund to directly 
increase their available resources. By amplifying support for HBCUs and 
implementing targeted initiatives, we can empower the next generation 
of diverse medical professionals and ensure equitable access to quality 
care for all. These steps are essential to addressing systemic barriers 
in medicine, ensuring a more inclusive healthcare landscape where all 
patients receive culturally competent care.

    In advocating for change, I am not just speaking for myself, but 
for countless others who have faced similar struggles. Together, we can 
work toward a healthcare system that reflects the rich diversity of our 
Nation and meets the needs of every patient, regardless of their 
background or circumstance. It is time, Senators, to acknowledge the 
shortcomings of our current healthcare system, and turn our collective 
focus to the action needed to revive it.

    The Chair. Thank you very much, Dr. Cook. Our next witness 
will be Dr. Michael Galvez, who specializes in pediatric 
reconstructive hand surgery in Madero, California. Dr. Galvez 
co-created the National Latino Physician Day, and the phrase 6 
percent is not enough, to bring attention to the need to 
diversify the physician workforce. Dr. Galvez, thanks so much 
for being with us.

STATEMENT OF MICHAEL GALVEZ, M.D., VALLEY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL; 
    CO-CREATOR OF NATIONAL LATINO PHYSICIAN DAY, MADERA, CA

    Dr. Galvez. Buenos Dias, Chairman Sanders and Ranking 
Member Cassidy. Thank you for having me here today. My name is 
Dr. Michael Galvez, and I stand before you as a husband, 
father, son of Peruvian immigrants, a surgeon, and an advocate 
for Mi Comunidad, My Latino Community.

    I am honored to serve as a pediatric hand surgeon to help 
children with complex hand conditions at Valley Children's 
Hospital in the Central Valley of California, a region with 
significant disparity and need for high quality care. Hablo 
Espanol todo los dias. I speak Spanish every day with my 
patients.

    In my practice of medicine, I have come to recognize that 
my language and culture are as valuable as my training at 
prestigious universities. There is nothing like seeing a face 
of a Latino child's mother when I come through a clinic door 
and begin speaking Spanish, alleviating fear as their first 
encounter with a physician that speaks el idioma, the language.

    I see complex problems, and having the superpower of 
language proficiency and understanding the culture adds clarity 
and connection. After working at medical institutions across 
the United States, I have asked myself constantly, why don't I 
see more students and faculty like myself?

    For that reason, I helped co-found National Latino 
Physician Day, celebrated on October 1st, along with Stanford 
Obstetric Anesthesiologist Dr. Cesar Padilla, to spotlight the 
underrepresentation of Latinos and Latinas in medicine.

    This effort has rapidly evolved into a movement supported 
by the National Hispanic Medical Association, the Latino 
Medical Student Association, and nearly every medical 
organization in this country and multiple hospital systems 
across the country.

    We rally behind the motto, 6 percent is not enough, in 
recognition of the public health crisis affecting our 
community. Despite being the largest minority group in the 
United States, Latinos represent only 6.9 percent of the 
physician workforce, which is a big contrast to almost 20 
percent representation in the Nation's population and nearly 40 
percent in the States of California and Texas.

    There are not enough physicians to provide high quality 
care to communities that are the backbone to our economy--and 
overrepresented in difficult professions such as agriculture 
and construction. Latinos in the U.S. have the fifth largest 
gross domestic product in the world, GDP.

    However, limited access to health care, face language, and 
cultural barriers experience poorer cancer and maternal health 
outcomes and had increased COVID-19 mortality during the 
pandemic. This deeply burdens the Nation's social safety nets, 
more missed school days for children, and lower productivity, 
which really stunts the potential of our Country.

    Our hospitals, our institutions, medical schools, and 
indeed, Congress have the ethical responsibility to address the 
underrepresentation of Latino physicians to meet the needs of a 
growing Latino population, which is estimated to comprise one-
third of the population by 2050. But the journey to medicine is 
full of socioeconomic barriers, especially for Latino and 
minority students.

    In my journey, community college education was key to my 
success, but it can really just be the--it is really the only 
educational option for some students. To expand the percentage 
of Latino physicians and minority physicians in general, it is 
critical to meet them where they are, and that is in our 
Nation's community colleges.

    The commercialization of medical school admissions and the 
reliance on standardized tests, such as the MCAT, overlooks the 
potential of a compassionate and capable physician candidate. 
Having helped excellent students navigate these waters, I am in 
disbelief when they are not recruited, despite our physician 
shortage.

    The National Latino Physician Day highlights the persistent 
shortage of Latino physicians, which underscores the need for 
change and opportunities for action that Congress can take. 
First, expand funding for pathway programs and new medical 
school programs.

    We can increase the minority physician workforce by 
recognizing the value of lived experience of Latino identified 
individuals through pathway programs that begin at community 
colleges, earlier exposures to medicine, and advocate for 
holistic medical school admissions.

    We need a bilingual and bicultural medical school anchored 
in a Hispanic serving institution, partnered with local 
hospitals. We can start with regional satellites of medical 
schools in predominantly Latino areas of California.

    We also should not be ignoring language. Language 
proficiency by physicians is a proven strategy for improving 
patient outcomes demonstrated by the UCLA Latino Policy and 
Politics Institute, which has shown that concordant language 
enhances compliance with treatment plans and medication 
adherence.

    Mandating medical schools to value bilingual skills and 
community college background by tying medical school funding 
and NIH grants to admission practices that prioritize these 
elements.

    This will drive medical schools to align more closely to 
their local, underserved areas. For example, the University of 
California could be mandated to recruit, accept, and retain 
these qualified students to take care of those underserved 
populations.

    Finally, funding loan repayment programs. In California, I 
am grateful to be the recipient of a Cal Healthcare's loan 
repayment to serve patients on Medi-Cal. But federally, the 
National Health Service Corps is essential to attract and 
retain physicians in underserved areas, ensuring equitable 
health care access.

    We can no longer allow the status quo from our medical 
schools. As the Latino population increases, we must confront 
this public health crisis head on. Necesitamos mas, we need 
more. Thank you so much.

                 [summary statement of michael galvez]
    Good morning, Chairman Sanders and Ranking Member Cassidy.

    My name is Dr. Michael Galvez, a proud husband, father, and 
Pediatric Hand surgeon. As a son of Peruvian immigrants and an advocate 
for my Latino community, I am privileged to work at Valley Children's 
Hospital in California's Central Valley, a region that faces 
significant health disparities.

    I communicate daily in Spanish, the native language of many of my 
patients, allowing me to connect with them. This linguistic ability, 
paired with an understanding of my culture, proves as invaluable as my 
academic qualifications from prestigious institutions. The relief 
visible on the faces of Latino families when they interact with a 
Spanish-speaking doctor highlights the profound impact of language and 
culture.

    Despite my experiences across various U.S. medical institutions, I 
frequently reflect on the scarcity of Latino faculty and students in 
medicine. This observation led me to co-found National Latino Physician 
Day on October 1st, along with Dr. Cesar Padilla from Stanford. This 
initiative, now supported by key medical associations nationwide, 
focuses on the underrepresentation of Latinos in the medical field. We 
rally around the slogan ``6 percent is not enough!'' acknowledging a 
public health crisis within our community. Latinos constitute the 
largest minority group in the U.S., yet make up just 6.9 percent of the 
physician workforce. This discrepancy is stark, considering Latinos 
represent nearly 20 percent of the U.S. population and significantly 
more in States like California and Texas. The shortage of Latino 
physicians exacerbates the lack of access to quality healthcare in our 
communities, which form an essential part of the national economy. Our 
community's economic contribution is immense, being the fifth-largest 
GDP globally if considered independently. Yet, we face limited 
healthcare access, language barriers, and poorer outcomes in conditions 
like cancer and maternal health. It is not just a matter of healthcare 
but of national productivity and potential. Medical institutions, along 
with Congress, hold an ethical obligation to address this imbalance to 
support the growing Latino population, projected to reach one-third of 
the U.S. by 2050.

    The path to increasing Latino representation in medicine is 
hindered by socioeconomic barriers. Community colleges, often the only 
higher education avenue available to many, were instrumental in my own 
medical journey.

    Several actions are crucial for Congress to consider:

    (1). Expand Funding for Pathway Programs and New Medical School 
Programs. We can increase the minority physician workforce by 
recognizing and valuing the lived experiences of Latino identified 
individuals through pathway programs that start at community colleges, 
early exposures to medicine, and advocate for holistic medical school 
admissions. We need a Bilingual and Bicultural Medical School anchored 
in a Hispanic Serving Institution partnered with local hospitals. We

underserved areas, ensuring equitable healthcare access.

    We need more dedicated professionals who reflect the communities 
they serve. Thank you for your attention to this public health crisis.

    The Chair. Thank you very much, Dr. Galvez. Senator 
Cassidy, do you want to introduce your panelists?

    Senator Cassidy. Yes. My pleasure to introduce doctor--I am 
sorry. Dr. Jaines Andrades, who is a certified Nurse 
Practitioner who completed her doctor--nurse practitioner at 
Elms College 2020 and her Bachelor of Science in Nursing from 
Elms College in 2014.

    She is a native of Springfield, Massachusetts, dedicated 
her professional career to caring for vulnerable populations 
with addiction, mental illness, and chronic disease. She 
credits her pre-nursing experiences in the hospital setting as 
a catalyst to pursuing a career in health care.

    Her clinical experience as a registered nurse began as a 
correctional nurse for the Hampton County Sheriff's Department, 
where she conducted mental health evaluations and incorporated 
a multidisciplinary approach to care.

    Later joined the Baystate Mason Square Neighborhood Clinic, 
providing drug and alcohol abuse nursing care. She enhanced her 
clinical skills as an inpatient staff nurse and joined Baystate 
Medical Center team as a trauma surgery nurse practitioner in 
September 2020.

    Her commitment to be a voice for the disenfranchised has 
allowed her to be a change agent and a role model for others. 
Dr. Andrades, thank you for being here.

      STATEMENT OF JAINES ANDRADES, DNP, AGACNP-BC, NURSE 
         PRACTITIONER, BAYSTATE HEALTH, SPRINGFIELD, MA

    Ms. Andrades. Chairman Sanders and Ranking Member, Dr. 
Cassidy, I am Jaines Andrades, a nurse practitioner in trauma 
surgery at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, 
Massachusetts.

    It is an honor to present my testimony before you today, 
and I thank you for the opportunity and your attention to 
addressing the shortage of minority health care professionals.

    I want to tell you a bit of my experience and offer you 
some insight into ways I believe Congress can help increase the 
number of minority health care workers in the future. I went to 
high school in Springfield, Massachusetts, at Putnam High 
School, an urban vocational school.

    I was enrolled in the cosmetology program but had dreams of 
becoming a lawyer. At that time, I struggled to figure out how 
to make this dream come true, coming from a single parent home 
where my mother didn't have the means to save for college or 
law school.

    I was fortunate, though she did have the drive to instill a 
strong work ethic and the foresight to encourage me to 
contemplate my talents and choose a career which would offer 
economic stability.

    One day at a medical appointment with my mom, a nurse 
started talking to me about the opportunities her nursing could 
offer. I was intrigued. To get a better sense of how I would 
fare on the path to becoming a nurse, I started taking courses 
at Holyoke Community College.

    I took prerequisites for the nursing program and eventually 
enrolled to Elms College to earn my Bachelor's of Nursing. 
While I was going to school, I wanted to support myself and 
thought taking a job at a hospital to get my foot in the door 
and learn more about health care would benefit me in the long 
run.

    I began working in environmental services as a custodian at 
Baystate Medical Center. I worked to keep surgery and procedure 
rooms clean. This allowed me to see firsthand what nurses did, 
what I would need to know moving ahead in the health care 
environment, and to get advice on how to proceed in my career.

    My colleagues offered incredible insight into ways I could 
fund my education. They pointed me toward resources like the 
Western Mass Community Foundation, where I had access to 
scholarships and interest free loans. Without my colleagues, I 
would not have been able to find these resources, which I 
believe were instrumental to my education. These resources need 
to be made more visible and accessible to students.

    I proceeded through my nursing school and stayed at BC 
Medical Center in Environmental Services. Eventually, I was 
hired as a nurse, once I graduated, in a community health 
center, Mason Square.

    There again, with the support of my colleagues, I was 
encouraged to earn my Doctorate of Nursing Practice. I did this 
at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was not easy, and 
eventually I was able to come full circle and take a job as a 
nurse practitioner in trauma surgery again at Baystate Medical 
Center.

    Looking back on my experience, if I could make suggestions 
to lawmakers on how to improve the shortage of minority health 
care providers, I would offer a few thoughts. First, I would 
say robust college and career planning is very critical.

    Many students at all schools, most especially those in 
lower income areas aware of health care as an attainable career 
opportunity would go so far. Letting these students know it is 
within their reach, and that there are resources available to 
them to embark on their journey to higher education is key.

    At Baystate Medical Center, we have a program called the 
Baystate Springfield Educational Partnership, or BSEP. This is 
a program for the youth in Springfield, which helps connect 
them with hospital based learning and opportunities to learn 
about different professions within the health care system.

    It allows students to engage with professionals and learn 
from them, like I did while being a custodian. But in this 
program, they are still in high school, and this option helps 
them evaluate what health care career they could select.

    I did not go through this program myself, but I would 
recommend supporting similar opportunities for minority youth 
for early professional mentorship. There are a number of 
physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners like 
myself who entered BSEP as high school students and now work 
for Baystate.

    Many of the BSEP students also fill other roles in Baystate 
while advancing their education. I believe Federal support for 
programs like this could lead to many more minority students 
embarking on prosperous careers in health care.

    Another way to make this journey more accessible is tuition 
free community college. This would allow students to begin 
their education without taking on a financial burden. This 
opportunity to begin to pursue the education needed to become a 
professional health care provider at a community college should 
not be underestimated.

    Additionally, state and Federal grants to reduce loan costs 
would make their career paths a more appealing option. Helping 
fund the education of minority students interested in becoming 
professional health care providers is a wise investment.

    It fills in demand jobs in the health care field and 
connects people with practical careers, which will allow them 
economic stability to support themselves and their families. 
Thank you again for the opportunity to testify and share my 
experience with you. I appreciate your consideration of my 
recommendations.

                 prepared statement of jaines andrades
    Chairman Sanders and Ranking Member, Dr. Cassidy, I am Jaines 
Andrades, a nurse practitioner at Baystate Medical Center in 
Springfield, Massachusetts. It is an honor to present my testimony 
before this Committee today. I thank you for the opportunity and your 
attention to addressing the shortage of minority health care 
professionals.

    I want to tell you a little bit about my experience and offer you 
some insight into ways I believe Congress could help increase the 
number of minority health care professionals in the future.

    Currently, I work as a nurse practitioner in the trauma and surgery 
unit at Baystate Medical Center. That is not exactly where my journey 
in health care began--but in some ways, it is close.

    I went to high school in Springfield, Massachusetts, at Putnam High 
School, an urban vocational high school that frequently failed to meet 
state standards. I was enrolled in the cosmetology program but had 
dreams of becoming a lawyer. As time passed, I struggled to figure out 
how to make that dream come true, coming from a single-parent home, 
where my mother didn't have the means to save for college or law 
school. I was fortunate, though, that she did have the drive to instill 
a strong work ethic and the foresight to encourage me to contemplate my 
talents and career which would offer economic stability. Not every kid 
has that behind them.

    One day, I was at a medical appointment with my mom, and a nurse 
started talking to me about the opportunities nursing offered. I was 
intrigued.

    To get a better sense of how I would fare on the path to becoming a 
nurse, I started taking courses at Holyoke Community College. I took 
prerequisites for programs to become a registered nurse, eventually 
enrolling at Elms College to earn my BSN.

    While I was going to school, I wanted to work to support myself, 
and thought taking a job at a hospital, to get my foot in the door and 
learn more about health care, would only benefit me in the long run.

    I began working in ``environmental services,'' as a custodian, at 
Baystate Medical Center. I worked to keep surgery and procedure rooms 
clean. This allowed me to see, first-hand, what nurses did, what I 
would need to know to move ahead in a health care environment, and to 
get advice on how to proceed in my career. My colleagues also offered 
incredible insight into ways I hadn't thought of to fund my education. 
They pointed me toward resources like the Western Mass Community 
Foundation, where I had access to scholarships and interest-free loans. 
Without my colleagues, I would not have been able to find such 
resources, which I believe were instrumental to my education. These 
resources need to be made more visible and accessible to students.

    I proceeded through nursing school and stayed at Baystate in 
environmental services for quite some time, waiting for a nursing 
opportunity. Eventually, I was hired as a nurse at one of our community 
health centers. There, again with the support of my colleagues, I was 
encouraged to earn my doctor of nursing practice degree.

    I did that at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was not 
easy. I eventually came ``full circle'' and took a job as a nurse 
practitioner in trauma and surgery back at Baystate Medical Center.

    Looking back on my own experience, if I could make suggestions to 
lawmakers on how to improve the shortage of minority health care 
providers, I would offer a few thoughts.

    First, I would say robust college and career planning is very 
critical. Making students at all schools, most especially those in 
lower-income areas, aware of health care as an attainable career 
opportunity would go far. Letting these students know it is within 
their reach and that there are resources available to them as they 
embark on the journey to higher education is key.

    At Baystate, we have a program called the Baystate Springfield 
Educational Partnership, or BSEP. This is a program for youth in 
Springfield, which helps connect them with hospital-based learning and 
opportunities to learn about different professions within the health 
care system. It allows students to engage with professionals, and learn 
from them, like I did working alongside them as a custodian, but while 
they are still in high school and evaluating their options. I did not 
go through this program myself, but I would recommend supporting 
similar opportunities for minority youth for early professional 
mentorship. There are a number of physicians, physician's assistants, 
and nurse practitioners who entered the program as high school students 
and now work for Baystate Health. Many of them also fill other roles in 
the Baystate system while advancing their education. I believe Federal 
support for programs like this could lead to many more minority 
students embarking on prosperous careers in health care.

    Another way to make this journey more accessible is tuition-free 
community college. This would allow students to begin their education 
without taking on a financial burden. The opportunity to begin to 
pursue the education needed to become a professional health care 
provider at a community college should not be underestimated.

    Additionally, state and Federal grants to reduce loan costs would

education of minority students interested in becoming professional 
health care providers is a wise investment; it fills in-demand jobs in 
the health care field and connects people with practical careers which 
will allow them economic stability to support themselves and their 
families.

    Thank you again for this opportunity to testify and share my 
experience and insight with you. I appreciate your consideration of my 
recommendations and thank you in advance for your questions.

    The Chair. Senator Cassidy, you want to introduce your last 
witness?

    Senator Cassidy. I will let my Senator from Alabama 
introduce the doctor from Alabama.

    Senator Tuberville. Thank you, Senator Cassidy. Welcome to 
all of you. It is my honor to introduce today Dr. Brian Stone 
of Jasper, Alabama.

    Dr. Stone grew up in Birmingham and received his undergrad 
degree from Rutgers. He went on to earn his medical degree from 
the University of Alabama, Birmingham. He was identified as a 
top urologist in New York and New Jersey, in his years of 
tenure at Columbia University's College of Physicians and 
Surgeons.

    He has received so many awards for his success, it is hard 
to count them all, but he has been honored by the NAACP, the 
Morehouse School of Medicine, the American Cancer Society, and 
the American Urology--Urological Association.

    Because of his leadership on issues like health disparities 
and prostate cancer, he has served in many capacities as a 
consultant and scientific advisor. He has served in advisory 
positions on the local, national, and international level over 
the years.

    He also worked in partnership with pastors and different 
denominations in Jefferson County, and the Jefferson County 
Department of Health to educate and recruit Black patients to 
participate in the clinical trials process.

    He serves on the Committee for Underrepresented Minorities 
at the University of Alabama, Birmingham School of Medicine, in 
conjunction with School of Medicine's National Alumni 
Association. He created a medical scholarship program for 
deserving male students of color from Alabama who have been 
accepted into the UAB School of Medicine.

    The goal is to increase the number of minority physicians 
who are from Alabama and are willing to practice medicine in 
the state. He has also worked to increase STEM exposure to K-12 
students in the city of Birmingham, in partnership with the 
Boys and Girls Club.

    Dr. Stone is currently the President and Chief Medical 
Staff of Walker Baptist Regional Medical Center, and the 
President of Jasper Urology Associates. I couldn't be more 
proud to have him here today, and we all look forward to his 
testimony. Thank you, Dr. Stone.

STATEMENT OF BRIAN STONE, M.D., FACS, PRESIDENT, JASPER UROLOGY 
                     ASSOCIATES, JASPER, AL

    Dr. Stone. There we go. Good morning. I would like to thank 
Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, Senator Tuberville, 
and Members of the HELP Committee for having me present to 
speak today.

    My background is a urologist. I think I am the old guy on 
this Committee. I graduated in 1985. I have had a breadth of 
experience working in the inner city, having trained in the 
Bronx, having worked at Harlem Hospital, which was connected to 
Columbia University. And I am now in a rural setting, and I see 
the similarities between the health problems that we see in the 
inner city as well as in rural America.

    When I think of America, I think of the saying that you 
can't choose your family, but you got to love them anyway. Our 
diverse people make our Country the greatest country in the 
world. But our greatness cannot be maintained if we can't keep 
our people healthy.

    Currently, we have about 71,000 physicians retiring per 
year over the past few years, and we are only graduating 21,000 
medical students per year. And if you follow the mathematics, 
you see where we are going to end up.

    We are going to need some very creative ideas to get us out 
of this situation. The impact of under--the low numbers of 
physicians has downstream impact on the number of specialists. 
And we feel that at our hospital now with our inability to 
recruit physicians in various specialties. An unhealthy nation 
is a less productive nation.

    Certain segments of American population are less healthy 
than others, as other speakers have spoken about. Black 
Americans have the highest death rate from all causes in our 
Country. These higher rates of disease and death have economic 
consequences, and that is why this is important for us to 
address.

    I grew up in a segregated Birmingham, where every Black, 
regardless of his socioeconomic status, lived in the same 
neighborhood. This had benefits because I had the opportunity 
to grow up with role models like Dr. James Montgomery, Dr. 
Clarence Hickson, Dr. Herschel Hamilton.

    My uncle, Dr. Warner Meadows was one of the first Black 
surgeons in Atlanta. These role models made me know that I 
could be whatever I wanted to be, but that is not the case for 
a lot of kids in America today.

    Unfortunately, technology has almost become an impediment 
to educating our children, and America appears to be at a major 
inflection point in how we educate our children, because this 
is the pool from which physicians are recruited.

    America and the Black community have a serious challenge in 
addressing the STEM gap that exists between white and Black 
students. Richard Coley and Barton noted that progress was 
being made in recruitment of African Americans to medical 
school, but this peaked in 1994.

    A 2018 Pew Research study showed that the poor foundation 
of STEM education in K-12 was the root cause of the recruitment 
problem for medical schools of medical students. There is a 
wealth of data showing better health outcomes when Black 
patients have Black physicians, and this applies across 
different cultures.

    This is because when you have cultural connectivity, you 
have better communication, you have shared experiences, and you 
can overcome the mistrust that has developed over the decades. 
Alabama has a population of 4.8 million people, 25.8 percent of 
whom are Black.

    Yet we only have 7 percent of the physician workforce that 
is Black. We are dealing with some serious health care issues 
in our state, particularly with limited access to health care 
in many of our rural areas. We have had closure of many of our 
rural hospitals and clinics, particularly in the Black belt of 
the state, and we got to come up with some real solutions.

    Most of our physicians tend to be concentrated in the major 
metropolitan areas of the state, leaving our rural areas at 
risk. It is no wonder that Alabama always ranks at the lowest 
as far as health amongst states in the area and it is--not only 
is the overall health of Alabamians comport--poor compared to 
residents of other states, but the health disparities between 
African Americans and Whites are very considerable.

    What are some of the potential solutions? Enhancing K-12 
STEM education. Incorporating mentors early. Creating a health 
focused fast track--to fast track students into medicine.

    Reducing the financial burden of medical education. 
Increasing the size of medical school classes. Increasing the 
size of residency training programs. The problem cannot be 
corrected overnight, but the crisis is real, and I think we 
need to start thinking out of the box. Thank you very much.

            Increasing Diversity in the Healthcare Workforce
    The U.S. will see a shortage of almost 139,000 physicians by 2032 
as the demand for physicians grow faster than the supply according to 
data published by the Association of American Medical Colleges. This 
physician deficit has many downstream affects and translates into 
shortages in both primary care and specialty care. Among specialists, 
the data project a shortage of up to 12,100 medical specialists, 23,400 
surgical specialists, 39,100 other specialists such as pathologists, 
neurologists, radiologists, and psychiatrists. 2032 is only 8 years 
away!

    America's strength is in its diverse population. Our grand 
experiment in democracy, which is a byproduct of the sacrifice and toil 
of religious refugees, slavery, immigrants, and native Americans has 
resulted in the most powerful country in the world. However, we are 
only as good as our health. An unhealthy nation is a less productive 
nation. Certain segments of the American population are much less 
healthy than others. Black American's have the highest mortality rate 
of all causes in the U.S. These high rates of disease and death have 
economic consequences. Increasing diversity in the healthcare workforce 
is one of the solutions in reducing the historic differences in health 
outcomes. The problems are complex, and the potential solutions 
complicated.
                               Background
    America and the black community have a serious challenge in 
addressing the STEMM (Science Technology Engineering Mathematics 
Medicine) education gap between white and Black students. Furthermore, 
African Americans represent 4 percent of U.S. physicians but 
approximately 14 percent of the population. This chasm widens further 
when you include the under representation of Hispanics who represent 
18.3 percent of the U.S. population and only 5 percent of the Nation's 
physicians. Richard Coley and Paul Barton note that progress was being 
made in recruitment of African Americans into medical school and peaked 
in 1994. However, there has been a precipitous decline in recruitment 
since that time creating a critical shortage in diversity in the 
physician workforce which adversely affects the care provided to 
underserved communities.

    According to 2023 data from the Association of American Medical 
Colleges, it is estimated that there are over 989,000 physicians in the 
U.S., but only approximately 46,000, were Black or African American. 
Forty-four percent of African American physicians are between the ages 
of 55 and 64 while another 35 percent are 65 or older. Among younger (< 
34 years old) African American physicians, the overwhelming majority 
(67 percent) are women, reflecting the dearth of young African American 
men entering the practice of medicine. The inequities in access to 
healthcare, participation in medical research, and current treatments 
can be mitigated by the presence of physicians that have been recruited 
from the communities that they treat. The COVID-19 pandemic has made 
evident the chasm between access to care in communities of color 
compared to white communities.

    Coley and Barton and multiple studies have consistently confirmed 
that Black and Hispanic physicians are ``significantly more likely to 
practice in underserved areas comprised largely of minority and poor 
populations''. The devastating, asymmetric impact of COVID-19 on 
communities of color and the racial inequities of the vaccine rollout 
highlighted the need for Black and Hispanic physicians. There is a 
wealth of data confirming better health outcomes in Black patients who 
have Black physicians. Dr. Karey Sutton, Ph.D. (Director of Health 
Equity Research; Medstar Health Research Institute) oversaw a 
systematic review of over 3000 studies on the impact of physician and 
patient race. The conclusion was that Black patients had better 
outcomes in the care of Black physicians because the care was better. 
Cultural connectivity is important, particularly in the context of 
historical mistrust. The negative impacts of outright racism (both 
individual and structural) on patient care like healthcare workers 
minimizing the pain of Black patients' complaints of pain and 
encounters of racism in emergency departments have been well 
documented. The bottom line is that racial concordance studies have 
illuminated the ways in which race affects how patients and doctors 
communicate and make decisions, regardless of either person's intent. 
Physicians and patients bring subconscious racial perceptions to their 
conversations. These problems can be mitigated by having a healthcare 
workforce that reflects the community that it serves.

    A 2018 Pew Research Center review described the poor foundation of 
STEMM education in K-12th grade as the root of the recruitment problem 
of Black students into medical school. The declining quality of public 
education, shrinking education budgets, loss of programs in the arts 
and music, greater emphasis on athletics and the increasing societal 
distractions (electronic gaming, social media, cell phones, etc.) have 
made educating our youth much more challenging. The shift to virtual 
learning due to the pandemic has had an additionally devastating impact 
on learning, particularly among African American males. A U.S. 
Department of Education's study of students beginning college as early 
as 1989 -1990 found that African American men were less likely to major 
in science than white males and females or African American women. Only 
2.6 percent of African American males were science majors in their 
first year of college, representing only 1/3 of the proportion of 1st-
year white males majoring in science during the same year. Coley and 
Barton concluded that this alarming trend supports the observation that 
African American men are steering away from majoring in science, 
leaving only a small pool of African American male science majors for 
medical schools (and STEMM entities) to recruit from. African American 
women, while performing better than the males, are being negatively 
impacted as well. I would dare say that at the current rate of decline 
in the recruitment of Blacks into medicine that there may come a day 
that Black physicians are rarely seen, especially Black men!

    The impact of structural and systemic racism continues to hinder 
entry of Black students into STEMM career fields in 2021. In 2019, we 
saw the lowest representation of African Americans in the incoming 
medical school classes of the country's medical schools since 1978! 
Even more alarming is the fact that most Blacks entering graduate 
medical education programs are female. This trend of declining Black 
male representation in medical school began in 1988-89 when the 
percentage of Black female medical school graduates became the majority 
at 51-52 percent. In 2018, Q. M. Capers and L. Clinchot concluded that 
Black gender disparity rapidly accelerated to 35 percent male versus 65 
percent female medical school graduates in 2015.
                     Health Disparities in Alabama
    My home state of Alabama has a population of 4,833,722 and is faced 
with some serious healthcare challenges, particularly with limited 
access to healthcare in many of its rural areas. Many of our small 
rural hospitals have closed. The ``Black Belt'' of the state, with some 
of its poorest areas, has suffered the most. We are experiencing 
significant healthcare workforce shortages.

    The ``Alabama Health Disparities Status Report 2010'' confirmed the 
startling tragedy of minority healthcare in Alabama, which consistently 
ranks as one of the least healthy states (46th out of 50) in the 
Nation. Similarly, Alabama ranks 37th in health care access, 39th in 
health care quality and 47th in public health. Not only is the overall 
health of Alabamians poor compared to that of residents of other 
states, but health disparities between African Americans and Whites are 
considerable. African Americans comprise approximately 82.75 percent of 
the non-white population in Alabama. These health disparities in both 
access to care and the delivery of care to minorities in the state. 
African Americans in Alabama had higher rates of all chronic diseases, 
injury, premature death and disability. The consequences of these 
disparities include shorter life expectancy, diminished quality of 
life, loss of economic opportunities and socioeconomic inequality.

    There are significant racial disparities in cardiovascular disease, 
diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, cancer, infant mortality, chronic 
lung diseases, stroke, and complications (and severity) of the COVID-19 
infection. It is a moral imperative that we actively seek to increase 
the numbers of physician healthcare providers in the State of Alabama 
and ensure that there is appropriate representation of African American 
physicians. Studies have shown that Black patients are more likely to 
feel comfortable with physicians with a similar cultural framework and 
more likely to adhere to preventative medical recommendations offered 
by Black physicians. Cultural competency is the key to improving 
patient compliance and trust. The COVID-19 vaccine rollout has 
confirmed that the Black community continues to distrust majority 
health institutions, reflected in the ``PTSD'' of the ``Tuskegee 
Experiment'' and the legacy of physicians like James Marion Sims (the 
``father of modern gynecology'') who performed unethical surgical 
procedures on enslaved Black women. In addition to these landmark 
research abuses, there is both a long legacy and, in some settings, an 
ongoing pattern of racial bias experienced by African Americans seeking 
care. It is for these reasons that we must provide early introduction 
to STEMM education, mentor, prepare and recruit more African American 
students into medicine. The presence of diversity in medicine enhances 
African American (Hispanic, Asian, and Native American) cultural 
competency by increasing empathy and cultural sensitivity in the entire 
medical community.
                         The Lack of a Pipeline
    Coley and Barton write that a college graduate's educational 
choices directly affect the size of the pool of candidates available to 
apply to medical school. This talent pool is deeply deficient in the 
U.S. and even more so in Alabama. Multiple factors, early in the lives 
of young Alabamians, hinder growth of the pool of qualified students 
applying to STEMM graduate programs. The ``molding'' of talent starts 
at the birth of the child and extends to care provided in early 
formative years. This process continues through the K-12 education 
system as the students potentially lack rigorous academic curricula and 
subsequently don't graduate from high school or attend college. Even 
among those Alabamians who do attend college, many, lacking early 
stimulation of their interests in science and math, do not choose a 
STEMM major or even succeed in graduating.

    Multiple sources including Parker and Funk as well as Shamard 
Charles recognize that the overwhelming challenge is to enhance the 
educational process, introduce the students at an early educational age 
to STEMM, ``steer'' their education choices toward STEMM and reduce the 
attrition rate. Enlarging the pool of qualified African American 
students who realistically have a choice of a higher education pathway 
to medicine requires increasing their academic proficiency during the 
period from middle school to high school. The success of increasing the 
pool of academically qualified Black students from Alabama for 
acceptance into the medical school requires a dual approach of 
developing and exposing students early in their academic journey to a 
STEMM curriculum and exposing them to Black STEMM role models. 
Controlling the attrition rate will require reinforcing this exposure 
through continuous contact with Black STEMM mentors. The more ``African 
American success'' they see, the more confidence they will have that 
they too can ``succeed'' in STEMM. The goal should not be to lower 
academic standards but to enhance student education and preparation.
               Economic Impediments to Medical Education
    It is no secret that there is a significant economic gap between 
white communities and communities of color in the U.S. Many aspiring 
students and their families struggle just to provide financial support 
for a college education. The cost of collegiate and graduate education 
has increased significantly over the years which represents a greater 
barrier to entry for students of color. Graduate school can be a 
financial ``Mount Everest'' for most qualified students of color. On 
average medical school tuition, fees, and health insurance during the 
2019-2020 academic year ranged from $37,556 (in-state, public) to 
$62,194 (out of state, public). Additionally, among persons entering 
medical school in 2018, African Americans were more likely than other 
racial and ethnic subgroups to owe > $50K dollars even before 
accumulating any additional medical school debt. It is imperative that 
financial support be readily available to those students who 
successfully navigate the academic rigors of a collegiate pre-medical 
program and are accepted into a medical school program.
                        What Are the Solutions?
    The ideal goal should be to create a healthcare workforce that is 
representative of the population that it serves (preferably staffed by 
members from that community). This means setting recruitment goals 
based on the ethnic make-up of the state or community.

    K-12 STEMM Education--Building the talent pool of kids interested 
in undergraduate education in the sciences and ultimately pre-medical 
education.

    Completely Changing the K-12 Education Paradigm--Moving away from 
the educational structure of the past and shortening the pathway into 
medicine. Developing health academies in high schools in partnership 
with a state's undergraduate universities and medical schools creating 
curriculums that ``fast track'' qualified students into medical 
careers.

    Reducing the Financial Burden--The cost of an average 4-year 
undergraduate education at a public institution is approximately 
$120,000 (out-of-state $180,000). Combine that with the average medical 
school cost of $300--400,000 and a student pursuing a career in 
medicine is looking at shouldering over $500,000 in debt! This is 
outlandish and has a negative impact on diversity in the healthcare 
workforce.

    Increasing Medical School Class Sizes--U.S. medical schools 
graduated 28,700 students in 2022. The training of new doctors must 
keep tract with the physician retirement rate. The challenge facing our 
Nation is the substantial number of ``baby boomer'' physicians, like 
me, who will be leaving the workforce in the coming 5-10 years that 
will create the projected shortfall of 139,000 physicians by 2033!

    Increasing the Number of Residency Training Positions--As medical 
school enrollment is increased the concern is the lack of residency 
programs and clinical training sites for the graduates. According to an 
AAMC annual survey, the number of residency training positions has not 
kept pace with the increasing number of medical students. This dilemma 
threatens to exacerbate the Nation's physician shortage.
                              Conclusions
    (1). Our country has faced daunting challenges before. This is not 
a Democrat or Republican problem; it is an American problem.

    (2). Heart disease, diabetes and cancer don't care about political 
party affiliation or race. The health of ``all'' of our population must 
be our No. 1 priority. Our people are our greatest strength and our 
treasure and should be treated as such.

    (3). Assembly of talented people who have different experiences and 
perspectives empowers the necessary cultural translation when people 
need assistance facing challenges that have the complexity and intimacy 
of healthcare.

    (4). Diversity improves cultural competence for the collective body 
of the healthcare workforce. Better cultural competence facilitates 
better engagement with patients which leads to better understanding, 
better shared decision-making, better compliance with treatment plans, 
and, ultimately, to improved patient outcomes.

    (5). Furthermore, as we consider the wholistic approach of 
improving the health of the population, cultural differences not only 
affect engagement with people who have clinical needs but also 
influences how different peoples ingest information to consider 
participation in clinical research.

    (6). A healthcare workforce that reflects the heterogeneous 
population of the U.S. increases patient ``trust'' which is necessary 
to achieve greater participation in clinical research and achieve 
better clinical outcomes to improve the health of the entire U.S. 
population. To optimize effectiveness for healthcare outcomes we must 
confront the reality that communication and trust are essential to be 
most effective, as we focus on the opportunity to help those who need 
the most help.
                                 ______
                                 

    The Chair. Well, let me thank all of the panelists. Every 
one of you made extremely important issues, and I hope very 
much that this Committee will act on some of your thoughts. Let 
me start with, and I must confess that until fairly recently, I 
did not appreciate this issue.

    Until a couple of years ago, we had some, young people from 
Howard University coming into the office, and they were chiming 
in. And one young one was saying, talking about the experience 
her mom had of going to a physician's office and not being 
taken seriously and so forth. And I know all of you in various 
ways have raised the issue.

    Let me ask, I think many Americans would say, hey, this as 
a physician, what difference does it make white, Black, Latino, 
who cares, as long as they are a good doctor. What difference 
does it make for having--going to a physician who kind of 
understands your life maybe comes from your community. What 
difference does it make? Dr. Lawson, you want to start? We will 
go right down the line.

    Dr. Lawson. Absolutely. It makes a huge difference. Me, 
myself, in practice, many times the trust, when I build trust, 
my patients really do respect and comply with therapy.

    It is not uncommon for me to experience many of my patients 
may go to, a physician of a different race or ethnicity and 
question, right, the treatments that they are prescribed or 
have given me or provided personal experiences where they 
weren't respected within the system, or they were provided 
treatments that were inadequate or substandard, or not even 
given options--especially being an OB-GYN.

    I don't have to tell you that historically, so many women, 
Black women and Latino women, underwent hysterectomies 
unnecessarily. The options of childbirth were taken away from 
them. And so, these are everyday experiences.

    The Chair. Thank you very much. Please be brief. I want to 
hear from everybody. Dr. Cook.

    Dr. Cook. Yes, sir. Thank you so much, Chairman Sanders. It 
is really an issue of cultural competence. You don't understand 
the perspectives and the concerns of people from other races as 
well as they do for themselves.

    We grow up in similar situations. We know very similar 
circumstances that happen to all of our families. And, as Dr. 
Lawson alluded to, there is an inherent mistrust. We saw that 
even with COVID vaccinations and the inability to get Black 
Americans to even take those vaccinations. So it is a 
widespread problem, and it will only improve with more 
representation.

    The Chair. Thank you very much. Dr. Galvez--the microphone, 
yes.

    Dr. Galvez. Thank you. For the Latino population the 
patient physician concordance is so important to have that 
cultural competency, to decrease miscommunication. And the 
language component for Latinos in particular is very important 
because things can get lost in translation.

    A story I can think of is a patient comes in, their child 
needs a surgery, has a congenital hand difference, and 
everything gets discussed in the visit, but the family is more 
worried about general anesthesia.

    That question doesn't get asked or doesn't get fully 
addressed. And so, they leave the visit. They maybe booked the 
surgery because someone said just, we are ready to do the 
surgery. You got to fix this problem.

    They book the surgery but then the patient just cancels 
because they are so concerned, and they didn't get their 
questions answered. And so that miscommunication results in 
delays in care.

    The Chair. Dr. Andrades.

    Ms. Andrades. I think for patients, especially in my field 
of trauma surgery, I meet patients on their worst day. I am of 
Puerto Rican descent, so in being able to speak to someone who 
just went through a terrible car accident or some trauma, I 
think gives them a breath of fresh air.

    Again, as the other panelists have alluded to, it is the 
trust that you have someone that speaks your language and looks 
like you at the forefront of your medical care. And I think 
that really makes a difference in patient satisfaction and 
patients trusting the health care system.

    The Chair. Thank you. Dr. Stone.

    Dr. Stone. I deal with it daily when it comes to, say, 
prostate cancer, the difference between a Black male and how he 
communicates than a white male. The concerns they may have, the 
trust factor. All of that plays into the relationship and 
patient compliance.

    The Chair. My last question, briefly. I am running out of 
time now. Dr. Cook mentioned that he graduated medical school 
for $400,000, and that I have talked to doctors who graduated 
with more debt. Nurses, graduating with a lot of debt.

    Generally speaking, Black, Latino, Native American 
communities are poorer than White communities. What does the 
financial constrictions mean to young people in minority 
communities who want to pursue a career in medicine? Dr. 
Lawson, briefly.

    Dr. Lawson. Absolutely. The financial implications can 
almost make it impossible to pursue the degree or be very 
discouraging to individuals.

    I myself am working on scholarships for students, but I 
encourage anything that we can do. I myself participated in 
many disadvantaged programs to fund my medical education. But, 
I was told that I couldn't do it literally because my family 
did not have the resources.

    The Chair. If people could go to medical school without 
having to worry about tuition or student debt, would that make 
a difference in your communities, Dr. Cook?

    Dr. Cook. Of course. The price tag in itself is a barrier. 
Think for 1 second if you took out $400,000 in debt and you got 
sick in your first year of residency, you will have no way to 
repay that. You will be forever in debt.

    The Chair. Dr. Galvez.

    Dr. Galvez. Those socioeconomic differences make a big 
difference. And the difference for Latinos in particular is the 
need to work. And so, when you have to take on all this debt, 
it really is something you are deciding for your family.

    The other difference that happens frequently is you have a 
student who has to work and do classes at the same time, and 
pay for tuition, versus a student who is in a more affluent 
community and has an office space to study and dedicated time. 
That is where these disparities begin.

    The Chair. Dr. Andrades.

    Ms. Andrades. It gives students a chance to be able to even 
start to feel that a health care career is in their realm of 
possibilities because, finances and the financial burden, as 
again the other panelists have alluded to, really is a huge 
deterrent for minority students.

    The Chair. Dr. Stone.

    Dr. Stone. I mentor a lot of kids that are bright and could 
be physicians, but they are deterred by the cost. So, if there 
was a way to offset the costs, we could increase the numbers.

    The Chair. Good. All right. Thank you, panelists.

    Senator Cassidy.

    Senator Cassidy. I thank you all. Dr. Stone, my wife is a 
1983 graduate of UAB.

    Dr. Stone. Okay.

    Senator Cassidy. I kind of hide that fact in Louisiana, but 
that is okay. And I will note, Dr. Galvez, you don't respect 
our Spanish. If you are interpreting, this is--I am telling you 
why you should do it.

    [Laughter.]

    Senator Cassidy. Thank you all. Dr. Stone, African 
Americans have a, as we both know, as you particularly know, 
much higher incidence of prostate cancer. And there is a 
certain kind of, I don't know, cultural kind of reticence to 
have it address sometimes. I am a gastroenterologist.

    Dr. Stone. Yes.

    Senator Cassidy. Same sort of thing. And I see that you 
have partnered with communities of faith by which to, I assume, 
allay concern and spread the word. So, will you comment on 
that?

    Dr. Stone. Yes. One of my particular concerns has been the 
lack of inclusion in clinical trials and the fact that most 
therapeutics, as matter of fact, all therapeutics that are 
developed in the U.S. are developed based on data from white 
patients.

    The Human Genome Project has shown that the way drugs are 
metabolized is different between cultural groups. So, I am 
concerned that the dosing, when doses are established and the 
FDA approves it, that it may not be appropriate for different 
cultural groups.

    I am trying to increase participation in clinical trials by 
engaging the faith-based community, through which we can 
recruit and try to get more patients to participate, because 
the trust bridge is already established in the church.

    Senator Cassidy. I am totally with you on that. I used to 
do clinical research and treated a lot of hepatitis, and my 
population was 60 percent African American. I ended up being 
the lead recruiter for African Americans because I had worked 
for two decades in the hospital and there was a trust there.

    Dr. Stone. Yes.

    Senator Cassidy. The first time they were invited in was 
not to participate in a trial. The first time they were invited 
in was to see me. And then I saw them for 10 years before 
speaking about a trial.

    Dr. Stone. Absolutely.

    Senator Cassidy. I congratulate you on that because as we 
both know it can bring great benefit.

    Dr. Stone. Thank you.

    Senator Cassidy. To the individual and to the patient. So, 
Dr. Andrades--for some reason my Rs are not rolling today. I am 
so impressed with how you were kind of what is the word, 
inspired to pursue health care, and move from cosmetology into 
doing that environmental services work, etcetera. How do we 
light that same flame in others?

    Ms. Andrades. I think as I said in my testimony, I think, 
again, it is making the financial burden on students of 
minority less.

    Senator Cassidy. Yes, but I am not speaking about--it has 
to first have that spark of interest. And the next is, how do 
you reduce the barrier. But the first is a spark of interest. 
So how do you spark that interest?

    Ms. Andrades. I think sitting here today is one way to 
spark that interest so that other minority students can see 
that this is a reasonable idea for them, and they can see 
someone that looks like them in a space where typically you 
don't see minorities.

    Senator Cassidy. I accept that because people see a role 
model. My daughter is an air traffic controller, whatever, 
because she saw a YouTube of a female air traffic controller. 
So that makes sense to me that you would do that. And then what 
inspired you to continue to upskill, if you will, to become 
that nurse practitioner?

    Because it is obviously what--I went to med-tech, and she 
had already taken all the pre-med courses. She was med tech, 
and then she advanced her skills and became an MD. So just to 
point that out, that works, right? So, your thoughts on that.

    Ms. Andrades. I was inspired to continue my education to 
become a nurse practitioner by actually an African American 
nurse, Gloria Wilson, who worked with me at Mason Square. She 
was in her 60's at the time, and she was going to school for 
her master's degree.

    She kept kind of saying, but you can do it. Like, you can 
do it. And I just said, Okay, well, I will apply. If I get in, 
then I will continue my education. So, my inspiration to 
continue was this African American nurse who is in her 60's and 
still searching and looking for opportunities for her own 
education.

    Senator Cassidy. A role model and a mentor.

    Ms. Andrades. Again, a role model, yes.

    Senator Cassidy. Dr. Galvez, you had mentioned increasing 
the Latino workforce by having some sort of Federal funding tie 
that would require someone to have a second language in order 
to advance.

    But frankly, that would discriminate against like African 
Americans or against others who might--a Native American who 
may not have a second language. And so, square that circle for 
me. It seems like we are creating another barrier to require a 
second language.

    Dr. Galvez. It is a great question and thank you so much 
for it. It really is, as I mentioned as well in my testimony, 
language has frequently been ignored.

    Yes, it is challenging. I didn't want to--like my parents 
forced me to speak Spanish at home. That is how I learned it. 
And yes, I am privileged that I was able to learn it at home 
and very grateful because it is my superpower, like I 
mentioned.

    But it is something that I believe should be encouraged, 
especially if you have a medical school that, for example, in 
California, by 2050 it is going to be almost 50 percent Latino.

    Those considerations of language will improve efficiency in 
your clinic, right. If you have a 15 minute visit----

    Senator Cassidy. I accept that. We are almost out of time--
we are.

    Dr. Galvez. Oh, sorry. Yes.

    Senator Cassidy. But maybe as a question for the record, we 
have to see we don't create other barriers for a future Dr. 
Cook.

    Dr. Galvez. Yes.

    Senator Cassidy. Let me just finish by saying this. As a 
physician, I thank you all for still seeing patients. So, thank 
you. I yield.

    The Chair. Senator Casey.

    Senator Casey. Let me start by thanking you, Mr. Chairman, 
and the Ranking Member, for having a hearing on this range of 
critically important issues, whether it is the diversity of the 
workforce or whether it is health disparities or maternal 
health or maternal mortality.

    I believe that in order to nurture a future generation of 
Black and Brown health care workers, or in order to close gaps 
between outcomes for white and Black mothers, we have to start 
in childhood.

    That means that the Congress of the United States has to 
get into the game in a way that we haven't ever really. I 
believe it comes down to at least five basic freedoms that 
every child should have a right to enjoy, and we should invest 
in those freedoms, not just talk about them like their 
platitudes.

    The freedom to be healthy, the freedom to learn, the 
freedom to have economic security, which means giving children 
the opportunity--their families, the opportunity to save at a 
very young age for their future.

    The fourth freedom would be the freedom from hunger. And 
the fifth freedom would be the freedom to be safe from harm. 
Every child has those five, health, the opportunity to learn, 
economic security, freedom from hunger, and to be safe. We will 
have a much different outcome on all these issues we are here 
to talk about. But the Federal Government hasn't done that.

    I think it requires a maximum commitment to our children. I 
will start with Dr. Lawson, you had talked about the improved 
outcomes patients have when they are able to see health care 
providers that look like them, a very important point to make 
in this hearing and beyond.

    In the context of maternity care, what has your experience 
been with both midwives and doulas, and what role can they play 
in reducing health disparities?

    Dr. Lawson. Absolutely. Thank you, Senator. I have had a 22 
year history with experience in OB-GYN. My entire career I have 
worked with midwives and doulas. I even owned a birth center 
myself and employed midwives. Very impactful.

    No. 1, I believe women should have a choice with what type 
of provider they want, and that is what midwives can do. I 
think that doulas are an excellent support for women. They were 
an extension of me.

    I could send the doula to the house, help a woman in early 
labor, postpartum checks, mood disorders. Sometimes they would 
share things with the doula they may not want to share with me. 
So very important aspect and add on support for women during 
pregnancy and childbirth.

    Senator Casey. Well, thank you. We are all trying to do 
more to invest in programs that would support doulas and 
midwives. Dr. Galvez, you mentioned the role of community 
colleges in helping to develop the pipeline of health care 
workers and for diversifying the workforce. Community colleges 
are the most diverse sector of higher education.

    I know that just from representing Pennsylvania. We have 
got 15 community colleges, and I am amazed at the 
sophistication of the curriculum and how well-prepared young 
people are coming out of those community colleges. How can we 
better use the opportunities that community colleges offer to 
help grow and diversify the health care workforce?

    Dr. Galvez. It really was, at least for me--I didn't know 
how to study. I did poorly in high school. It wasn't until 
community college that I learned how to study, and I learned 
those skills--I used those skills at Stanford for medical 
school, the same study skills.

    I do think, as I mentioned, I think it is an untapped 
resource. I think recruiting early and encouraging students to 
consider a career in medicine and other health care fields is a 
good source, just like you said. It is a very diverse pool.

    Better use them and include them. It is to create pathway 
programs where we have--in California, we have the California 
Medical Scholars Program, which is in development, where they 
are linking community college.

    But it really is--it is providing mentorship and guiding 
them, but it is not guaranteed acceptance. And that is where I 
think taking it a step further and guaranteeing these students, 
and creating even a quota for medical schools so that they can 
better reflect their community is a strategy for this--for 
diversifying the workforce.

    Senator Casey. Doctor, thanks very much. And before I 
conclude, I want to commend Dr. Cook for your telling your 
story here today. The fact that you attended Drexel helps in my 
estimation. But it is a great American story and I know you 
worked hard to achieve it. So, thanks for being here today and 
providing that testimony. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.

    The Chair. Thank you. Senator Marshall.

    Senator Marshall. All right. Thank you, Chairman. This is 
obviously an issue very near and dear to my heart. It is an 
issue that I have dedicated my life to solving. And before I go 
on with my remarks, I want to make sure everybody knows that 
one maternal death is too many.

    Yes, we need more minority doctors, nurses, the whole 
gamut, Okay. I totally acknowledge that. Mr. Chairman, I would 
suggest that the work we have done with community health 
centers will do more to impact this than all the other ideas we 
are hearing about.

    That our vision of these community health centers would 
have prenatal clinics in them and then help take care of the 
woman after the baby is delivered, something as an obstetrician 
that maybe I didn't do the best job after we got to about 6 
weeks.

    The other thing that would impact this more is stopping the 
illegal crossings on our border and the fentanyl poisoning that 
is just--it is accumulating problems for my moms as well. My 
story--I think you have to hear my story. And I am sorry, but I 
am a first generation college student too.

    I went to a community college. My wife went to a community 
college, a community college nurse. 90 percent of nurses in our 
hospital are community college nurses. Went to a residency 
program in Saint Pete, Tampa. Very busy.

    Eight residents, 5,000 deliveries a year. So, in 20,000 
moms that we delivered, do you know how many maternal deaths we 
had? Zero. And how so? The answer is how come? Two things. One, 
we had incredible committed doctors and nurses and ultrasound 
techs. But No. 2 is I set up a prenatal clinic.

    When I got there, a fourth, maybe half of our moms were not 
getting any prenatal care. I went to a church on the wrong side 
of town, and said, we will use your basement to set up a 
prenatal clinic and made sure that every mom had prenatal care 
before they ever got to the hospital.

    That probably, how many lives that saved. But that was one 
simple solution. And then in my private practice, half of my 
moms, we delivered--I delivered over 5,000 babies personally, 
and half of my moms drove more than 60 miles to see me. By the 
way, the only thing worse than no prenatal care is bad prenatal 
care.

    It scares me to death when people think that they should be 
delivering babies in facilities that have one delivery a week 
or one a month. That is a scary situation as well. But again, 
zero deaths. Why? Because--and I am going to--half the babies 
we delivered in residency were minority.

    Half the babies we delivered in my private practice were 
minorities, half of which were on Medicaid or had no money. So, 
it wasn't like it was this perfect group of people that had 
everything in life. Half of my patients spoke Spanish that I 
delivered.

    Those were challenges, but no deaths is because we gave 
prenatal care and I was obsessed with prenatal care, and my 
nurses were obsessed with giving good prenatal care.

    Ask the panel, how many women died in 2023, maternal deaths 
were there in 2023? Does anybody know the answer to that? Okay, 
it was 684. In 2021, it was 1,205. So, we dropped from 1,200 to 
684.

    First of all, I want to thank all the hard working nurses 
and doctors and the people out there, community health centers 
that are making a difference. Next, what is the most common 
cause of maternal death now? Does anyone in the panel know 
that? Go ahead.

    Dr. Lawson. In Black women, cardiovascular disease. In 
Native American men and women, and in Caucasian women, we 
sometimes see mental health and substance use disorders.

    Senator Marshall. Yes. I wish that was the case, but the 
most common cause of maternal death now is suicide and drug 
overdosing and fentanyl poisoning, Okay. That is the No. 1 
cause. What percentage of these deaths occur more than a week 
after delivery?

    Dr. Lawson. Over half--around 52 percent.

    Senator Marshall. Yes, 52, 53 percent. So, half of these 
deaths are occurring after--a week after delivery. It is why 
these community health centers are so important, is to follow-
up on the mental health aspect, let alone the addiction issues 
as well, Okay.

    That is the solution to the postpartum issues. Inter-
partum, No. 1 cause is now hemorrhage, heart disease, stroke 
PE, cardiomyopathy infection, and hypertension. Those are the 
ones that we can impact with prenatal care and intra-partum 
care as well.

    I think we have to also acknowledge why is heart disease 
spiking right now from a maternal M and M situation as well? 
Well, it is several reasons. One is our moms are older.

    No. 2 is they are heavier. And No. 3 is diabetes. I mean, 
the amount of diabetics, type 2 diabetics that I saw in my 
clinic doubled or tripled over my 25 year career. So again, we 
go back to our community health centers with nutrition as a 
component, with mental health as a component, that we hopefully 
have healthier moms before they get pregnant. That is what is 
going to impact all these.

    We don't need to form committees and pray about it. We know 
the solutions. I think our community health center is the best 
thing I see out there that is going to touch all people, and 
just look forward to continue the great work the Chairman and 
Ranking Member have done in these issues.

    Thank you so much. I yield back.

    The Chair. Let me just inject. What Senator Marshall was 
talking about is fairly comprehensive legislation that left 
this Committee. And Senator Marshall and Senator Braun, among 
others, Senator Murkowski played an important role in that. And 
I hope we can get that legislation moving again.

    Senator Kaine.

    Senator Kaine. Thank you, Chair Sanders. And thanks to the 
panel. What a great panel. So, you all in your professional 
lives have some pinnacle days that really make it worth doing. 
And I just wanted to reflect as I think about the work we do 
here, we may not have as many as you, but we have some.

    Three times in the 11 years I have been here, we passed 
meaningful legislation or taken meaningful action on the floor 
of the Senate by one vote. And on those days, it makes me 
think, wow, what if I hadn't run.

    In August 2017, we saved the Affordable Care Act in the 
U.S. Senate by one vote, and 30 million people did not lose 
health insurance, and tens of millions of people did not lose 
the ability to be protected against discrimination because they 
had a preexisting condition.

    In 2022, we passed the Inflation Reduction Act by one vote, 
capping prescription drug prices, out-of-pocket costs, 
negotiating for prescription drugs under Medicare passed it by 
one vote. The third one voter is not generally thought of as a 
health bill. It is the American Rescue Plan in March 2021.

    But it had within it something really important. Prior to 
the American Rescue Plan, Medicaid would cover a mom after 
birth for 60 days. In the American Rescue Plan and then 
subsequently in appropriations bills, we extended that option.

    States could choose that a mom would be covered post-
delivery for a year by Medicaid. It is interesting it was a 
state option, but it was enormously popular. 46 states have 
embraced this option, 3 are in the process of embracing it, and 
only 1 has not pursued it.

    What is this likely to mean playing out over time that 
Medicaid will now cover moms, not just the kids, but will cover 
moms for a year after delivery? Please, Dr. Lawson.

    Dr. Lawson. Sir, thank you. Thank you for that comment and 
I appreciate your work. The one state that has not adopted 
legislation is Arkansas and that is originally where I am from, 
where over 50 percent of moms here are on Medicaid that 
deliver.

    This has huge impacts. And I extend to you that it is 
beyond even maternal care. When you look at the five top causes 
of infant mortality in this country, two of those five are due 
to either maternal complications or low birth weight babies, 
really due to preterm birth. So, you are talking about lifelong 
impact, because we know that infant health also is an important 
marker of the overall health of society.

    When you talk about how impactful this is, major impactful. 
Again, I am in Texas. We are excited. I remember and certain my 
colleagues that have done OB-GYN as a rotation, even as a 
student, know that we would try to compact all of a woman's 
health care in those 6 weeks where she had Medicaid coverage. 
So, we thank you for the work that you all have done for this.

    Senator Kaine. Yes, the ability not to have to cram it into 
6 weeks, but to have it for a year. I mean, it is--I think we 
will start seeing statistics and I would suspect the statistics 
because of who Medicaid covers, are not just likely to be a 
reduction in maternal mortality, but it should start to eat 
away at some of the disparities that we are seeing in maternal 
mortality.

    I am really interested in following this. It is still 
relatively recently implemented. I think Virginia might have 
been the first state that embraced it. We happen to have a 
doctor as Governor when this got passed, the American Rescue 
Plan, so he was fast out of the starting gate.

    But the fact that now every state has either done it or in 
the process of doing it save one. We seldom do things that are 
so popular here where states say we want to be part of this, 
and I am excited that we are.

    I want to just--my colleague, Senator Casey, asked the 
question about community colleges, and I don't need to go into 
it as much. But I mean, it is interesting to note that of our 
five panel, I think both Dr. Galvez and Dr. Andrades were 
community--began in community college, and it is really 
important.

    Community college students--just who is a community college 
student? The average community college student is older than 
25, receives a Pell Grant, attends part time, and is a woman. 
And is more likely than the population norm to be a person of 
color. That is our community college population.

    Many fantastic health care professionals start there, and 
we just need to do more really to recognize our community 
colleges as great beginning places, accelerators, on ramps, 
right, on ramps to success in many ways, but including in 
health care professions. And so, I think it is just 
interesting.

    In the randomness of who are our five witnesses. We have 
two who began in community college, and I appreciate that. The 
last thing I will say, it is not really a question, but we have 
to get a hold of it.

    We have been using a set of maternal mortality statistics 
to compare to other nations and also to look at disparities. 
And there has been some recent churn about whether the 
statistics that we have been using are accurate.

    I am kind of a data geek, and I really hope that we can 
work together with the CDC to arrest any confusion about the 
statistics. I think measured accurately, we are still going to 
find we are an outlier with other nations, and we are still 
going to find these significant disparities.

    But to the extent there has been a little bit of 
controversy about them, I think--I hope we can work together to 
improve the data and how we report it. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

    The Chair. Senator Braun.

    Senator Braun. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In my home State of 
Indiana, we have the third highest maternal mortality rate at 
44 deaths per 100,000 births in 2022. That is sad. Regarding 
this sad state of affairs, local news article said that nothing 
has changed in 10 years. That needs to change.

    That lack of improvement is disappointing state by state. 
That is why I have been vocal on health care in general here. 
And we did pass out of this Committee the Preemie Act 
reauthorization, which renews resources for HHS to promote 
healthy pregnancies.

    The Improving Access to Maternal Health for Military and 
Dependent Moms Act, that is being reviewed. Hopefully we get 
that through this Committee. And the Standing with Moms Act, 
which would increase the availability of pregnancy related 
resources to expectant mothers. Another bill.

    We are drawing attention to it. My question is for Dr. 
Lawson, in your home State of Texas, what have you seen there? 
Have they been improving? There is a lot more agility at the 
state level to address things. Tell me what has been happening 
there.

    Dr. Lawson. Thank you for the question. So, over the--up 
until 2021, we have not improved. Some new data--I know that 
our MMRC is working on the biennial report. We will hopefully 
have that this summer to see where we are for 2022 and thus 
far.

    But overall, Texas has one of the worst rates of maternal 
morbidity and mortality. We are very excited that the 
postpartum Medicaid extension was made, but of course, we are a 
state that does not have Medicaid expansion.

    What we are also concerned about from a workforce 
perspective is some--having enough physicians, right, for the 
population and enough physicians that actually take Medicaid 
coverage for those populations.

    We have some strong county hospital networks there. But of 
course, we have not seen the reduction in numbers that we would 
like to see ideally.

    Senator Braun. Have any states, from your observation, 
found best practices that are doing a good job? Do you keep 
track of that? Because you think among the 50, that someone 
would actually be doing a decent job with it. Have you noticed 
anything to that effect?

    Dr. Lawson. There are some states that I think--I can point 
to California, the California Perinatal Quality Collaborative. 
They are doing some really great work. And especially when you 
think about that population.

    Also, New York is doing some really great work. I think, 
again, in collaboration with the MMRCs, the data piece is very 
important. That drives a lot of policy from a public health 
perspective and for hospital quality improvement projects.

    Senator Braun. This is such an important area, along with 
getting more doctors and professionals paying attention to it, 
especially among minorities as well. We should be throwing 
everything in the kitchen sink at this, both federally and by 
state.

    I want to segue to one other issue that I bring up always, 
is the broken nature of our health care system that is 
increasingly being run by large corporate entities that I don't 
know that have any interest in prevention and wellness--mostly 
in expensive remediation.

    Until we get that fixed, we are going to keep, I think, 
avoiding what we all know makes more sense, prevention and 
wellness. And that is going to take a cultural change within 
health care itself.

    Probably the biggest thing would be how do you lower costs 
among insurance companies and hospitals? I can tell you what 
has been happening has been the opposite. It has alienated even 
a lot of physicians and nurses from getting into the business, 
because their dream wasn't to be working for huge corporations 
that don't have practitioners in mind and the patient.

    That has got to change in terms of what we can do state by 
state, and here as well. Senator Sanders and I introduced a 
bill, and it is already got a lot of bipartisan support. 
Senator Smith, Hickenlooper, Grassley, Coons, Hassan, Ernst, 
and Baldwin.

    This would be transformational. It is a bill that is going 
to force corporate health care to accept transparency and 
competition, not to have barriers to entry for people to get 
into the health care business or try to corner the market with 
high costs along the way.

    I would urge all of you to make sure in a grassroots way 
you get behind it. And until we break that grip to where that 
is in control, we are never going to address this, or many 
other issues related to health care. Thank you for being here 
today.

    The Chair. Well, let me just thank Senator Braun for his 
work and mention to him, this whole issue of corporate and 
private equity control over our health care system is 
exploding. You are right, young doctors don't want to be 
corporate employees. It is an issue we will deal with.

    Senator Hickenlooper.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank all 
of you for being here, but also for your service. You could all 
be making more money doing other things and appreciate your 
commitment.

    I am from Colorado, and we have been working a lot on 
apprenticeships. And I think on a broader scale, they can help 
address the shortage of minority health care professionals.

    Colorado Public Health Works is one of the first of its 
kind that connects AmeriCorps volunteers with a registered 
apprenticeship program run by a Trailhead Institute. Their goal 
is to recruit a more diverse workforce.

    Allows the apprentices to get valuable on the job 
apprenticeship experience while we make progress in our public 
health needs. So, I will start with Dr. Galvez and Dr. 
Andrades.

    How are apprenticeship models and other on the job training 
models particularly helpful in terms of the recruitment and 
retention of diverse healthcare forces? And then follow that up 
with additional Federal support for apprenticeship programs, 
which we have worked on this Committee. Would that be helpful 
also in terms of recruiting students of color?

    Dr. Galvez. Thank you for that question, Senator. The 
apprenticeship model is fantastic. And I think of it from the 
medical side, we frequently shadow.

    Shadowing a physician is where you learn what you 
potentially could be, what you are getting into, right. And so, 
there are some shadowing experiences that aren't great, like at 
an ER where you are passing out juice and blankets. That is not 
really learning about how the ER functions.

    But when you are in an ER where you are taking care of 
patients or helping to translate, and seeing what a physician 
is doing, that buy-in, that spark that was mentioned, that is 
what really gets people hooked, right, that they want to 
proceed and go into that model.

    I think that is a good format, and it likely would reduce 
attrition. Because there are--like an example is you have 
someone who goes to an Ivy League school, right. They want to 
be a doctor.

    Yes, they will get some research experience, but they don't 
they--and yes, they will be shadowing in a clinical setting. 
But it is--you see a high attrition rate in people interested 
in entering medicine who didn't really get a great initial 
experience. And so, apprenticeships I think are a fantastic 
model.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Dr. Andrades.

    Ms. Andrades. I also believe that apprenticeship model is 
probably the best way to help minority students.

    As I mentioned in my testimony, BSEP, the Baystate 
Springfield--educational partnership is really a mentorship 
program between the city of Springfield Public Schools and 
Baystate Medical Center to provide underserved students with 
the opportunity to work alongside different health care 
professionals.

    I think one of the major benefits there is that maybe a 
student may go into it saying, well I want to be a radiology 
tech, but--or I may want to be a nurse, but students have 
followed me, and I work very closely with surgical residents 
and surgeons.

    Maybe that exposure to another level in the health care 
field is integral in them making the decision, Okay, I don't 
just have to be, let's say--I don't have to be in this 
position. I can be the surgeon.

    I can be the nurse practitioner. And again, that program 
really offers them an opportunity that they wouldn't have 
otherwise.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you. I appreciate that. And Dr. 
Braun--or Dr. Braun--Senator Braun and I have worked on this 
and had a lot of support on the Committee. We are making 
progress.

    Dr. Lawson, as you noted in your testimony, CDC reports of 
Black women are tragically two, three, four times more likely 
to die. And we also just heard, a lot of that is due to mental 
health issues. Colorado has a 2023 maternal mortality report 
based on 4 years, 2016 to 2020.

    They found that basically a third of all deaths were 
attributed to suicide or accidental overdose, which is 
staggering. What do you think we can best--how do we best 
address this mental health, substance use disorder epidemic 
that we have?

    Dr. Lawson. That brings up one of our focus areas as an 
organization. There are certain specialties we are worried 
about the workforce and availability.

    I have not been to one state during my presidency during 
this past term where they do not have a shortage of behavioral 
health care providers. I myself practice in Dallas. I am not in 
Podunk, but we still don't have an availability of behavioral 
health care providers.

    There needs to be investments on how we can give 
scholarships for those students, medical students to get them 
interested in that career. Second, thinking about psychologists 
and other specialties, right, that support those services.

    Also, when you think about women, about 55 percent of 
women, even if they had Medicaid, there is a coverage gap. So, 
we got to also think about coverage. Many of my psychiatry 
colleagues do not accept commercial insurance because of low 
reimbursement.

    Really the root cause of this is reimbursement for 
behavioral health care services and showing value on that.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Great. Thank you all. I am out of 
time. I yield back to the Chair. Thank you.

    The Chair. Senator Marshall, did you want to stay----

    Senator Marshall. Well, I just want to again, thank all of 
our witnesses for coming. Thank you for your dedication to the 
health of women and pregnancies and deliveries, and all the 
other aspects of health care. Thank you so much.

    The Chair. I just want to echo Senator Marshall. Thank you 
all. This is without exception, excellent testimony, and we 
look forward to continue to work with you to implement many of 
the very important suggestions that you made. So, thank you 
all. And with that, let me just say that the hearing is over.

    For any Senators who wish to ask additional questions, 
questions for the record will be due in 10 business days, May 
16th at 5.00 p.m.. Finally, I ask unanimous consent to enter 
into the record 12 statements from stakeholder groups.

    [The following information can be found on page 55 in

    The Chair. The Committee stands adjourned. Thank you, 
again.
